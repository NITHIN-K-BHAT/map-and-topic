     <p>The Visegrad Group was founded in 1991 by three central European states that had previously been dominated by Soviet-style communist rule—Czechoslovakia, which was soon to become the Czech Republic (Czechia) and Slovakia, Hungary and Poland. Their co-operation has continued through many stages in their development, and after the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 they appeared to be entering a period of diversification. Although all four countries had forms of populist government at the beginning of the decade, the most problematic were the `illiberal democracies’ of Hungary and Poland, against which the European Union (EU) was taking action for their failure to uphold the rule of law, while changes of government in Slovakia and the Czech Republic gave them a clearly pro-Western orientation that distinguished them from their Visegrad neighbours. In addition, as Russia waged war on Ukraine from February 2022, there was a marked division between the attitudes of Poland and Hungary: while Poland could be considered to be the EU state that was most hostile towards Russia, Hungary proved the most resistant to providing armaments for Ukraine and imposing sanctions on Russia.</p>
     <p>The Ukraine crisis was particularly concerning for all four states. All except the Czech Republic had direct borders with Ukraine, and all were major recipients of refugees from that country. Although protected to an extent by their membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), all had suffered Russian military invasion in some form within living memory. Moreover, concerns about the situation in Ukraine coincided with a cost-of-living crisis that had intensified as the disruption and anxieties of the COVID-19 pandemic receded. Despite the apparent differences between the states’ Governments, all of them also had substantial internal divisions in public attitudes towards both social and economic issues and the EU and Western values.</p>

          <heading>Politics and Populism in the Visegrad States</heading>
          <p>Although the Governments of the Visegrad states are in many respects very different, they have also demonstrated much in common over the last three decades. When the EU (then the European Communities—EC) first made a political commitment at the Copenhagen (Denmark) European Council summit meeting of June 1993 for enlargement to include former communist states in Central and Eastern Europe, the Visegrad states were generally considered to be the leading candidates. Poland and Hungary had already liberalized in the late communist period and the (then) EC’s PHARE (Poland/Hungary Aid for Restructuring of Economies) programme, which assisted post-communist states in the 1990s, was originally set up in 1989 for these two countries. Czechoslovakia had experienced a stifling and repressive form of communism after the Soviet suppression of the `Prague Spring’ reform movement of 1968, but by 1993 the Czechs were making progress that showed the importance of historical legacies: they were the most advanced nation ever to be subjected to communist rule, and in the inter-war period had run one of the most politically and economically successful states in the world.</p>
          <p>The only `troublesome’ candidate among the Visegrad states was initially Slovakia, which was generally (though not entirely correctly) blamed for splitting up Czechoslovakia, and where the first post-independence Prime Minister, Vladimír Mečiar, had demonstrated a lack of respect for democratic rules that by 1997-98 had almost led to Slovakia being excluded from the first wave of the EU’s eastern enlargement. It therefore seems ironic that two decades later Slovakia was in some ways the least troublesome EU member state of the Visegrad Group, being the only such state to have adopted the euro. The most serious challenge was presented by Hungary, where the right-wing leader Viktor Orbán, in power continuously since 2010, had first coined the term `illiberal democracy’ in 2014. At that point, it was an alarming concept for believers in the form of Western liberal democracy on which the EU is founded, but it was interpreted as a sign of how grave a danger Orbán posed to democracy in Hungary, and not as a genuine threat to the larger and more powerful Western democracies. However, in the years that followed populism also became a greater challenge in many established Western democracies.</p>
          <p>Prime Minister Orbán’s party, Fidesz—Magyar Polgári Szövetség (Fidesz, Federation of Young Democrats—Hungarian Civic Alliance), long enjoyed a measure of protection from belonging to the largest group in the European Parliament, the European People’s Party (EPP). This diminished in the run-up to the 2019 European Parliament elections, when Orbán caused outrage by directly attacking European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker (who had been the EPP candidate for the position following the European Parliament elections in 2014) in a poster campaign. Fidesz’s membership of the EPP was suspended in March 2019, and in March 2021 Orbán’s party left the group, in part to avoid expulsion, and became the largest group of non-aligned members, as the Eurosceptic right in the European Parliament attempted to rearrange its party groups. When Orbán secured his fourth successive parliamentary victory in April 2022, once again with the two-thirds’ majority of deputies necessary to change the Constitution, the EU acted promptly in triggering a procedure for dealing with Hungary’s violations of the rule of law. </p>
          <p>With populism on the rise in the EU as a whole, Hungary was not to remain the only Visegrad state with politics that diverged markedly from the Social Democrat versus Christian Democrat polarity that was still easily recognizable in many Western European countries. In October 2015 a populist right Government came to power in Poland that was to prove nearly as problematic for the EU as Orbán’s Government in Hungary. The right-wing Prawo i Sprawiedliwość (PiS—Law and Justice party) was a member of the smaller Eurosceptic, right-of-centre European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group in the European Parliament. However, the PiS-led Polish Government did not enjoy the dominant parliamentary position of its counterpart in Hungary: although in 2015 PiS became the first party to obtain an outright majority in the Sejm (Assembly), and it was re-elected in 2019, Poland also had an upper chamber, the Senat (Senate), in which PiS lost its majority.</p>
          <p>In the Czech Republic, a shift to populism appeared to take place when the ANO (YES) party of Andrej Babiš became the largest single party in the legislature in the elections of October 2017, forming a coalition with the Česká Strana Sociálně Demokratická (ČSSD—Czech Social Democratic Party). A Slovakian-born entrepreneur, Babiš had become one of the richest individuals in the Czech Republic, but was regarded as problematic, both domestically and at EU level, owing to his companies’ alleged misuse of EU funding. However, despite concerns about high-level corruption, the country was not marked by the illiberalism and conservatism of its populist neighbours and Babiš was the only Prime Minister of the Visegrad states whose party belonged to the liberal Renew Europe group in the European Parliament, while his coalition partners were part of the centre-left Socialists and Democrats (S&amp;D) group. Furthermore, the country was never threatened by the one-party domination witnessed in Hungary and Poland, and the October 2021 elections brought about an alternation of power, with a liberal-conservative coalition taking office. The new Prime Minister, Petr Fiala, a politics professor, was leader of the Občanská Demokratická Strana (ODS—Civic Democratic Party), which had a history of Euroscepticism and was a member of the ECR in the European Parliament, but he was a respected moderate. Most of his smaller coalition partners were members of the EPP, while the progressive Pirátská Strana (Pirate Party), which nominated the new Czech foreign minister, belonged to the Greens/European Free Alliance in the European Parliament.</p>
          <p>The Czech Republic’s moderate and pro-Western orientation was further reinforced in the January 2023 presidential election, when in the second round former Prime Minister Babiš was defeated by Petr Pavel, a former general and Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, who as Chairman of the NATO Military Committee in 2015-18 was the highest-ranking NATO officer-holder ever to come from a post-communist country. His election broke a developing Czech pattern of electing former prime ministers as President, and he appeared a much more solid office-holder than the previous President, Miloš Zeman, a former social-democratic Prime Minister who had broken away from his own party and become increasingly eccentric and populist as his health failed.</p>
          <p>Slovakia’s relationship with the EU has in recent years been less confrontational than that of its Visegrad neighbours, although the country was not exempt from political turbulence. When for the first time it experienced the murder of a journalist in February 2018, public protests led to the resignation of the long-serving Prime Minister, Robert Fico, whose left-nationalist Smer-Sociálna Demokracia (Smer-SD—Direction-Social Democracy) belonged to the S&amp;D group in the European Parliament, despite having displayed distinctly nationalist and xenophobic attitudes both during the 2015-16 refugee crisis and in domestic politics. The Smer-SD government coalition survived Fico’s resignation, but was replaced in parliamentary elections at the end of February 2020 by a four-party, centre-right coalition under maverick politician Igor Matovič of the Obyčajní Ľudia a Nezávislé Osobnosti (OĽaNO—Ordinary People and Independent Personalities) party. Although OĽaNO appeared to be a quintessential populist party, its commitment to combating corruption proved genuine and its most marked success was the arrest and prosecution of corrupt police chiefs, prosecutors, judges and politicians alike, culminating in April 2022 with serious criminal charges (later dropped) being brought against former Prime Minister Fico, together with his former Minister of the Interior, Robert Kaliňák.</p>
          <p>However, the Slovakian Government was the most fractious among the Visegrad states, and this was reflected in the international allegiances of the coalition members, which included member parties of the EPP, the ECR and the more extreme right Identity and Democracy (ID) group in the European Parliament. Matovič lacked the political survival skills of his populist counterparts elsewhere, and after just over a year he was forced to exchange posts with his Minister of Finance, Eduard Heger. Although the new Prime Minister proved better able to deal with the competing ambitions of his coalition partners, the Government finally lost its majority when one of them withdrew in September 2022. Heger remained in office until May 2023, even after losing a vote of no confidence in December, because the Slovakian Constitution made it exceptionally hard to call early elections, and the moderate and liberal President Zuzana Čaputová, whose party was not in parliament, was reluctant to appoint a non-party government of experts. At the end of January 2023, however, early elections were scheduled for the end of September (after the parliament voted to amend the Constitution), and when the President eventually appointed a technocratic Government under Ľudovit Ódor, the Deputy Governor of the central bank, it faced a chaotic parliament primarily interested in election campaigning.</p>

          <heading>Illiberalism in Central Europe</heading>
          <p>Given Poland and Hungary’s leading role in the transition from communism to democracy in Eastern Europe, it came as a surprise that these two states were the first deemed to challenge the EU’s core democratic principles. Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU—last amended by the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009) states that: `The Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities. These values are common to the Member States in a society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail.’ The EU’s Copenhagen criteria, established in 1993 to judge whether candidate states were ready for membership, laid down very similar principles, with which the Visegrad states had to comply in order to secure accession. However, once they became EU members in 2004, enforcing their compliance with EU standards of democracy became a more complex issue.</p>
          <p>Article 7 of the TEU lays down what should happen if a member state deviates from its core democratic principles. Ultimately it provides for the suspension of certain rights, including the voting rights (but not obligations) of a member state where there is `a serious and persistent breach’ of the values laid down in Article 2, but only after a procedure that at one point requires unanimity by all member states except the state concerned.</p>
          <p>However, in dealing with the erosion of democratic standards in Hungary and Poland, there have been two major problems. The first has been a reluctance to trigger the processes established in Article 7 of the TEU. It was regarded as a `nuclear option’ likely to have less helpful results than other forms of pressure on states in deterring them from unacceptable policies. Consequently, the EU failed to take effective action against Hungary during the 2010-14 Orbán Government, which introduced measures to restrict the effectiveness of the Constitutional Court and the freedom of the media.</p>
          <p>Eventually, in December 2017 the European Commission proposed that the European Council should trigger Article 7, not against Hungary, but Poland. However, the EU faced a second problem in launching Article 7: having failed to take action against Hungary, there were now two states with democratic deficits, which were almost certain to support each other, thereby preventing the unanimity necessary for adopting sanctions under Article 7.</p>
          <p>In the case of Hungary, in September 2018 it was eventually the European Parliament that voted, with a majority of over two-thirds, to ask EU member states to evaluate, in accordance with Article 7 of the TEU, whether Hungary was `at risk of breaching the EU’s founding values’. Hungary had already been subject to European Commission legal action on a range of issues, including laws against non-governmental organizations (NGOs), amendments to its higher education law and changes to asylum procedures, and the Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) who finally pressed for action against Hungary were concerned over issues including judicial independence, freedom of expression, corruption, the rights of minorities and the situation of migrants and refugees.</p>
          <p>This was the first time that the Parliament (as opposed to the European Commission) had made such a move. Action at Council level was delayed until after the European Parliament elections in May 2019 and, as in the case of Poland, action by the Council was painstakingly slow, much to the dismay of many MEPs. Hungary also applied to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to overturn the European Parliament’s 2018 vote, on the grounds that it had not achieved a two-thirds’ majority if abstentions were taken into account. This argument was rejected by the ECJ, but not until the beginning of June 2021.</p>
          <p>However, despite repeated European Council hearings and European Parliament resolutions, the situation failed to improve. In December 2021 the EU announced that it was initiating an infringement procedure after Poland’s Constitutional Tribunal ruled in October that national law had precedence over EU law, which undermined a fundamental principle on which the EU is constructed. The Commission also cast doubt on the independence and impartiality of the Polish Tribunal judges. Further infringement proceedings were launched in April 2022 relating to a new disciplinary regime for Polish judges which was considered to violate judicial independence. By this point, however, with the pandemic easing in 2022, and member states receiving EU funds to alleviate its effects, the focus of EU action had shifted away from the use of Article 7, which was proving so cumbersome, and had moved to financial penalties.</p>

          <heading>EU Funding and the Fight against Illiberalism</heading>
          <p>A particular concern for some of the largest net contributors to the EU budget was the absurdity of countries that were among the greatest recipients of EU funds becoming the Union’s most vociferous critics and permitting the corrupt allocation of funding—a problem highlighted by the situation in Hungary under Orbán. It was also hard to justify financial solidarity with states that had themselves shown little solidarity during the refugee crisis of 2015-16, becoming vociferous opponents of any quotas for relocating asylum seekers. With budget cuts necessary once the UK withdrew from the EU, and the EU institutions equally determined to increase spending, the European Commission’s new, seven-year Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) budget for 2021-27 was bound to become the focus of conflict between member states.</p>
          <p>When the budget proposals were presented, it was clear that the amounts paid to member states as structural funds were to be reduced, while spending on migration and border management was to rise significantly. This would result in less EU funding for the Visegrad states, and more support allocated to the southern European countries that had borne the brunt of the refugee crisis. More controversial, however, was a separate European Commission proposal in May 2018 for a regulation on `Sound Financial Management and the Rule of Law’, which would enable access to EU funding to be suspended or restricted in cases of `a generalised deficiency’ in the rule of law that could affect `sound financial management or the financial interests of the Union’.</p>
          <p>The proposal presented a means to counter the problem that Article 7, which sanctioned a member state explicitly for breaching democratic principles, required unanimity among all other member states. Adoption of a regulation, however, required only a qualified majority of 55% of member states, representing 65% of the EU population.</p>
          <p>Financial issues were further complicated by the COVID-19 crisis and the fact that the separate Next Generation EU (NGEU) fund was under negotiation, together with the new MFF budget. In July 2020 a European Council meeting agreed that conditionality on the rule of law should be introduced at the same time as the MFF and NGEU. However, while the conditionality regulation could be passed by a qualified majority of member states, approval of the MFF required unanimity. Hungary and Poland made it clear that they were prepared to veto the EU’s new seven-year budget, worth over €1,000,000m., and with it the NGEU funds designed to promote post-COVID-19 economic renewal, rather than accept rule of law conditionality in the allocation of EU funds. However, under the new European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, a former German defence minister, agreement on the EU’s budget was finally reached at the December European Council meeting. </p>
          <p>After the rejection of complaints brought by Poland and Hungary at the European Court of Justice (ECJ), in February 2022 it was clarified that the European Commission could not only continue to block the two countries’ access to COVID-19 recovery funds, but also to all of the EU’s seven-year budget. On 27 April, following the Hungarian parliamentary elections earlier that month, the European Commission finally triggered the rule of law mechanism against Hungary. In December it froze Hungary’s 2021-27 cohesion funding, worth €22,000m., because of problems with judiciary independence, academic freedoms, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender and intersex (LGBTI+) rights and the asylum system, as well as withholding some €6,000m. from the pandemic recovery fund. Poland, meanwhile, had received a daily fine of €1m, for failing to respect a ECJ order to dissolve a disciplinary chamber for judges, as well as having over €30,000m. withheld from the EU recovery fund.</p>
          <p>What ensued from the EU’s conditionality mechanisms was a complex process of negotiation with both the Hungarian and Polish Governments, in which milestones and reforms were agreed after lengthy discussion, leading to further complex monitoring procedures. It should be noted, however, that both Governments had a fundamental problem in their relations with the EU: whatever hostility they felt towards the EU’s demands on them, and however much they felt that their voters supported their conservative stances on issues such as LGBTI+ rights and immigration, the option of leaving the EU was not available to them, and was rarely mentioned even by individual politicians. This was because the European Commission’s Eurobarometer public opinion polls, and other similar surveys, repeatedly showed that Hungarian and Polish citizens were more positive about their countries’ membership than, for example, the Czech and Slovakian populations were. </p>

          <heading>From the COVID-19 Pandemic to Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine</heading>
          <p>Since the European Parliament last held elections in May 2019, the EU’s battle to support the rule of law in Hungary and Poland has taken place against the background of two major unexpected crises: the COVID-19 pandemic that took hold early in 2020, followed by the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. </p>
          <p>A major aspect of managing the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis was combating the economic effects of protracted lockdowns, and it was into this challenging situation, with energy prices already rising alarmingly, that the tense situation on the Ukrainian border, where Russian troops had been concentrated for several months, finally erupted into warfare as Russia invaded its neighbour in what it termed a `special military operation’. While the Visegrad Four states had relatively similar experiences during the pandemic, more diversity was shown in their attitudes to Russia after the invasion of Ukraine. </p>
          <p>The Visegrad states faced not only the threat to their own security posed by aggressive Russian action near their borders, but also the huge practical problem associated with the large numbers of Ukrainian refugees flowing across their borders, particularly at the beginning of the war. Although some refugees returned home in mid-2022, and others moved west, by early 2023 some 4m. people from Ukraine had been granted temporary protection in the EU, of whom around 1m. were in Poland—just below the number who had entered Germany, a state over twice as populous—and some 500,000 in the Czech Republic, a far smaller country, while there were around 100,000 in Slovakia, the smallest Visegrad state, with a population of around 5.5m. Hungary was the exception in the Visegrad Four, with only some 30,000 refugees, despite having a population of nearly 10m., approaching that of the Czech Republic.</p>
          <p>Hungary’s reaction to the war was also notably divergent in other respects. The Czech Republic’s new Government, and later its new President, were strongly supportive of Ukraine, and in this respect it was more than matched by Poland, which had long been one of the NATO states most concerned about the Russian threat, and which had the largest contingent of US troops on its territory of any Visegrad country. For Poland, its staunch support for a tough EU stance was a useful opportunity to project a positive image after all the criticism it had received on rule of law issues. Fear of Russia also united the different sides of the Polish political divide, and the state’s generous support of Ukraine was notable considering the somewhat troubled relationship between the two countries during the 20th century.</p>
          <p>The Slovakian Government was also quick to declare support for Ukraine, and public opinion initially turned against Russia. However, by the first half of 2023 popular Slovakian views of the war were becoming the most problematic in the Visegrad Four, with both Eurobarometer surveys and those carried out by the respected Slovakian-based NGO GLOBSEC showing Slovakians to be the least welcoming Visegrad citizens towards Ukrainian refugees and also the most hostile to EU financing of military aid for Ukraine. Slovakia had also become generally the most Eurosceptic of the four states, and the least favourable towards NATO membership, with a May survey indicating that more than one-third of respondents were in favour of leaving the Alliance.</p>
          <p>Although Hungary initially condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Orbán soon shifted his stance to become the most pro-Russian leader of any EU state. Unlike the other three Visegrad states, Hungary not only refused to provide arms to Ukraine, but also blocked the transit of military aid from other states through Hungary. As relations with the EU deteriorated after the parliamentary elections in April 2022, Hungary increasingly became the veto player in EU action against Russia, and although it agreed to initial rounds of sanctions against Russia, most subsequent EU proposals were met with obstruction in various forms.</p>
          <p>In general terms, however, the war in Ukraine, rather like the COVID-19 crisis, engendered solidarity between the Visegrad Four and the EU and NATO. With the exception of Hungary, their Governments supported the EU and NATO’s moral stance on Ukraine, and in return received both military security and financial aid from wealthier Western neighbours. </p>

     <gen-section print-style="COLUMN" sllink="SLSDOC" slsdocrf="GEN-SECTREF">
          <heading>The Visegrad Four and the Future of the EU</heading>
          <p>The outlook for the Visegrad Four in 2023 above all demonstrated uncertainty about the future. The Czech Republic appeared the most Western-orientated of the four states, with a moderate pro-Western Government and President, no major national elections due until 2025 and far weaker conservative religious values than elsewhere in the Visegrad Four, but the populist ANO party remained strong, and some large street demonstrations against the rising cost of living were held at which some protesters also expressed pro-Russian sentiments. </p>
          <p>The situation in Slovakia was even more precarious, with legislative elections due in September 2023 and former Prime Minister Fico of Smer-SD leading in opinion polls, albeit with less than one-fifth of the vote. Since his views had gradually edged towards extremism, opposing COVID-19 vaccination and demonstrating increasingly pro-Russian sentiments, and he was a potential partner for smaller far-right parties, there was international alarm at the prospect of him leading a new government. However, the leadership of any future government was likely to depend on the collaboration of the Smer-SD breakaway party, Hlas—Sociálna Demokracia (Voice—Social Democracy), which was not attracted by a coalition with either Smer-SD or the far right.</p>
          <p>Hungary and Poland remained more problematic, however, not only because of their disputes with the EU but also because they had both been dominated by a single party for more than one parliamentary term (with the President also coming from the same party, and therefore not acting in a `checks and balances’ capacity). In this respect, Orbán’s Fidesz had a stronger hold over Hungary than did the PiS over Poland, and with parliamentary elections due in Poland in late 2023, there was increased uncertainty. Despite concerns that the Polish Government might attempt to manipulate the electoral process—although it would be constrained in any such attempt by high levels of international observation—it could not be discounted that the former Prime Minister of Poland, and later President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, could return to power in an effort to transform Poland’s fortunes, or at least that PiS might be weakened by the need for new government coalition partners.</p>
          <p>The contrast between Poland and Hungary on the one hand and the Czech Republic and Slovakia on the other becomes even more stark when the `Global Freedom Scores’ of US-based NGO Freedom House are taken into consideration. In 2022 Hungary became the first EU member state to be classified as `partly free’ rather than `free’. Its ranking declined again, by three points, in 2023, to score 66 out of 100, so that it ranked slightly lower than EU candidate states Albania, Montenegro and North Macedonia. Poland, with a score of 81, was the third-lowest ranked EU member state (behind Bulgaria, as well as Hungary), while the Czech Republic and Slovakia had an average score for the EU member states as a whole and both ranked marginally higher than France. The Freedom House `Nations in Transit’ report for 2023, which focused in particular on post-communist states, also ranked the Czech Republic and Slovakia as `consolidated democracies’, while Poland was `semi-consolidated’, like all six EU candidate and potential candidate states in the Western Balkans, and Hungary was a `transitional or hybrid regime’, like the new candidate and potential candidate states further east: Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia.</p>
          <p>It is in the context of further EU enlargement that the democratic failings of Poland and Hungary pose a particularly difficult challenge for the EU, together with their divergence in social values. Hungary and Poland’s hostility to LGBTI+ communities and what they term `gender ideology’ is shared by Slovakia and to a lesser extent by the Czech Republic, and commitment to net-zero carbon targets was lower in the Visegrad Four. With the legacy of communist rule proving more potent than the strength of Catholic religious belief in determining the attitude of European states to LGBTI+ rights, the fact that, with the exception of Türkiye, all the current 10 candidate and potential candidate states of the EU have had a communist past is problematic, given that this also overlaps with legacies of authoritarianism and weak civil societies.</p>
          <p>With 11 of the current 27 EU members having formerly been part of either the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact military alliance or the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, there is the strong prospect of a situation where over one-half of the states voting in the European Council have a communist past. Against this background, the transgressions of Hungary and Poland, which were once so far ahead in the transition to democracy, is alarming for the future of European integration.</p>
          <p>The dilemma this presents to the EU is more acute because of the challenges posed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In June 2022, anxious to support Ukraine, the EU abandoned its long-held view that its `Eastern partnership’ with former Soviet states in Eastern Europe did not hold any membership perspective, and it designated Ukraine a candidate for EU accession. When Ukraine had applied to join the EU at the end of February 2022, it was shortly followed by Moldova and Georgia—two other states with breakaway regions controlled by pro-Russian administrations—and Moldova was also granted candidate status, with Georgia designated a `potential candidate’, putting it on a par with Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
          <p>It is clear that preparing for EU membership will be a very long-term process for Ukraine. No state has acceded to the EU since Croatia joined in 2013, and North Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia have all been candidate states for over a decade, while Türkiye has been a candidate since 1999. Much lies in the hands of the candidate state, and Türkiye and Serbia have, like Hungary and Poland, suffered declines of over 10 percentage points in their Freedom House Global Freedom Score in the last 10 years. Nevertheless, the capacity of the EU `to absorb new members, while maintaining the momentum of European integration’ has always been an important part of the 1993 Copenhagen criteria, which include the political and economic conditions that candidates have to fulfil in order to join the EU.</p>
          <p>It therefore remains questionable whether Ukraine’s EU membership, which its President, Volodomyr Zelensky, strenuously desires, is not partly being blocked by the fact that Poland—a strong supporter of Ukrainian membership—and Hungary are currently such problematic members. In 2024 further challenges for the EU are anticipated, since Hungary is due to take over the six-month presidency of the Council of the EU, which rotates between member states. A June 2023 resolution of the European Parliament has already questioned the credibility of Hungary’s scheduled presidency, setting a new challenge for the standoff between the EU and its backsliding democracies.</p>
