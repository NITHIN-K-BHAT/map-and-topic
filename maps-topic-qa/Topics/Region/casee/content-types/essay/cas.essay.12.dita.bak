          <heading>Introduction</heading>
          <p>In the past, Baltic independence was intimately tied to events relating to the Russian Empire and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). Owing to revolutionary changes within both polities, the three Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania declared independence in 1918 (and after wars of independence signed peace treaties with Soviet Russia). Following five decades of subsequent occupation under communist rule, they regained independence at the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s.</p>
          <p>At the end of the Cold War, the collapse of the USSR and the preceding Baltic `singing revolutions’ did not immediately grant democratic sovereignty, stability and security to the Baltic states. First, starting in January 1991 in Lithuania, and subsequently, with fewer casualties, in Latvia and Estonia, the popular desire for independence marked a series of violent confrontations between the Soviet armed forces and the Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian civilian populations.</p>
          <p>At the outset popular support for breaking ties with Moscow varied throughout Europe. For some states like the Visegrad states of Central Europe or the Baltic states, the communist union, characterized for them by oppression and subjugation, was maintained only by means of a large army and pervasive government bureaucracy rather than reciprocal interests. For example, while Soviet troops brought electricity and irrigation to Central Asia, they also brought Soviet troops from underdeveloped regions of the USSR to the Baltics. Amid social resistance and with US support (for the promise to leave the Baltic states), US President Bill Clinton’s Administration provided funds for the construction of apartments in the Russian Federation for departing Russian military officers. Even when the USSR had ceased to exist, the Soviet/Russian army did not fully withdraw from the Baltic states until 1994.</p>
          <p>Once the Baltic states were liberated from Soviet/Russian control, government and commercial transformation became possible. The Government installed under Mart Laar in Estonia in 1992 led the Baltic transformation, but Latvia and Lithuania soon followed suit. The challenge was to transform the Soviet system and the popular mindset to adapt to democratic governance and liberal market reforms (Bohle and Greskovits, 2012). This transformation required breaking ties with the Russian monetary system (by adopting their own national currencies), reorientating imports and exports (to depend less on the Russian market), and most importantly ensuring transparent and democratic governance.</p>
          <p>First, to ensure security and stability, the primary motivation was the most rapid possible adaptation in order to secure membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and thus guarantee security and irreversible independence and, second, to join the European and US-based welfare state community and the European Union (EU). In 2004 the dual enlargement of the EU and NATO took place, with the organizations admitting several states from Central and Eastern Europe. This inducement served well for the successful implementation of market and institutional reforms to largely meet EU institutional standards and to adopt the democratic standards required to satisfy the criteria for entry into NATO. Once this domestic and foreign policy objective was fulfilled, the question remained: what to do next? The Baltic states now seemed militarily secure owing to their membership of NATO and the EU.</p>
          <p>What remained was social, institutional and commercial transformation to embrace liberal democratic standards, and to integrate even more closely with the Western international order, focusing on democratic principles and the rule of law. For small countries like the Baltic states, this was the only path to democratic sovereignty and normative equality with larger powers. If until 2004 the reforms introduced to achieve the pre-requisites for NATO and EU membership were possible due to a strong democratic consensus in all three Baltic states, further transformation after the dual enlargement of NATO and the EU became more difficult, but was no less important for the security and stability of Estonia, Latvia or Lithuania. If all three were normatively secure by 2004, their domestic structures were, nevertheless, both sensitive and vulnerable if not properly transformed away from communist traditions and designs.</p>
          <p>To evaluate how well the Baltic states have transformed to become better democracies since 2004, the main areas affecting democratic transition are first outlined. The objective is to find the areas with the most profound effect on democratic transition. Criteria suggested by the independent non-governmental organization Freedom House, such as election process, civilian society, independent media, national and local democratic governance, independence and framework of judiciary, and corruption have been used to assess their impact on democratic transformation.</p>
          <p>The reference point for these independent variables is 2013 (approximately a decade after the 2004 enlargement of the Euro-Atlantic community and a almost decade prior to Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine). After examining major indicators demonstrating the democratic transition, cases in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania that suggest the need for further democratic adaptation are examined. This transformation is assessed in the context of persistent security challenges in relation to Russia.</p>

          <heading>The Criteria for Democratic Transition away from the Communist Tradition</heading>
          <p>The integration of the Baltic states into the EU (to be labelled democracies) was the criteria for the admission of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia to NATO. The result of dual membership of the Euro-Atlantic community was military security (guaranteed by the transatlantic alliance) and economic and social stability (assured by close integration into the European community). The most important task for all three Baltic states was the adoption of EU institutional and legal norms. Democratic governance and institutional frameworks were crucial, as outlined by one of the EU’s architects, Jean Monnet: `nothing becomes permanent without institutions.’</p>
          <p>In the 1990s one of the principal challenges to the smooth democratic transition and to the adaptation to institutional norms was corruption: the Soviet-type system hitherto in place served narrow interests, and offered only top-down governance. After regaining independence, the Baltic states had to expunge the consequences of this communist legacy, such as corruption in the legal system, the public sector and administration (Kalniņš, 2001 and 2002; Kalniņš and Čigāne, 2003).</p>
          <p>Multiple civil organizations (financed by US and European donors) supported the introduction of a transparent and fair legal system and efficient anti-corruption bodies. Civil society and a free media became crucial elements of this democratic transition, frequently despised by those former communist groups that were clinging to power inside the Baltic states. Corruption and abuse of power are factors that continue to create fault lines in the relationship between the political elite and wider society.</p>
          <p>The Baltic states were not alone in facing such challenges. Under Vladimír Mečiar, who dominated Slovakian politics in 1990-98, Slovakia effectively disqualified itself from NATO membership in 1999 (when the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland were admitted to the Alliance). The experiences of the former Soviet countries and satellites states are shared throughout the Visegrad, Baltic and former Yugoslav countries, within Central Asia and elsewhere, and serve as good examples to assess democratic adaptation.</p>
          <p>To underline the argument, 29 transition countries were selected for analysis, with data taken from 2013 (approximately a decade after the 2004 EU and NATO enlargements, and a decade prior to the time of writing in 2023). The sample group consisted of Visegrad and Baltic states, as well as countries from the South Caucasus, Central Asia, the former Yugoslavia, and other countries including Romania, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Ukraine, Moldova, the Russian Federation and Belarus. The independent variable was democracy (using data from the Polity IV Project of the US-based Center for Systemic Peace, 2013), which was assessed against other variables such as election process, civil society, independent media, national democratic governance, local democratic governance, judicial framework and independence, and corruption (Freedom House, 2013).</p>
          <p>The evaluation of data by multivariate regression (to measure the degree of correlation between the independent and dependent variables) allowed for the degree of democratic transition to be assessed at 75% (the adjusted rate is 74%), which is significant within the social sciences (considering that no economic indicators such as gross domestic product per head have been taken into consideration). Multivariate regression allowed conclusions to be drawn on the salience of four principal factors positively affecting democratic transition.</p>
          <p>Measures evaluating the health of civil society and the decline in corruption were the most salient and statistically credible factors linked to democratic transition. All 29 countries experienced significant progress towards a positive democratic transition, with declines in corruption levels and the presence of a healthy and active civil society. It must be noted there is a correlation between low levels of corruption and strong civil society (custodians of transparent and fair governance).</p>
          <p>The other two factors supporting positive democratic transition are an independent media and a sound judicial framework and independence. Considering the rather small sample size, the statistical analysis is significant, with a P value for both factors that is not higher than 0.1—a P value below 0.1 suggests that only 1% of cases will not correspond with the suggested positive democratic transition if there are improved media freedoms and a stronger legal system and courts.</p>
          <p>In addition, a strong media and sound legal systems and institutions have positive effects on anti-corruption patterns, acting as watchdogs in fair and transparent states. There is a strong reciprocity between low levels of corruption, a healthy media environment, strong civil society, and a sound legal system and institutions. All of these factors have positive effects on the democratic transition and, ultimately, also development, where society and political elites are institutionally well-embedded and share strong social consensus (Evans, 1989).</p>
          <p>This positive democratic transition and development domestically has had strong implications for external threats to the Baltic states (Connor, 1992). Communism had destroyed much of civilian society, freedoms, including media freedom, and any resemblance to a fair system that was not built around elites, leaving a state of affairs that was as close to a social and moral vacuum as was conceivable in a complex, relatively advanced industrial (albeit corrupt) society such as the USSR (Sandle, 1999). The deviation of the Baltic states from communist traditions towards democracy was observed with trepidation by the Russian Federation.</p>
          <p>Thus, Russia has consistently attempted to sustain close ties in two ways. First, it attempted to ensure the obedience of Baltic political elites through a powerful combination of inducement and economic benefit (the so-called pragmatic approach of the Baltic states toward Russia). The abundance of resources and the former Soviet traditions familiar to the ex-communist political groups inside the Baltic states served as a good background for closer co-operation from the outset.</p>
          <p>Second, Russia’s intention has remained to protect its territory against external pressure and, finally, the country’s aspiration to retain the countries with ethnic Russian or Russian-speaking communities within Russia’s sphere of influence (Svarin, 2016). This objective has been possible due to the use of the media and communication with Russian-speaking communities abroad offering narratives of the Russian Federation as a custodian of conservative values, and a guardian of the interests of Russian-speakers and the Orthodox Church. These narratives create divisions in national and regional co-operation, both domestically and at the Baltic level.</p>

          <heading>Russian Security Interests and Narratives of `Pribaltika’</heading>
          <p>The term `Pribaltika’ has been used in Russia to describe the Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian territories as a zone of strategic interest during the period of Russian Empire/Soviet occupation and russification. Inside the Russian Federation, there has been an enduring and increasing anxiety that since Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were growing richer when separated from the Kremlin’s control, the economic success of the Baltic states would serve to undermine the unity of Russia. Meanwhile, the narrative that the Baltic states would fail without the support and patronage of Russia has been strong, particularly among those who mourn the collapse of the USSR and deplore the Baltic reorientation to the West (Veebel, Markus and Vihmand, 2020).</p>
          <p>Inside Russia, there is a long-term geopolitical objective to take back everything that has been lost since the collapse of the USSR and the Russian Empire. With the reinstallation of imperial symbols on the Russian flag as well as the return of the former Soviet (now Russian) anthem, this popular nostalgia was, symbolically, evident in Russia by 2000. Then, in 2005, shortly after the previous year’s dual enlargement of the EU and NATO, Russian President Vladimir Putin openly declared the collapse of the USSR to have been `the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century’.</p>
          <p>This desire to reclaim past grandeur and surging anti-Western attitudes among the Russian public have been growing, presenting images of the enemy through bellicose rhetoric, and painting the outside world and even formerly familiar Ukraine as unsympathetic and threatening (Mendras, 2015). This has been the case since the Russian occupation of Crimea and the surge in hybrid war tactics in Ukraine in 2014, but Russia’s full-scale war against Ukraine since February 2022 has only bolstered the fear and sense of precariousness of those in the Baltics. For Ukraine, in particular, the eventual military aggression and subsequent widespread suffering was linked to the impact of domestic corruption and the close ties of political elites in Ukraine with the Kremlin in the recent past.</p>
          <p>There is a pervasive sense in the Baltics that no alliance with Russia, no brotherly union, nothing, except NATO membership has stopped Russia from military aggression against other states. Moreover, in the context of countries that belong to the transatlantic security alliance, Russia can use its abundant resources and hybrid tools to undermine domestic coherence even in the USA. This can be exemplified by the widely cited Russian interference in the outcome of the 2016 US presidential election, using media and communication tools to disseminate Russian narratives and misinformation in an effort to bring to power Putin’s preferred candidate. Such political interference is a grave threat, particularly in smaller and more vulnerable Baltic states, if corruption and Russian narratives succeed in undermining democratic institutions and social coherence (Sherr, 2013).</p>
          <p>In 2003 liberal Russian politician, economist and business executive Anatolii Chubais had espoused the idea of a `liberal empire’, where Russian energy pipelines and electricity transmission lines and the purchases of major foreign economic assets like refineries by Russian companies would replace the Red Army as Russia’s means of regaining influence in Europe, consolidating ties with its old neighbourhood, and attracting new political support (Hill and Gaddy, 2013). Thus, Russian state funds and assets inside the Baltic states would allow Russia to sustain political control. Conversely, improved anti-corruption practices and transparency would provide for increased trust in both government and the eventual democratic transition domestically and reduce the influence of the Kremlin over the Baltic political processes—trends that had been strongly supported by the Baltic populations until and beyond 2004 (Fukuyama and McFaul, 2008).</p>
          <p>Externally, Moscow has always tried to portray the Baltic states as either failed or failing without Russia’s support. Kremlin narratives about the Baltic states are often negative and can include views about the Baltic states as `Western puppet states’ and thus a threat to Russian interests in the region. Russian media outlets also focus heavily on alleged human rights violations in the region, particularly focusing on actions ostensibly taken by the Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian governments against Russian-speakers (while ignoring comparable infringements by Russia). Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were regarded by the Russian public as the three countries most hostile to Russia and Russians right up until Russia’s aggression against Georgia in 2008 (Šrāders, 2021).</p>
          <p>
      Russia has frequently portrayed the Baltic states as suffering economically without access to the Russian market, and Western-type democratic regimes as exploitative and decadent in contrast to the ostensibly balanced and mutual partnership with Moscow. These kinds of narratives are commonly referred to in terms of the `Russkiy Mir’ (`Russian World’ or the `Russian order’), which helps to paint a picture of Russian exceptionalism 
      <i>vis-á-vis</i>
       other countries. The implications of this concept beyond Russia’s borders is to act as inducement for the Baltic states to embrace special relations with, and the leadership of, Moscow (Vorontsova, 1997).
    </p>
          <p>Moreover, Kremlin narratives regarding the Baltic states centre on issues of security, economic relations and sovereignty (Gordon, Baev and Burila, 2008). These narratives often reason that the Baltic states, as members of NATO and the EU, consequently lack both sovereignty and security, and are driven by especially US, but more broadly Western, interests, rather than those of their own people. Finally, Russia repeatedly asserts that the Baltic states, particularly Estonia and Latvia with their larger Russian-speaking minorities (and all three together as Western puppets), are intrinsically Russophobic and, therefore, hostile towards both Russia and its people. Russian state media frequently highlights purported difficulties in the integration of and discrimination against the Russian-speaking populations of Latvia and Estonia, to portray the Baltic states as hostile to Russians. Such trends foster a more antagonistic attitude among the local populations of the Baltic states against their democratic institutions.</p>
          <p>Russia has come full circle. In the early 1990s it seemed eager to become a part of the Western democratic community. Next it started to simulate democracy and then, after Putin’s comeback in 2012, it began openly to challenge it (Bildt, 2015). Smaller, neighbouring countries that have previously been allies, `small brothers’ or `special zones of interest’ have become adversaries and ostensible `Nazi’ threats to the Kremlin. There has been a concerted propaganda offensive, portrayed as a necessary counterstrike against fascists in Ukraine, which, Russia asserts, in concert with NATO, seeks to persecute Russian-speakers or harm Russia’s strategic and security interests by preparing for military aggression against Russia itself (Bildt, 2015). For these reasons, the Russian occupation since 2014 of Crimea holds a special meaning for most Russians, for whom Crimea is regarded as almost sacred, inspiring strong emotions, and for whom the annexation is seen as an attempt to defend Russian national interests. In annexing Crimea, Putin vowed to defend the rights of ethnic Russians and those who identify themselves with Russia, wherever they might live (Trenin, 2015).</p>
          <p>The Baltic states, as members of NATO and the EU, enjoy external institutional stability and security guarantees. Countering and offsetting security threats therefore means tackling the challenges originating at home. The task for the Baltic states is to enhance democratic governance domestically by eliminating corruption, building their own strong and free media environment and civil organizations as well as an independent, fair and efficient legal system.</p>

          <heading>Setbacks in the Baltic Transition since 2004</heading>
          <p>The three Baltic states are still undergoing the transition to improved democratic governance, with each of these countries continuing to experience setbacks. The next section illuminates transitional challenges that affect positive trends in terms of tackling corruption, building a free, strong media environment and civil society, as well as a sound legal system and institutions.</p>
          <p>Since the restoration of independence, the Baltic states have undergone political consolidation, but setbacks and their consequent effect on democratic transition continue to be felt to the present day (Megem and Rekada, 2014). In Latvia, for example, the presence of three notable oligarchs—Aivars Lembergs, Andris Šķēle and Ainārs Šlesers—has served as a conduit for Russian transit, cargo and banking-sector interests (and consequently corruption) in Latvian politics until this day. Political and business interests have been significantly intertwined in Latvia. Considering the argument that Slavic groups favour closer ties with Russia anyway, the presence of such oligarchs indicates that Latvian political elites are not necessarily always positioned against Russian influence either.</p>
          <p>The presence of such oligarchs, who favour closer business ties with Russia, carries direct implications for the Latvian political system. For example, Šlesers (still a member of the Latvian Parliament) not only sponsored his own political groups and those of his partners, but received donations from the other two, Lembergs and Šķēle. These financial contributions, which were not completely transparent, originated from financial institutions and business ventures that were closely tied to Russia, or allegedly even criminal circles (Kuris, 2016). The presence of such oligarchs, with business ties with Russia, has a clear, direct and negative effect on the Latvian political fabric. This type of business-political management is corrupt, not fully transparent, and deleterious to sound democratic governance.</p>
          <p>Moreover, their presence bears implications for the Latvian legal system. The demands on its capacity due to corruption and attempts to exert political influence over the judiciary has made it difficult to ensure oligarchs are held accountable in cases of corruption. For example, Lembergs spent considerable time in Latvian courts attempting to prove his innocence in front of prosecutors and substantial evidence apparently revealing corruption on a large-scale. The Latvian court system was unable to resolve the issue for many years. At the end of 2019, however, to hold corrupt oligarchs accountable for their actions against a key European ally, the USA sanctioned Lembergs for exerting control over institutions and entities by means of political parties and corrupt politicians for his own economic gain (Reuters, 2019).</p>
          <p>Apart from binding together political and economic interests, with implications for corruption levels and an adverse impact on legal systems, there has been a restless willingness to control public opinion for political gain. Media freedoms, quality journalism and investigative reporting have been held hostage to economic interests, as seen vividly in the case with Latvia. Following the dramatic impact of the 2008 economic crisis on advertising markets in the Baltic countries, the Swedish-based company Bonnier decided to close its business in Latvia in 2009 and sell one of the country’s largest publishers of press dailies, the Diena Group, to the UK’s Rowland family, which in turn sold 51% of the shares to Latvian businessman Viesturs Koziols, who held ties to the three oligarchs. Meanwhile, TV market leader LNT and regional channel TV5 were sold to local media entrepreneur Andrejs Ēķis (Stetka, 2012). Local ownership of such media outlets creates risks in terms of targeted media campaigns, poor reporting and a lack of transparency. In many cases a few influential media groups have control over not just one Baltic state, but have the ability to support Russian strategic interests and business ventures in all three Baltic states simultaneously.</p>
          <p>In many cases media activities have been organized around specific regional interest groups in each of the Baltic states. For example, the business of Pirmais Baltijas Kanals (PBK—the First Baltic Channel), a Russian-language TV broadcaster) is relatively undeveloped in Lithuania, as only around 5% of the population there are ethnic Russian. The business is much bigger in Estonia, where PBK even received a commission from Tallinn’s City Council worth almost €500,000 (Springe, 2012). The result of such long-term broadcasting in Russian, which has been accused of supporting Kremlin narratives and Russia’s foreign and strategic interests and vision, is of particular relevance for Estonia’s Russian-speaking population.</p>
          <p>For example, since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine in 2014, Russia has flooded state-backed Russian-language news broadcasts—widely available in Estonia—with anti-Ukraine propaganda. In a 2022 discussion on a popular Facebook group called Tallintsi (Tallinn Residents) the front line Ukrainian town of Sumi was described as `a nest of fascists’, while another post demanded that Ukrainian refugees be `sent home’ (Duxbury, 2022). Such instances make it more difficult for the Estonian Government to deliver military and social support to Ukraine during the war, if democratic consensus and, therefore, political support domestically is suffering.</p>
          <p>Similar instances can be found in Latvia or Lithuania. Moreover, even exiled Russian opposition media outlets are not necessarily an exception. For example, after receiving permission to broadcast from Latvia, one of the few independent Russian TV channels, Dozhd (TV Rain) was fined and subsequently banned by the Latvian media regulator. Several reasons were identified, but they included the displaying of a map that labelled Crimea as Russian territory, and references to Russian forces as `our army’ (Camut, 2023).</p>
          <p>
      In multiple cases at the local level the weak media environment allows for a lack of transparency and, as a result, corruption. In Estonia’s Russian-speaking Kohtla-Järve region businessmen such as Nikolai Ossipenko have not only abused their own local media outlets (such as 
      <i>Panorama</i>
      ), but have also wielded power over the local municipality, decisions and, as a result, procurements. The eastern town of Kohtla-Järve has been the centre of a complex intermingling of political power, influence and business for decades, under the control of former mayor and businessman Ossipenko (ERR News, 2022). If the situation with Kohtla-Järve and media freedom can be regarded as highly negative, then conversely there are other cases that have allowed corruption at the local level to be unveiled, as in Lithuania’s Klaipėda region.
    </p>
          <p>
      A local media outlet there, 
      <i>Atvira Klaipėda,</i>
       wrote about local oligarch Igiri Udovitsky’s influence over the work of the Klaipėda municipality, and his lasting influence over local elections and interests groups. Udovitsky, the representative of Belarusian pot-ash producer Belaruskalij in Lithuania, and the owner of a joint venture with Belaruskalij, reportedly tried to use EU’s General Data Protection Regulation to disguise information pertaining to procurements and beneficiaries, his company and connections inside the local government. The local media, in co-operation with the Lithuanian public broadcaster, uncovered evidence of corruption.
    </p>
          <p>The united position of this local media outlet and the Lithuanian public broadcaster received strong public support to reveal the beneficiaries of future public procurement and thus allow increased transparency, less corrupt governance and increased public trust in local government (Jašinskienė, 2021). Once Lithuanian journalists united on this issue, both the law and the courts were compelled to act.</p>
          <p>It is not enough to limit and control media information. There is a need for high quality, independent content. In Lithuania (as in Latvia or Estonia), public media is financed from the state budget and must deliver unbiased, quality information. As Lietuvos Nacionalinis Radijas ir Televizij (LRT—Lithuanian National Radio and Television) does not receive revenue from selling advertising to the private sector, the independent media group must receive public finance. This financing model causes significant tensions between the national broadcaster and private media outlets, and between private and public media sectors more broadly. When public broadcasters raise salaries to enhance journalistic quality, the private sector loses competitiveness, the best journalists and, thus, quality content. Competition for quality reporting drops. Moreover, the improved financing and buildup of a strong public broadcaster (which on an annual basis depends on the financial resources assigned by the Lithuanian Parliament, the Seimas) creates dependency, which can lead to the public broadcasting of programmes and content that is in alignment with the interests of political groups (Žuolytė, 2021).</p>
          <p>The independence of the public broadcaster has been increasingly challenged by political groups through the LRT administration and management. There have even been opposition reports and complaints to institutions in Lithuania such as the Constitutional Court (Andrukaitytė, 2023). The nomination of the management of the public broadcaster is followed by heated political debates on the selection, independence and nomination of the candidates by the LRT Council. The reason for such discussions is the reported long-term interest (particularly between 2016 and 2020) of the political majority in the Lithuanian Parliament in access to the content and priorities of the national public broadcaster and in the ability to seek political influence over independent media content.</p>

          <heading>Conclusion</heading>
          <p>If EU and NATO membership for Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has provided security benefits (guaranteed by the transatlantic security alliance) and socioeconomic security (provided through access to the EU’s market and institutions), then full security remains dependent on a sound democratic transition. The case with Ukraine, where corruption, a lack of transparency and institutions evolving from the competing political influence of pro-Russian and pro-Western political groups has led to the occupation of Crimea and hybrid war since 2014, and open warfare against the pro-Western regime in Kyiv since early 2022, is the most prominent example—and a warning for the Baltic states.</p>
          <p>Strong democratic consensus depends on social cohesion and strong links between the political elites and society, but as statistical analysis suggests, corruption, lack of transparency (due to weak media freedoms and civil society) and corrupt legal systems undermine democratic transition. These conditions create fault lines between political elites and society, which then creates space for Russian political rhetoric inside the Baltic states.</p>
          <p>Russia seeks to pursue a narrative of failure for the Baltic states, presenting them as dependent on the Russian market and, conversely, presenting the Kremlin as the custodian of conservative values and the rights of the Russian-speaking world (Ruskij Mir). Geopolitically, Moscow views the former Soviet/Empire territories as its special zone of interest and influence. If NATO security guarantees prevent direct military action against the Baltic states, then the abundance of resources inside Russia facilitates an unprecedented Russian political presence not only inside each of the Baltic states, but more broadly.</p>
          <p>In terms of the Baltic states, through individuals and groups favouring closer business and political ties with Russia, there is the possibility to wield unprecedented political power not only in each Baltic country, but throughout the whole region. The preventative for such influence is an absence of corruption, a strong and independent media, and a sound civil society and court systems. Multiple cases within each of the Baltic states demonstrate significant setbacks with the democratic transition. These transitional setbacks render the Baltic states, both individually and together, intrinsically vulnerable and sensitive.</p>
          <p>For all democracies, especially small ones, the challenge is the same, be it Taiwan or Lithuania. Former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told an audience in the Taiwanese capital Taipei that although the war in Ukraine demonstrated that democracies should stand together, `lies and disinformation spread by “wicked” local actors poses the greater threat to democracy than [that] from external threats such as authoritarian nations’ (Bourke, 2023). The conclusion, then, is that the greatest challenge for the Baltic states resides within, and is the successful transition to stronger democratic regimes.</p>
