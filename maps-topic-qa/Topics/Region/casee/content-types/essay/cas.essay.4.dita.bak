     <p id="CAS.ESSAY.4.P1">This essay discusses Greece’s relationship with its neighbourhood to the north (Balkans) and to the east (Turkey—known as Türkiye from mid-2022, and the Eastern Mediterranean), and how this has evolved through time. It begins with a brief historical presentation of Greek foreign policy during the 19th and 20th centuries, then examines the more recent regional environment, and concludes with the country’s current regional position in the context of increasing geopolitical and geoeconomic challenges.</p>
     <gen-section id="CAS.ESSAY.4.1" print-style="COLUMN" sllink="SLSDOC" slsdocrf="GEN-SECTREF">
          <heading>From the Greek War of Independence to the `Asia Minor Disaster’, 1821-1922</heading>
          <p id="CAS.ESSAY.4.P2">The Greek state was created in the early 19th century following a war of liberation against the Ottoman Empire, with the help of the European Great Powers, during 1821-29. The defining feature of Greek foreign policy for almost a century after independence was the desire to expand the Greek border, in the context of a competitive Balkan environment and the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire. The existence of many Greek-speaking Christians abroad led to the official adoption of the state-sponsored nationalist aspiration of a Greater Greece, the `Megali Idea’ (`Great Idea’), a project that dominated Greek internal and external politics for a century, and led to the gradual expansion of Greek territory, but also to some considerable setbacks.</p>
          <p id="CAS.ESSAY.4.P3">During the course of this period Greece pursued a policy of nation building by increasing its size from the original `old Greece’ (the Peloponnese, Rumeli and the Cyclades), to incorporate the Ionian islands in 1864, Thessaly and parts of Epirus in 1881, and in 1912-13, following the Balkan wars, Crete, part of Macedonia, a further part of Epirus and the islands of the north-east Aegean (the Dodecanese were acquired from Italy in 1947). This territorial expansion involved fierce regional and international battles, unstable relations with neighbouring countries, and a Western-orientated state-building process.</p>
          <p id="CAS.ESSAY.4.P4">Until the mid-19th century the Greeks had considered themselves best suited to lead the rest of the Christian populations in the Balkans. They regarded the Balkans as the space for their `civilizing mission’, which took the form of the propagation and dissemination of the Greek language, the ideals of Ancient Greece and Orthodox Christianity. The Crimean War (1853-56) was a turning point in the country’s relations with the Balkans, as well as with the three `Protecting Powers’, the United Kingdom, France and Russia. Russia, despite having initially projected itself as the champion of all the Orthodox Christians of the East and having supported them in their fight against the rule of the Muslim Ottomans, eventually reserved its support mainly for the Slavs of the region and adopted Bulgaria and Serbia as its favoured new states. This shift contributed to a growing Slavophobia affecting Greek foreign relations (particularly against the southern expansion of Bulgaria), which was exacerbated by the establishment, in 1870, by Ottoman imperial decree, of a Bulgarian national church, the Bulgarian Exarchate, as a splinter of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, and a major source of Bulgarian nationalism. The Bulgarian national `awakening’ was contrary to Greek national interests, since Bulgarian nationalists claimed for themselves Macedonia and Thrace, which Greece considered to be both `Greek historical lands’ and safe national preserves.</p>
          <p id="CAS.ESSAY.4.P5">Owing to its ethnically mixed population and its location at the heart of the southern Balkans, Macedonia became a major area of contention between Greece and Bulgaria. The region was riven by bitter struggles, not just at official state or religious levels, but most intensely at the local level, with guerrilla wars between Greeks and Bulgarians resulting in massacres and population purges. Between 1904 and 1908 a fierce guerrilla war (widely referred to by Greeks as the `Struggle for Macedonia’) was waged, as Greek and Bulgarian armed groups tried to gain territory, terrorizing local peasants into declaring themselves `Greeks’ or `Bulgarians’. In the First Balkan War of 1912 the Balkan independent countries fought together, and proved victorious, against the Ottoman Empire. However, the Balkan alliance of Bulgaria, Greece, Montenegro and Serbia was short-lived, and in 1913 there was a Second Balkan War, in which Greece and Serbia joined forces against Bulgaria and succeeded in dividing Macedonia at the expense of Bulgaria.</p>
          <p>During the First World War—a `third Balkan war’ for the countries in the region, since they became allied with opposing large powers (Bulgaria and Turkey with the Central Powers of Austria-Hungary and Germany; Serbia and Romania with the Entente Powers of France, Russia and the UK)—Greece suffered a deep `national schism’ over the question of the country’s international alignment. At the time, the country was divided between the anti-monarchist followers of the political leader Eleftherios Venizelos, who supported the Entente Powers, and the Royalists of King Konstantinos (Constantine) I, who implicitly supported Germany but advocated neutrality in the war. Relations between the two sides deteriorated to such a degree that in October 1916 Venizelos established a rival Government in Thessaloniki, and in June 1917, following his assumption of the national premiership and the King’s abdication, brought the country to the side of France and the UK when Greece entered the war as an ally of the Entente Powers. Greece sought to reap the benefits of its support for the Allied cause during the Versailles peace conference convened in France in 1919, and claimed as reward more territories from the disintegrating Ottoman Empire. Under the Treaty of Sèvres, Greece acquired Western and Eastern Thrace, the islands in the north-western Aegean, and a mandate to administer the greater Smyrna area of Asia Minor (later İzmir, Turkey), where a large population of Greeks had lived for centuries. Greek forces subsequently initiated a military operation to destroy Turkish resistance in Anatolia.</p>
          <p>The electoral defeat of Venizelos in November 1920 brought royalist politicians to power in Greece, who continued the military campaign in Anatolia against the forces of Mustafa Kemal (Atatürk). The Greek advance foundered in Ankara, in central Anatolia, and the Turkish offensive defeated the Greek army and brought about the wholesale eviction of the Greek presence in Anatolia. Under the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923, Greece lost some of its recently acquired territories, including Smyrna, Eastern Thrace, and the islands of Imbros and Tenedos. To prevent any further territorial claims, both Greece and Turkey engaged in an `exchange of populations’, thereby marking the end of a Greek presence in Anatolia, as well as of a Turkish population in the territories of the Greek state (with a few remaining Greeks in İstanbul, Turkey, and Turks in Western Thrace). The so-called `Asia Minor Catastrophe’ marked the end of Greek irredentism, bringing 1.4m. Greek refugees within the boundaries of Greece, then a country of only 5m. people. The legacy of this event was a human disaster for Greece and a victory for the new Republic of Turkey, the latter consolidating the new state in the land of Anatolia. From an international security perspective, the `Asia Minor Catastrophe’ brought an end to military campaigns between Greece and Turkey, and both countries went about their respective state projects of national integration of refugees. Greece had to adapt, with a massive number of refugees who, because of their Orthodox Christian identity, were obliged to resettle in Greek territory. </p>

          <heading>From 1922 until the End of the 20th Century</heading>
          <p id="CAS.ESSAY.4.P6">In the post-1922 environment, Greek governments made a concerted effort to consolidate recent territorial acquisitions in Epirus, Macedonia and Western Thrace and to manage the massive influx of population. In the new, post-Ottoman era the Balkans continued to preoccupy Greece’s foreign policy, and there were some instances of regional unity and Balkan co-operation, with a series of intergovernmental conferences and the establishment of the Balkan Entente by Greece, Romania, Turkey and Yugoslavia in 1934. During the Second World War Greece suffered a harsh Nazi German occupation, experiencing a substantial death toll, famine and hardship. During the same period the country developed resistance movements against the occupying German forces, both of the communist left and the nationalist right. The increasing influence of the left within Greece, combined with the emergence of deep international ideological divisions in the aftermath of the Second World War, led to a protracted civil war in Greece.</p>
          <p id="CAS.ESSAY.4.P7">The civil war of 1944-49 split Greece into two camps: the Western-backed forces led by the Greek Government and the communist forces led by the Kommunistiko Komma Elladas (KKE—Communist Party of Greece). During the civil war the Greek communists received support from the communist regimes of the Balkans and particularly from Yugoslavia, while the Government of Greece received military, economic and political support from the USA, the latter contributing to the ultimate victory of the right-wing forces in 1949. The Greek civil war led to a wave of refugees fleeing to Eastern Europe, and by 1949 an estimated 100,000 people, many of them children, had been taken to the eastern bloc—Yugoslavia, Albania, Poland, Romania and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR).</p>
          <p>During the period following the Second World War, the economic reconstruction of Europe and the decline in British influence resulted in substantial US intervention in Greek politics, which was unequivocal in its support for an anti-communist, exclusionary state, with a strong role attributed to the monarchy, the military and the parliamentary right, at the expense of the more liberal and left-wing forces, leading eventually to the imposition of a seven-year dictatorship between 1967 and 1974. After the fall of the military regime, Greece underwent a successful and irreversible transition to democracy, adopting a new Constitution, abolishing the monarchy, opening up its party system and placing the military firmly under civilian rule. Henceforth, the country became a consolidated democracy with a competitive party system, and a growing economy, anchored in the integrating context of the European Union (EU).</p>
          <p id="CAS.ESSAY.4.P8">In the foreign policy domain, the Cold War years solidified the ideological drift of Greece from the rest of the Balkans, with Greece firmly on the Western liberal side and the Balkan states under communist leaderships. The country became a member of major Western international organizations, such as the Council of Europe in 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1952, and an associate country of the European Economic Community in 1961, thus drifting further apart from its communist neighbours in the Balkans, some of which became members of the rival defence alliance known as the Warsaw Pact and the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA), while others, like Yugoslavia, followed their own more independent international course between the two Cold War sides. However, this ideological and political divide did not lead to military confrontation, with Greece co-existing peacefully with its northern neighbours and stability in the region that lasted for four decades. Relations between Greece and the Balkans became more cordial under the Governments of Konstantinos Karamanlis (1974-80) and Andreas Papandreou (1981-89). While this signalled a period of rapprochement with Bulgaria, Romania and Yugoslavia, the new course of diplomatic re-engagement failed to contribute to substantially deeper economic or societal ties, as Greece’s agenda was driven, in the main, by the opportunities and challenges of European integration, with the country becoming a full member state of the European Community (EC, later the EU) in 1981.</p>
          <p>For Greece, the main security threat came from within the Western military alliance, namely from Turkey, with Cyprus at the centre of discord between the two countries from the 1950s, and the emergence of territorial disputes in the Aegean during the 1970s that continued to trouble bilateral relations in subsequent years. After the 1974 Turkish invasion of the north of Cyprus (following a short-lived military coup by the Greek military regime on the island), Greek-Turkish relations were dominated by disputes over the Aegean, including the demarcation of the continental shelf and territorial waters, the border and control of airspace for both civil and military purposes, and the militarization of the Greek islands near the Turkish border. Greece had severe reservations about Turkey becoming a member of the EU as long as the issue of the division of Cyprus and the bilateral Aegean disputes were not addressed. In 1996 Greece and Turkey came to the brink of war, owing to conflicting claims of sovereignty over the islet of Imia (Kardak in Turkish) in the Aegean.</p>
          <p>The demise of communist rule in the Balkans brought for Greece many opportunities for regional re-engagement within a more united Europe. At the end of the Cold War Greece was the most stable democracy, the most prosperous economy and the only country in the region to enjoy membership of all major Western international organizations. Greece’s regional post-communist re-engagement took place amid the violent disintegration of Yugoslavia, which revived memories of nationalist competition and territorial revisionism in the Balkans, and with the region becoming the epicentre of insecurity in Europe. For Greece, in particular, this regional instability brought the Macedonian issue back to the fore of domestic politics. Along with other Yugoslav republics—Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina—the hitherto Yugoslav republic of Macedonia became independent in 1991, giving rise to strong Greek objections over the new state’s constitutional name (the Republic of Macedonia). As part of its state-building process, the latter increasingly competed with Greece over the appropriation of the ancient Macedonian past under Alexander the Great. The Greek authorities argued that ancient Macedonia was exclusively part of Greece’s heritage, and `Macedonia’ was a geographical term delineating an area that included a large part of northern Greece, and expressed fears that a newly independent country under that name might harbour ambitions of future territorial expansion. Following Greek objections and unsuccessful initial attempts for a compromise solution, in April 1993 the country was admitted to the United Nations (UN) under an interim designation pending a resolution of the issue. Aside from that dispute, Greece embarked on the establishment of close economic and political relations with all the Balkan states, and achieved a rapprochement with Turkey in 1999, lifting its objections to Turkey’s official EU candidate member status.</p>

          <heading>Greece into the 21st Century</heading>
          <p>The advent of the new century appeared to bring promising prospects for Greece’s regional presence. Benefiting from a growing economy, during the first decade Greece become a member of the eurozone, undertook major infrastructural projects at home, organized a successful 2004 Summer Olympic Games in Athens and implemented a consistently co-operative regional approach under the aegis of the EU. Although a smaller player in the context of the EU, Greece’s economic influence in the Balkans, with a much higher gross domestic product (GDP) per head and a better-functioning private economy than other countries, resulted in it becoming a chief source of foreign direct investment (FDI) and a major trading partner for the region. Greek companies in sectors such as banking, food processing, manufacturing, retail and telecommunications established large-scale operations in most Balkan states. In addition, Greece became an advocate of the region’s orientation towards the EU, culminating in an agreement committing to the European integration of the Balkans at a summit in Thessaloniki, during Greece’s Presidency of the Council of the EU in January-June 2003.</p>

          <heading>Post-2008 Economic Crisis</heading>
          <p>The strong regional presence of Greece suffered a reverse in 2008 when the country experienced the impact of the global financial crisis on an unprecedented scale, with a deep recession which lasted for almost 10 years, resulting in the loss of one-quarter of the country’s GDP, a return to pre-2000 economic levels, unemployment reaching 27.8% (with youth unemployment of 58.3%) in 2013 and an ever-increasing debt burden, which rose to an all-time high of 181.2% of GDP in 2018. The country’s near-bankrupt economy, which threatened to precipitate the collapse of the wider eurozone economy, was sustained by consecutive rescue packages from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the EU, accompanied by strict conditionality and severe austerity. The Greek economy came to the verge of collapse in early 2010, and again in mid-2012 and upon the country’s near exit from the eurozone in mid-2015. By 2018, following a series of stringent austerity measures, the Greek economy had begun to demonstrate some low positive growth, primary surpluses and a slow decline in unemployment. On 20 August of that year Greece officially exited the third bailout programme, but continued to face a prolonged and difficult post-bailout transition to economic recovery. </p>
          <p>As with many other areas of government policy, the Greek economic depression had a large impact on the country’s foreign policy, resulting in the withdrawal of many of its financial and business operations in the region. However, in a major breakthrough, on 12 June 2018 the Greek and Macedonian Governments signed the Prespa agreement, which ended the bilateral name dispute and provided for the adoption of a new name, the `Republic of North Macedonia’. The resolution, which was acclaimed by the international community, allowed the renamed North Macedonia to join NATO and ended Greece’s opposition to the country’s start of accession talks with the EU.</p>
          <p>During the difficult years of economic crisis, Greece strengthened its links further afield in the economies of the People’s Republic of China, Israel, and in the Middle East. China, which had an interest in Greece that pre-dated the years of crisis, viewed Greece as an important gateway to Europe, with its strategic maritime and land route between the Suez Canal, the Balkan peninsula and Europe. It therefore proceeded with the acquisition of a majority stake in the port of Piraeus, which became one of the fastest expanding terminals in Europe, and with increasing investment in the transport, telecommunications and energy sectors. Finally, in the Middle East relations with Israel improved significantly in the fields of energy, economy and tourism, as did relations with Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).</p>

          <heading>Refugee Crisis</heading>
          <p>During the turbulent years of Greece’s economic calamity, another crisis struck the country’s vulnerable structures. A large-scale influx of refugees brought Greece to the forefront of Europe’s attention once again. As the main entry point from South-Eastern Europe to the rest of Europe and the Schengen area of free movement, Greece was severely affected by a mass arrival of refugees from Turkey, predominantly from the Syrian Arab Republic, but also comprising economic migrants from sub-Saharan Africa, Pakistan and Afghanistan, all seeking to settle in Western Europe. More than 1m. refugees and migrants crossed into Europe by means of the Greek islands adjacent to Turkey during 2015, placing additional strain on the economically beleaguered country, while precipitating a wider crisis in Europe as countries struggled to cope with the influx, and creating divisions within the EU over how to address the resettlement of refugees.</p>
          <p>Confronted with a humanitarian disaster and a wider crisis among its member states, the EU was compelled to reach an agreement with Turkey in March 2016, which provided funds of some €6,000m. towards the humanitarian needs of refugees in that country and introduced controls against the illegal trafficking of migrants through the Aegean Sea. Although the deal managed to curb the refugee flows substantially, the refugee issue became the central feature of EU-Turkish relations, the latter gradually deteriorating in the context of rising authoritarianism under Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, his foreign policy in Syria and his close relations with the Russian Federation. </p>
          <p>On 29 February 2020 Erdoğan, for reasons of Turkey’s own geopolitical considerations, once again declared the frontier to Europe `open’, prompting thousands of migrants in Turkey to travel to its land border with north-eastern Greece along the Evros (Maritsa) River. In response to the sudden decision by Turkey to bring migrants to the Greek border, the Greek authorities increased security in the border area, with the support of the EU, to prevent large numbers crossing into the country. Both Greece and the EU have faced criticism from humanitarian non-governmental organizations for using illegal practices to repel migrants at the land and sea borders, but mostly over the conditions of the refugee camps on the islands. The Evros continued to be one of the main land entry points for irregular migration into the EU, compelling the Nea Dimokratia (ND—New Democracy) Government to increase its security personnel and to expand the construction of a wall to stem the influx of migrants. The construction of the wall had already started in 2012, when the Greek authorities built the first 12.5-km stretch of steel fence north-east of the town of Orestiada to seal off the Turkish enclave around Karaağaç. The project cost some US&#160;$3.3m. and drew criticism from international human rights organizations and EU officials. More recently, Greece added some 25.5 km to the border fence, in the area of Feres. The ND Government’s agenda envisaged the installation of a 140 km fence along the entire length of the Greek-Turkish border in Thrace, the employment of additional police officers and the installation of electronic surveillance systems.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, thousands of refugees remained in reception centres across the border islands of Chios, Lesbos, Leros, Kos and Samos. With refugees unable to leave the islands until their asylum requests were processed, Greece’s overburdened system was incapable of coping with the rising number of pending applications. In September 2020 a fire destroyed the Moria refugee camp on Lesbos, the largest camp in Europe, which had originally been designed to house some 3,000 people, yet was holding around 13,000 in extremely overcrowded and unhygienic conditions, and had consequently become a symbol of Europe’s failed refugee practices. Those refugees were relocated to another part of the island and the Government committed to the construction of new camps with better living conditions.</p>
          <p>A substantial increase in flows of migrants to Europe via the Mediterranean was recorded during the first half of 2023, the majority arriving in Italy, but with increased numbers crossing to Greece. On 14 June a fishing vessel capsized in waters near the southern coastal town of Pylos in the Peloponnese, leaving hundreds dead and missing. This represented one of the largest migrant tragedies in the Mediterranean in recent years. The UN has registered more than 20,000 deaths and disappearances in the central Mediterranean since 2014, making it the most dangerous migrant crossing in the world.</p>

          <heading>Greek-Turkish Tensions</heading>
          <p>The sensitive refugee issue soured relations between Greece and Turkey but was not the only source of conflict and, despite more than a decade of the post-1999 rapprochement between the two countries, their bilateral ties deteriorated sharply, especially in the period after the failed coup against Erdoğan in Turkey in July 2016. Among the first disputes that contributed to the deteriorating climate was dissent between the two countries over eight Turkish soldiers, who shortly after the coup attempt landed at Alexandroupolis airport, in north-eastern Greece, seeking asylum. Turkey repeatedly requested their extradition, which the Greek Supreme Court refused, on the grounds that their personal safety would be at risk under Erdoğan’s regime.</p>
          <p>With relations becoming more tense, historic neo-Ottoman contestations by Turkey with regard to the Aegean were revived, including claims by Turkish politicians who publicly disputed Greece’s sovereignty over a number of islands in the eastern Aegean, and Erdoğan’s assertion that the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne was a defeat for Turkey since it `gave away’ islands to Greece. The bilateral strains were worsened by increased military activity in the Aegean, and what Greeks condemned as violations of Greek airspace and naval incursions into Greek waters by Turkish research vessels. Under the UN’s Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), every state has the right to establish the breadth of its territorial sea up to a limit of 12 nautical miles (22 km). Turkey was not a signatory to the UNCLOS, and did not accept the right of the Aegean islands to the distance of 12 nautical miles, threatening Greece with military action should it exercise its rights under the UNCLOS. Both countries currently claim six nautical miles of territorial waters in the Aegean, and 12 nautical miles off their other shores. A related dispute concerns sovereign rights to exploit undersea hydrocarbon resources and the right of the Greek islands to an Exclusive Economic Zone.</p>
          <p>The disagreements between Greece and Turkey extended beyond the Aegean to the eastern Mediterranean region, where Turkey opposed vehemently any efforts at exploratory oil and gas drilling off the coast of Cyprus, within the latter’s exclusive economic zone, threatening to take military action against Greek Cypriots for acting `unilaterally’. This followed the failure of a further round of negotiations in 2017 on the reunification of Cyprus, amid mutual recriminations. Greece, a supporter of a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation in Cyprus, focused its attention on the withdrawal of Turkish forces from the north of the island and the abolition of the 1960 guarantor system (which had awarded guarantor powers to Greece, Turkey and the UK upon Cyprus’s independence from the UK), and its replacement with an alternative multilateral arrangement. Renewed negotiations in April 2021 in Geneva, Switzerland, under the auspices of the UN, failed to reach any agreement, with both the `Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus’ and Turkey, for the first time, seeking officially a two-state solution.</p>
          <p>Relations with Turkey were strained even further following the signing of a memorandum of understanding by Turkey and the UN-recognized Government of Libya in November 2019 on the demarcation of an exclusive economic zone in the Mediterranean, which was rejected by Greece as a violation of its territorial rights around the island of Crete. In order to counter Turkish influence in the Eastern Mediterranean region, Greece strengthened its co-operation with Cyprus and Israel by signing a trilateral agreement on the construction of a 1,900-km pipeline, at a cost of some €6,000m., in January 2020, which was to transport natural gas from the eastern Mediterranean to Europe. In addition, as a direct response to the Turkish-Libyan maritime agreement, Greece signed similar agreements with Italy in June and with Egypt in August. On 3 October 2022 the Turkish Government signed a follow-up preliminary agreement with Libya to explore for oil and gas off the Libyan coast, without specifying whether the surveys would take place in waters south of Greece. In effect, Libya became an involved third party in the bilateral Greco-Turkish dispute, and relations between the Greek and Libyan Governments suffered as a result. To the west, in late 2020 Greece sought to improve maritime relations with Albania by agreeing to refer a 10-year maritime border dispute to the International Court of Justice (ICJ). In addition, in January 2021 the Government announced the extension of its territorial waters in the Ionian Sea from six to 12 nautical miles, an act that, if repeated in the Aegean, would be considered by Turkey as grounds for declaration of war.</p>
          <p>The positions of the two states remained far apart. Greece accused Turkey of behaving like a neo-Ottoman revisionist power in the region, after it adopted an expansionist `blue homeland’ agenda—an unofficial geopolitical concept, originating with the aspirations of certain Turkish naval officers during the 2000s, but which had been revived following the failed 2016 coup attempt against Erdoğan—occasionally using maps depicting one-half of the Aegean as belonging to Turkey. Turkey, for its part, accused Greece of maximalist positions in delimiting maritime boundaries and turning the Aegean into a `Greek lake’, and declared that it was determined to defend its rights as a maritime power in the Eastern Mediterranean. Greece insists that bilateral talks should focus only on the delimitation of the continental shelf, with any unresolved issues being referred to the ICJ in The Hague. The Turkish perspective seeks to include the issues of territorial waters, `grey zones’ in the Aegean and the demilitarization of Greece’s Eastern Aegean islands, and demands that disputes be considered together in a balanced process of negotiation.</p>
          <p>With the aim of countering Turkey’s increasing military power, Greece proceeded with the procurement of military purchases, notably from its most vociferous European supporter, France, and employed its diplomatic capital—membership of the EU, its close relationship with the USA, as well as relations in the Middle East—to contain Turkey’s regional influence. On 11 February 2021 Greece hosted a summit, known as the Friendship Forum, in the Greek capital, Athens, which was attended by the foreign ministers of Egypt, Cyprus, and the Gulf states of Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the UAE (and with remote participation by the French Minister of Foreign Affairs), with the stated aim of deepening co-operation and contributing to peace and security in the region. Greece was gradually prioritizing its neighbourhood policy in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East through a series of diplomatic actions and bilateral partnerships with emphasis on security and defence.</p>
          <p>In September 2021 Greece signed a major defence agreement, which included commitments to purchase French warships worth at least €3,000m., as well as a clause on mutual defence assistance. In Greece the agreement was seen as a long overdue modernization of its armed forces, which had totally stagnated during the period of the country’s economic crisis. In 2018 the country’s military budget was just €3,750m., compared with €7,240m. in 2008. However, in 2019 and 2020 Greece increased its spending, and it continued to do so: defence expenditure was €6,580m. in 2021, compared with €4,400m. in 2020.</p>
          <p>
      Greece’s ND Government also renewed a defence agreement with the USA that granted US forces open-ended access to four strategic military bases in Greece. An upgraded Mutual Defence Cooperation Agreement was signed in October 2021, allowing the US military to operate and train at four military bases, including one in the northern city port of Alexandroupolis, very near the Turkish land border. Indeed, the US vehicle carrier 
      <i>ARC Endurance</i>
       arrived in Alexandroupolis in June 2022 for the `largest transfer of military equipment’ ever to be handled by the port, reflecting its rising strategic significance in relation to the war in Ukraine (see 
      <i>The Impact of the War in Ukraine on Greece’s Foreign Policy</i>
      ). The US-Greek military partnership also provided in its armament programme for the upgrade and expansion of the naval base at Souda Bay in Crete, the aim being gradually to transform this traditionally important port into a permanent base for part of the Greek Navy, to facilitate rapid, more direct access to the Eastern Mediterranean, with the full support of the USA. The US tilt towards Greece and the emphasis on the port of Alexandroupolis led to Turkish opprobrium directed at both Greece and the USA.

          <p>In mid-May 2022 Greek premier Kyriakos Mitsotakis made a historic address to a joint session of the US Congress, the first by a Greek leader, in which he made reference to Turkey’s revisionist foreign policy agenda. In his speech, he indirectly warned Congress against selling military hardware to Turkey, claiming that the move could provoke new instability in the Eastern Mediterranean. This statement antagonized Turkish President Erdoğan, who announced that he no longer recognized the Prime Minister of Greece and would refuse to meet him at a planned summit.</p>
          <p>Amid this tense bilateral climate, relations took an unexpected positive turn following the major earthquake that affected Turkey on 6 February 2023. Greece’s immediate pledges of support and assistance to those affected by the earthquake was received very positively by the Turkish Government, easing tensions and potentially creating space for some reparation of relations between the two countries. Following that, the foreign and defence ministers of the two countries met in a more conducive environment, expressing support for improved relations and the building of a positive agenda, including energy co-operation, further bilateral security exploratory talks and confidence-building measures. Unlike in the recent past, neither Government made use of nationalist rhetoric with respect to the other in an effort to increase their popularity ahead of elections in May, when both Erdoğan and Mitsotakis were seeking re-election.</p>

          <heading>The Impact of the War in Ukraine on Greece’s Foreign Policy</heading>
          <p>Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, Greece was one of the first EU countries to announce that it would send arms to assist Ukraine in repelling the offensive. The decision came a day after Russian air strikes had killed at least 10 ethnic Greeks, members of a 150,000-member community dating back to the 18th century, near Ukraine’s port of Mariupol. While the shipments—mostly rifles and anti-tank missiles—were hardly enough to alter the balance of the war, they were symbolic domestically. In a matter of days, Prime Minister Mitsotakis had dramatically reversed Greece’s longstanding aversion to becoming involved in foreign conflicts. Moreover, his move stood out in a region where other countries, like Serbia and Turkey, had adopted a different response, trying to serve as a mediator instead of an arms supplier. Nevertheless, pro-Russia sentiments remained in parts of Greece, given the centuries of religious, military, economic and cultural ties between the two countries.</p>
          <p>The impact of the war in Ukraine adversely affected Greece’s energy needs and the cost of living. It also led Greece to seek alternative energy suppliers and deals with neighbouring countries. With projects such as the Alexandroupolis Floating Storage Regasification Unit and the Gas Interconnector Greece-Bulgaria pipeline, the two countries aimed to decrease their energy dependence on Russia. In the same spirit, Romania and Greece were moving forward with major green hydrogen joint projects, with the additional support of the EU, which provided an opportunity to develop energy storage and an alternative fuel, including for the air transport industry.</p>
          <p>By mid-2023 around 100,000 Ukrainians had crossed into Greece since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, according to the Ukrainian General Consulate in Thessaloniki. They received temporary protected status, under which they were not required to apply for asylum immediately and received a residence permit much more easily than refugees from other countries. Nevertheless, many of the new arrivals moved on to another European destination, with around 22,000 Ukrainians remaining in Greece.</p>
