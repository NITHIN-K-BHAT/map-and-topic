          <heading>Christianity</heading>
          <p id="CAS.ESSAY.5.3">The Christian religion is a monotheistic faith, which has its origins in Judaism. It is based on a belief in the divinity and teachings of Jesus Christ, the Messiah or Son of God, through whom salvation (deliverance from sin and a drawing closer to God and eternal life) can be obtained. His followers established the institution of a single Church, originally based on the four leading cities of the Roman Empire: Antioch (now Antakya, Türkiye), Alexandria (now in Egypt), Rome itself (now in Vatican City and Italy) and Constantinople (now İstanbul, Türkiye). Four distinct traditions emerged: the Syrian or Jacobite Church was based in Antioch; the Coptic Church was based in Alexandria; the western, or Latin, Church in Rome (or for a period, in Avignon, now in France); and the eastern, or Greek, Orthodox Church became centred in Constantinople. Subsequent divisions resulted in the emergence of the Armenian Apostolic Church and the Nestorian Church.</p>
          <p id="CAS.ESSAY.5.4">
      The Church established the Christian calendar (denoted by the so-called `Common era’, 
      <sc>ce</sc>
      , or 
      <i>Anno Domini</i>
      , 
      <sc>ad</sc>
      ), a reckoning that is now the most widely used international system and is in official use throughout Central and South-Eastern Europe. It was the Church that preserved the use of the ancient Roman, Julian calendar, which was used in the Russian Empire until after the Bolshevik revolution of late 1917. A reformed Gregorian calendar (in normal use now) was first introduced in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII; its adoption was resisted by those countries or territories not in communion with Rome, although it was adopted by some Eastern Orthodox groupings in the 20th century. However, most Eastern Orthodox Church groups still use a version of the Julian calendar.

               <heading>The Eastern Orthodox Church</heading>
               <p id="CAS.ESSAY.5.6">
        The split (schism) in the Church that had become established in the old Roman Empire was formalized in 1054. The bishops of what had been the Latin-speaking West supported the authority of the Pope, the Roman patriarch, and the insertion of the 
        <i>filioque</i>
         clause into the standard confession of faith, the Nicene Creed. (This claimed that the Holy Spirit, a constituent part of the triune deity, was a product of both the Father and the Son—
        <i>Logos</i>
        —not merely of the Father.) The bishops of the Greek-speaking Eastern Roman Empire, dominated by the Byzantine Patriarch of Constantinople (today still regarded as the Ecumenical Patriarch), rejected this, and the religious division of Europe into East and West became formal. The Eastern Orthodox Church continued to use the Greek alphabet, but had also added to the success of its missionary work on the Byzantine borders, by introducing the Cyrillic alphabet (the invention of which is attributed to the ninth century Byzantine mission­aries SS Cyril—Constantine—and Methodius) and a Slavonic liturgy. The powerful formative influence of the Church, particularly on culture, education and national identity, is still relevant today.
      </p>
               <p id="CAS.ESSAY.5.7">The Eastern Orthodox churches have a membership of some 200m., most of them in South-Eastern Europe, Ukraine and the Russian Federation. They are not formally linked save in acknowledging the pre-eminence of the Ecumenical Patriarch (since 1991 Bartholomeos I of Constantinople and New Rome). There are some Greek Orthodox in south­ern Albania, who come under the jurisdiction of the Greek Church, and in 1996 the Estonian Church was placed under the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, despite the protests of the Moscow Patriarchate, based in Russia and the largest Orthodox ecclesiastical organization, which had been responsible for it since 1940; a rival Estonian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate was officially registered in April 2002. The main autocephalous (autonomous) Orthodox churches of South-Eastern Europe were in Bulgaria, Romania and Serbia. However, after the Serbian Orthodox Church formally granted autocephaly to the Macedonian Orthodox Church in June 2022, its legitimacy was officially recognized by the Ecumenical Patriarchate. The separate existence of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church is not officially recognized. All the countries of the region have at least some Orthodox Christians.</p>

               <heading>The Catholic Church</heading>
               <p id="CAS.ESSAY.5.10">The Catholic, Western, or Roman, Catholic Church was formerly distinguished by its use of a liturgy in Latin, which is still referred to as the Latin Rite, although, in response to the Second Vatican Council (1962-65), most services were thence­forth conducted in vernacular languages, and much of the liturgical practice and the calendar of festivals associated with the rite were also substantially amended and simplified. This Church was the Church of the Polish and the Baltic peoples, and the peoples of the Central European empires of the Germans, Austrians and Hungarians. This original divide was important in the disintegration of Yugoslavia in the 1990s: the Slovenes and Croats are predominantly Catholic, whereas the Serbs, Montenegrins and Macedonians are Eastern Orthodox.</p>
               <p id="CAS.ESSAY.5.11">
        Adherents of the Greek’ Catholic Churches in Central and South-Eastern Europe mostly use one of a number of Eastern or `Byzantine’ Rites, which are almost identical to that of the Orthodox Church, and retain their traditional liturgies and ecclesiastical organization, while priests based in parishes, but not those in monastic institutions, are permitted to have married prior to their being ordained. However, in contradistinction to the Orthodox, adherents acknowledge the primacy of the Roman pontiff, the Pope, the existence of Purgatory as a place in which, after death, souls that will eventually enter heaven are purified of sin, the doctrine of the 
        <i>filioque</i>
        , and the use of unleavened bread for communion. The Church was formed in the late 16th century, as an attempt to consolidate Polish-Lithu­anian and Catholic power in traditionally Orthodox regions of Western Ukraine and the Carpathians. A similar process took place in Transylvania (then Hungary, now Romania) at the end of the 17th century. Not all Eastern Catholics use a Byzantine Rite; there are some from non-Orthodox traditions.

               <p id="CAS.ESSAY.5.13">
        In the Reformation period of the 16th and 17th centuries some of the Western, or Catholic, Christians protested against the authority of the Roman pontiff, the Pope, and formed separate sects. Most of these groups (which subsequently became known as Protestants’, from the Latin expressions 
        <i>pro testare</i>
        —to bear witness to—and 
        <i>protestatio</i>
        —the act of protesting against—ecclesiastical practices or dogma) rejected the episcopal organization of the Church and numerous accumulations of tradition. The Lutherans and some others retain bishops in the hierarchy, but often reject the apostolic’ nature of their authority. The main denominations are: Lutheran Evangelical (who define their faith by the Augsburg Confession of 1530); Calvinists and Presbyterians (the Reformed Church of Hungary, etc.); Baptists; Pentecostalists; and Unitarians. There are also communities of Seventh-day Adventists (distinguished among Christians by their obser­vance of the Sabbath on Saturday, rather than on Sunday), Methodists and many others.

               <heading>Other Christian Churches</heading>
               <p id="CAS.ESSAY.5.15">The major split in the western Church was the Protestant defection from Rome. However, there were some precursors of this movement in the 15th century, notably the Hussites of Bohemia and Moravia (now in the Czech Republic). Several sects that sprang from the Hussite factions still exist, mainly in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, among them the Brethren churches, notably the Moravian Church, which has a significant worldwide presence, owing to its extensive missionary activity. There are communities of the Old Catholic Church in some countries of the region: this group was formed in a schism from the Roman Church, chiefly to mark disagreement with decisions taken at the First Vatican Council of 1868-70, in particular the dogmatic definition of the doctrine of papal infallibility.</p>

          <heading>Islam</heading>
          <p id="CAS.ESSAY.5.17">
      Islam means submission’ or surrender to God. It is the preferred name for the monotheistic religion founded by Muhammad (570-632 
      <sc>ce</sc>
      ), in Arabia. The un­paralleled spread of the religion in its first centuries can be attributed, in part, to the practice of holy war 
      <i>(jihad)</i>
      .
    </p>
          <p id="CAS.ESSAY.5.18">
      The Five Pillars of the practice of Islam are: the witness that there is no god but God’ 
      <i>(Allah)</i>
       and that Muhammad is His Prophet’; prayer, which takes place five times daily and includes prostration in the direction of the holy city of Makkah (Mecca—Saudi Arabia), and recitation of set verses, and is also performed in congregational worship at a mosque on Fridays, the Muslim holy day; almsgiving; fasting, which must take place during the hours of daylight for the whole of the ninth month, Ramadan; and, finally, the pilgrim­age 
      <i>(hajj)</i>
       to Mecca, which is incumbent at least once in the lifetime of a Muslim, if this is feasible. The heart of Islam is contained in the Koran, which is considered to be the very Word of God as uttered to his Prophet, and therefore to be above criticism. This authority is supplemented by various traditions 
      <i>(hadith).</i>
       To interpret the application of Islamic law 
      <i>(Sharia)</i>
       into everyday activity, four main schools of thought emerged, the main one in the region being the Hanafi. An ideal of the Islamic community 
      <i>(umma)</i>
       is that the brotherhood of Muslims is its basis and that the religion is international and beyond tribal division. However, there has not been an unchallenged Muslim leader since Muhammad, and the last of the caliphs 
      <i>(khalifas</i>
       or successors’ of Muhammad), who resided in Constantinople, had his office abolished by the Turkish Government in 1924.
    </p>
          <p id="CAS.ESSAY.5.19">
      Around one-third of European Muslims live in the Balkans. There are significant minorities of Turkish Muslims throughout the Balkan countries, and there are small Tatar communities in Poland and Lithuania. In Central and South-Eastern Europe, the main Muslim groups are either Albanians (resident in Kosovo and North Macedonia as well as Albania itself) or Slav
      
      ic Muslims, the latter mainly being the Bosnian Muslims (Bosniaks) of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Sandžak Muslims of Montenegro and Serbia, and the Pomaks of Bulgaria. Many Roma are Muslims.

      Muslims use a lunar calendar, which is about 10 days shorter than the solar calendar of the Gregorian reckoning. Islam dates its years from the 
      <i>Hijra</i>
      —the flight of the Prophet Muhammad from Mecca to Medina—so the year 
      <sc>ah</sc>
               <i>(Anno Hegirae)</i>
       1446 begins on or around 9 July 2024

      Some 80% of the world’s Muslims are Sunni, followers of `the path’ or customary way. They acknowledge the first four Caliphs as successors of Muhammad—Abu Bakr, Umar (Omar), Uthman (Othman) and Ali—and follow one of the four main schools of law. Other Muslims differ only in the interpretation of the true tradition (
      <i>sunna</i>
      ).
    </p>
          <p>
      The theologians of the Salafi 
      <i>ikhwan</i>
       (brotherhood’) advocate the strictest observance of the principle of monotheism, and reject the veneration of holy men and holy places, and advocate the removal of late accretions and innovations. The movement, which is often described (sometimes pejoratively) as `Wahhabism’, has become more prevalent in some regions of the Balkans, as elsewhere, in recent decades.
    </p>
          <p>
      The Shi`a, or `followers’ of `Ali (cousin of Muhammad and husband of Fatima, Muhammad’s daughter), reject the first three Caliphs of Sunni Islam and assert that the fourth Caliph was the rightful successor of Muhammad. `Ali’s son, Husain, is the great Shi`ite martyr. `Ali’s name is added after Muhammad’s in the confession of faith, but otherwise the fundamental beliefs of the Shi`a are broadly similar to those of the Sunnis. The Shi`a instituted an 
      <i>imam</i>
      , rather than a caliph, as their spiritual leader. Most Shi`ites are `Twelvers’ and recognize a succession of 12 Imams, the last disappearing in 878 
      <sc>ce</sc>
      ; this occluded or hidden Imam, it is believed, will return as the 
      <i>Mahdi</i>
       (`guided one’). However, some Shi`ites—the Isma`ilis—are known as `Seveners’ because they believe that Isma`il, or one of his sons, was the seventh and last Imam, disappearing in 765 
      <sc>ce</sc>
      . There were political reasons for the schism, but the Isma`ilis also have a more mystical faith. There are several sects.
    </p>
          <p>
      The Sufis are mystics, found in all branches of Islam since very early in the religion’s history. Named on account of their woollen 
      <i>(suf)</i>
       monastic robes, the Sufis tempered orthodox formalism and deism with a quest for complete identification with the Supreme Being and annihilation of the self (the existence of the latter is known as polytheism, 
      <i>shirk</i>
      ), although this sometimes approached pantheism. They are organized into what are loosely known as brotherhoods’ 
      <i>(turuq</i>
       or, singular, 
      <i>tariqa)</i>
      . Among Albanians, a Sufi dervish sect, the Bektashis, enjoyed strong support before the suppression of religion under communist rule; they made a revival during the early 1990s. Founded by Haji Bektash early in the 14th century, the sect flourished in the Balkans under the Ottoman Empire. Bektashi beliefs had a syncretic element, were less strict than those of most Muslims (and included the equal partici­pation of women), were practised in tekkes rather than ­mosques, and were taught by priests known as babas.

          <p>
      In the 20th and 21st centuries 
      <sc>ce</sc>
      , forms of Islam explicitly influenced by secular political ideologies, as well as by traditional Islamic teachings, and which promote the introduction of 
      <i>Shari`a</i>
       law as the basis of societal organization, or the re-establishment of the Caliphate, have grown in influence. Collectively these are often referred to as Islamism. The Muslim Brotherhood (Al-Ikhwan al-Muslimun), founded in Egypt in 1928, and the Hizb-ut-Tahrir al-Islami (Hizb-ut-Tahrir—Party of Islamic Liberation), which both state that they are committed to the peaceful implementation of their goals (despite branches of both organizations being proscribed as terrorist organizations in numerous countries), are among the major organizations internationally to promote this activist form of Islam, although neither has extensive direct influence in the countries of Central and South-Eastern Europe. The Islamic Revolution in Iran in 1979 also served to promote the growth of politicized forms of Islam internationally, but the relative international isolation of its post-revolutionary Governments, and the fact that the dominant form of Islam in Iran is the minority Shi`ite form, has served to inhibit the direct influence of the form of Islam promoted by the Iranian state, while the forms of Islam sponsored by the state religious authorities of Saudi Arabia and Türkiye have increased in influence in Europe and elsewhere.

          <p id="CAS.ESSAY.5.23">
      Judaism is the oldest of the major monotheistic religions, and also advocates a code of morality and civil and religious duties. Its holy book, the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible (which is broadly identical to the Old Testament of the Christian Bible) is supported by ancient rabbinic writings (the Talmud) and by traditions, which are expounded by the rabbis, who are doctors of the law and leaders of the Jewish congregations, which meet in synagogues. There are two main Jewish communities, which observe distinct rituals but have no doctrinal differences. The predominant European group is the Ashkenazim; the Sephardim of the region are mainly found in the Balkans. There are also small communities of Karaite Jews, who seek to follow a literal adherence to the meaning of the scriptures, without authoritative reference to later rabbinical teachings, in Poland and Lithuania. Although both Christianity and Islam claim descent from Judaism, the Jews, as a nation as well as members of a religion, have long been the victims of prejudice and persecution. The Jews were formerly widespread throughout Central and Eastern Europe. However, their numbers were very substantially reduced by the Holocaust 
      <i>(shoah)</i>
       of the Jewish people perpetrated during the Second World War in areas dominated by the Nazis and their allies. Anti-Semitic prejudices were, furthermore, on occasion promoted by many of the post-war communist regimes, in response to which many Jews either assimilated into their surrounding cultures or, when this was permitted, emigrated, most frequently to Israel but also, notably, to Germany and the USA; there had also been substantial Jewish emigration from Central and South-Eastern Europe, mostly to the USA, but also to South America and Western Europe, from the late 19th century. Following the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, Jewish emigration has continued, although there has also been a revival of communal organization and activity in several countries of the region; in the late 2010s the largest Jewish population in the region was in Hungary.
