          <p id="AL.GEOG.1">The Republic of Albania is situated in South-Eastern Europe, on the Balkan Peninsula. It is bordered by Greece to the south, by North Macedonia to the east, by Montenegro to the north and by Kosovo to the north-east. To the west there is a 420-km (260-mile) coastline along the Adriatic Sea and the Strait of Otranto (parts of the Mediterranean Sea). Albania covers an area of 28,748 sq&#160;km (11,100 sq&#160;miles).</p>
          <p id="AL.GEOG.2">More than three-quarters of Albania’s territory is mountain or hill country and nearly one-half is covered by woodland. The Albanian Alps, characterized by tall forests and alpine pastures, dominate the north of the country and rise to a height of 2,693&#160;m (8,835 ft) at Jezerce. The central mountain region lies between the valley of the River Drin in the north and the central Devoll and lower Osum valleys in the south. It is a less rugged area than the Alps, with wider valleys, dense forests and large lakes such as the Ohrid and Prespa, but it also has high peaks, reaching 2,751&#160;m at Mount Korabi, the highest point in the country. South of the Osum valley the more regular ranges of the southern mountain region continue into northern Greece and extend westwards to the sea. These three mountain areas surround the western coastal lowlands. Communications with the south and east, therefore, are difficult. There are, however, east-west routes along the valleys of the Shkumbin, Devoll and Drin rivers. The western lowlands extend some 200&#160;km from the foothills of the Alps in the north to Vlorë in the south and some 50&#160;km inland. The land is flat and marshy and extensive land reclamation was necessary to allow previously unused areas to be culti­vated.</p>

          <heading>Climate</heading>
          <p id="AL.GEOG.3">The climate is Mediterranean throughout much of the country, although winters in the mountain areas are cold, with snow cover lasting several months. Summers are hot and dry, with average July temperatures of 24°-25°C (75°-77°F). During the winter frequent cyclones make the weather un­stable, but it remains relatively mild in the plains, with January temperatures averaging 8°C (47°F) in the coastal town of Durrës, and 4°C (39°F) in the more northerly inland city of Shkodër. Average annual rainfall is 1,300&#160;mm, but regional variations are pronounced; in the Alps it is over 2,000&#160;mm, whereas in the valleys of the interior it is only 650&#160;mm-700&#160;mm.</p>

          <heading>Population</heading>
          <p id="AL.GEOG.4">According to official estimates, at 1 January 2023 the total population was 2,761,785, and the population density was 96.1 per sq km. At the census of October 2011 some 2,312,356 people (representing 82.6% of the population) were ethnic Albanians. (Some 15.5% of the population declined to describe their ethnic affiliation.) Other groups included 24,243 Greeks, 8,301 Roma, 8,266 Aromanians (also known as Vlachs), 5,512 Macedonians and 3,368 (Balkan) `Egyptian’ Roma.</p>
          <!--ethnic figs from 2011 census http://www.instat.gov.al/en/figures/statistical-databases/Present.aspx?rxid=cd0ceff6-c4c3-4edf-bb85-cdddfbd2f671-->
          <p id="AL.GEOG.5">According to the 2011 census, 56.7% of the population described themselves as Muslim, 10.0% as Catholic, 6.8% as Orthodox, 5.5% as `believers without denomination’, 2.5% as atheists, and 2.1% as Bektashi (a Sufi Muslim dervish order). Some 16.2% of the population declined to state a religious allegiance. In late 1990 and early 1991 the small community of around 300 Albanian Jews emigrated in its entirety to Israel.</p>
          <p id="AL.GEOG.6">The official language is Albanian, the principal dialects being Gheg (spoken north of the River Shkumbin) and Tosk (in the south). The literary language is a fusion of the two dialects, with the phonetic and morphological structure of Tosk prevailing. Ethnic Greeks continue to use their own language.</p>

          <p id="AL.GEOG.7">
      The majority of the population live on the coastal plains and nearly one-half of the population live outside major towns. There are many ethnic Albanians living in other countries, including some 1.6m. in Kosovo, and more than 500,000 in North Macedonia. The capital, Tirana (Tiranë), is situated in the centre of the country and had a population of 520,059 at mid-2023, according to projections by the United Nations. Other important towns include Durrës (Durazzo), Albania’s largest port (with a population of 113,249 according to the census of 1 October 2011), Vlorë (Vlonë or Valona), the second largest port (with a population of 79,513
      
       in 2011), Elbasan, a major industrial centre (with a population of 78,703), and Shkodër (Scutari—77,075).
