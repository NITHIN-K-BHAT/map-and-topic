          <heading>Between East and West</heading>
          <p>Albania, like other countries of the Western Balkans, has always existed between East and West, passing from the Roman to the Byzantine Empire, from the OsmanlI (Ottoman) to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and from the Eastern bloc to the West. In contrast to the situation in other Western Balkan countries, Albanians are descendants of Illyrians who, together with Romans, Macedonians, Thracians and Greeks, were one of the ancient peoples that inhabited the Balkan peninsula. Despite being one of the oldest peoples in Europe, Albanians were unable to form a nation-state and, in comparison with their neighbours, were late in constituting the basis for the modern state. Albania’s story has always been characterized by the passage between East and West and from one conqueror to another.</p>
          <p>
      The territories of modern Albania were ruled by the Roman Empire as a vassal state, never fully incorporating it. That is the reason why Illyria, which under the Romans became the province of Illyricum, preserved its language and characteristics. The Romans divided the lands that make up present-day Albania between the provinces of Macedonia, Dalmatia and Epirus. Illyrians distinguished themselves as warriors in the Roman legions and made up a significant portion of the Praetorian Guard. Indeed, several Roman emperors were of Illyrian origin. For about four centuries, Roman rule brought economic and cultural advancement to the Illyrian-populated lands and ended most of the debilitating clashes among local tribes, but it all came to an end when the Roman Empire divided into East and West in 395
      <sc>ad</sc>
      . The territories of modern Albania became part of the Byzantine Empire (the Eastern Roman Empire) and in the early Middle Ages were organized into themes, or military and administrative provinces. The Byzantine Empire was threatened from the 9th century, with attacks by foreign powers, including the Normans, Bulgarians, Angevins, Serbs and Venetians. The Albanian feudal nobility such as the Thopias, Balshas, Muzakas, Dukagjins and Kastriots established and ran their principalities. By the mid-14th century, Byzantine rule came to an end in Albania, and the Ottoman Turks invaded in 1388. In 1444 Gjergj Kastrioti, a prince of the Kastrioti family who is commonly known as Skanderbeg and who became a national hero, succeeded in uniting the Albanian principalities, hitherto divided by internal struggles, in the League of Lezhë. Keeping the Turks out of Albanian territories for 25 years, he turned Kruja, the city where he operated, into a fortress against the Ottoman Empire, benefiting the whole of Europe. As a consequence, Skanderbeg won esteem throughout Europe and support from Naples, Venice, Ragusa and the Papacy. After 1468, the year of Skanderbeg’s death, a large group of Albanians loyal to the leader of Kruja fled persecution by the Ottoman Turks to settle in southern Italy. Albanian territories came under the complete control of the Ottoman Empire and resulted in stagnation in the economic, cultural and social development of the country. The Ottoman occupation brought with it the mass conversion of the population from Roman Catholic and Orthodox to Islam, and consequently the country remained under the feudal system.
    </p>
          <p>During this period, a movement called the `Albanian Renaissance’ and developed among the Albanian diaspora led the social, cultural and national elements of the country towards a single goal: to gain autonomy and then the independence of Albania from the Ottoman Empire. This movement, which began in the 1830s and ended in 1912 with the country’s independence, arose during the crumbling of feudalism and the waning of the Ottoman Turks’ omnipotence in the Balkans. Faced with this weakening of the Ottoman Empire, which culminated in the Balkan wars, the Albanian Renaissance movement strongly proclaimed the unity of the country and the consolidation of national consciousness.</p>
          <p>In this situation, an Albanian activist, Ismail Qemali, undertook intense diplomatic activity with the Great Powers, seeking the support of Austria-Hungary and Italy. Fearing the Slavic-Greek threat at the Albanian borders, Austria and Italy agreed to support the need for Albanian autonomy and integrity, reassuring the Albanian delegation of their support, and communicating it to other European Governments. Disembarking from an Austrian steamer at Durrës, the Albanian delegation led by Ismail Qemali began the march towards Vlorë. In the mean time, delegates from all the Albanian regions had travelled to Vlorë, constituting what would become known as the National Congress of Vlorë. On 28 November 1912 the Congress, headed by Ismail Qemali, unanimously declared Albanian independence, with the delegates signing a historic act of independence. After nearly five centuries under Ottoman occupation Albania was an independent state. On 17 December 1912 the Conference of the Ambassadors (Conference of London) began in the British capital to review the situation of the Balkan states after the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire. The work of this Conference lasted for a long time. On 30 May 1913 the Ottoman Emperor renounced the European territories, leaving the delimitation of the Albanian border and all other matters concerning Albania to the Great Powers of Russia, Austria-Hungary, France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom. The Conference of Ambassadors recognized Albania as a separate state, the territory of which needed only to be demarcated; as a result of the delimitation some Albanian-occupied territory was ceded to Serbia, Montenegro and Greece. Albania was proclaimed an autonomous sovereign hereditary principality under the guarantee of the six Great Powers until the latter agreed for Prince William I Wied from Neuwid of Germany to reign as sovereign. When the First World War broke out in 1914, Prince Wied had to leave Albania. His weak and fragmented rule had become unsustainable amid the rivalry between Austria-Hungary and Italy. Thus in September of that year Prince Wied abandoned Durazzo, then the capital of Albania, for exile in Venice. By leaving, William I Wied left Albania even more divided and devastated, without an authority capable of co-ordinating differences and able to give political-administrative guidance.</p>

          <heading>Between Monarchy and Parliamentarianism</heading>
          <p>By the end of the First World War in 1918, Albania was a country in chaos. Governments came in rapid succession because of the constant struggles between various interest groups, with their leaders weakened by successive administrations. In 1923 alone there were five different Governments in place. Unexpectedly, in June 1924 the Government of Fan Noli succeeded in taking office, albeit outside the normal electoral process, thus he lacked international support. Nevertheless, Noli promoted various democratic reforms, which provided for innovative agricultural, administrative and judicial changes that were, nevertheless, difficult to implement. Noli’s period in office became known as the `June Revolution’ because he came to power as the result of an armed uprising, rather than democratic elections. This period ended within six months, due to the entry into Tirana in December of armed troops led by Ahmed Bey Zog (Ahmet Zogu), previously Minister of the Interior and later Prime Minister between 1922 and 1924. His troops were supported by the Government of Serbia, where he had taken refuge during Noli’s Government, and he was to become President and King of Albania. It would be the start of a long period in power, which was to last until 1939, when King Zog was compelled to leave Albania due to the Italian invasion, and Albania was declared an Italian Protectorate.</p>
          <p>During this period, Tirana and other cities were at the centre of a vast programme of public works, the results of which still stand out today for their quantity and for the quality of their architecture. Buildings were built in the cities of Albania, and especially in Tirana, by the Italian fascist Government between 1926 and 1942. They have been preserved and are used as the headquarters of the current administrative and institutional functions. About 20 Italian engineers and architects participated in their constructions, including Armando Brasini, Gherardo Bosio and Vittorio Ballio Morpurgo, artists such as Antonio Maraini, and landscape architects such as Pietro Porcinai. There were two important agreements signed in the course of that period between the Government of Tirana and that of Rome. The first was concluded on 27 November 1926, known as the Pact of Friendship and Security, on the basis of which Italy became the guarantor of Albanian independence, defined as a fundamental and indispensable element for Italian security. On 22 November 1927 the Treaty of Defensive Alliance between the two countries, or the Pact of Tirana, was signed. Italy recognized Albania’s equal status, and their mutual interest in avoiding any legal, political or territorial change in Albania was established. Having signed the agreements, Zog decided to transform the presidential republic into a monarchy, proclaiming himself King of the Albanians on 1 September 1928, after having secured Italian support for the change to the Constitution. Internal pressures forced Zog to modify his stance towards Italy. Italian professional institutes came under Albanian management and a state public education system was organized, causing serious damage to the private Catholic institutes financed by Italy, while the mandates of the Italian officers present in Albania were not renewed. This series of events damaged relations between the two states. The situation deteriorated and ultimately Italian dictator Benito Mussolini managed to achieve what he had always aimed for: the occupation of Albania. On the night of 6-7 April 1939, some 30,000 men, with the support of the navy and air force, landed in Albanian ports. The Albanian response was weak because the modest Albanian army was not called upon by King Zog at all. An improvised resistance was organized in the city of Durrës where, however, defences were very weak. Eight sailors and three Bersaglieri (Italian marksmen) lost their lives. This attack marked the end of Albanian independence and of the reign of King Zog, who followed by a group of loyalists, took refuge in Greece, and then in Egypt. </p>

          <heading>Between Totalitarianism and a Pluralistic Regime</heading>
          <p>During the Second World War, an Albanian national liberation movement known as the Lëvizja Nacional Çlirimtare (National Liberation Movement) emerged, a movement bringing together all Albanians opposing fascism. The Albanian National Liberation Movement’s General Council appointed Enver Hoxha as General Commander of the Liberation Forces. Aided by the progress of the events of the Second World War, Albania achieved the liberation of all its territories on 29 November 1944. Hoxha, also the leader of the Partia Komuniste e Shqipërisë (PKSh—Albanian Communist Party), constituted the first provisional Government recognized by the USA and the USSR. Hoxha’s Government would be an embryonic version of the `iron fist’ communist dictatorship that established itself in Albania for almost five decades with him as the undisputed leader.</p>
          <p>After the Second World War, in Albania as in other Eastern European countries, communist dictatorship was established, with a single party, the Partia e Punës e Shqipërisë (PPSh—Albanian Party of Labour), which succeeded the PKSh in 1948 and found its full expression under Hoxha’s leadership. Head of both the armed forces and the communist party during the war, Hoxha combined powers of persuasion with high intelligence, and was a strong supporter of the theories of Karl Marx, as well as the Russian and Soviet leaders Vladimir Ulyanov (Lenin) and Iosif Dzhugashvili (Stalin). Implementing Marxist-Leninist ideology to extremes, he became the architect of one of the most ruthless dictatorships in Eastern Europe. In the first post-war decade, Albania had excellent relations first with Josip Tito’s Yugoslavia (1945-48) and later with Stalin’s USSR (1948-61). Stalin was a sort of sacred idol for the Albanian form of communist ideology. In schools and public administration buildings, his photograph was placed next to Hoxha’s. With Stalin's death in 1953, relations between the two states froze due to Nikita Khrushchev’s criticism of Stalin and his policies. Relations worsened until they were finally severed in 1961. As a result, Albania moved closer to Mao Zedong’s People’s Republic of China. Between 1965 and 1969, the Albanian regime was on excellent terms with China and even tried to import the Chinese cultural revolution, while China supported the regime with economic aid. But even this friendship did not last very long, starting to dissolve around 1976 owing to the Chinese economic and political reforms promoted by Deng Xiaoping. In 1978 there was a complete detachment of Albania from China and China withdrew technicians and economic aid from Albania. After that, Albanians experienced a period of complete isolation from the whole world. The isolation of the regime was justified by fear of external attacks and imagined internal plots, which were used to eliminate not only opponents but also those party members or personalities who expressed opinions that differed from those of the dictator. Under these circumstances, the secret police, the Directorate of State Security (or Sigurimi), had a decisive role in eliminating any elements coming from abroad and in the physical elimination of those who deviated from the `teachings’ of the PPSh. One of the extreme measures taken by the communist regime was the introduction of a total ban on the practice of religion. Within three months in 1967, around 2,169 religious establishments (churches, mosques, monasteries) had been closed or even razed to the ground in Albania. The new situation was presented in the regime press as an extraordinary event: Albania became, by the `will of its people’, the first atheist country in the world. Moreover, under the Constitution of 1976 private property was abolished. Freedom of expression and association did not exist. From 1945 to 1985, the year of Hoxha’s death, the country suffered unprecedented terror, party monotheism and class struggle, which led to the imprisonment or elimination of members of the intelligentsia and opposition figures by the ruling communist elite. After Hoxha’s death, the regime loosened the knot. Nevertheless, the communist regime collapsed in December 1990, being the last in South-Eastern Europe to fall. Elsewhere in Central and South-Eastern Europe, communist regimes had collapsed immediately after the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989.</p>
          <p>After almost half a century of this totalitarian regime, in December 1990 Albanian students began to initiate protests demanding the overthrow of the totalitarian system in the country. The student movement of December 1990 started in Tirana and spread in a short time throughout the country. One of its first achievements was forcing the communist regime to accept political pluralism as an essential instrument for democracy. On 12 December the decision to create the Partia Demokratike e Shqipërisë (PDSh—Albanian Democratic Party was announced, and it became the first alternative opposition party after the long period of communist dictatorship. Albania’s first multi-party elections were held in March 1991. Although the political spectrum in Albania was enriched with other right, left or centre party formations, it would remain dominated by the right-wing PDSh and the successor to the PPSh, the Partia Socialiste e Shqipërisë (PSSh—Albanian Socialist Party) until the present day.</p>

          <heading>The Transition to Democratic State Consolidation</heading>
          <p>As in other Eastern European countries, Albania embarked on the arduous transition from communist dictatorship to pluralistic democracy and from centrally administered to market economies. In the early 1990s, the country was subject to a `shock therapy’ approach, which interacted with social and political collapse and produced the collapse of the state (a phenomenon that would be repeated in 1997 with the so-called pyramid crisis). Corruption, a lack of economic investment and a weak rule of law dominated the period of transition to democracy until 1997. Then, the pyramid crisis, so described because many Albanians lost their life savings to `pyramid’ investment schemes, escalated into violent civil unrest in the first months of 1997. During this period, the Government and state policy collapsed and more than 2,000 people were killed. Nevertheless, despite the severity of the 1997 crisis, the political parties refused to accept each other’s perspective and failed to reach a consensus through dialogue, a dialogue that the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) ultimately facilitated by sending one of its representatives, the former Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, to Tirana to mediate talks between the opposing political forces. Only after that did it become possible to establish a Qeveria e Pajtimit Kombëtar (Government of National Reconciliation) with the participation of both political sides.</p>
          <p>Its main goal, beyond the stabilization of the situation, was the organization of early elections, which were held in June 1997. These elections were won by the PSSh, with 52.7% of the votes, while the PDSh received only 25.8%. However, the PDSh refused to recognize the results of the elections, and boycotted parliament. It finally entered the Assembly after 13 August, only to resume its boycott after Azem Hajdari, the deputy chairman of the PDSh and former leader of the student movement that had emerged in 1990, was attacked and seriously wounded inside the legislature on 18 September. The political crisis deepened when Hajdari was subsequently assassinated in September 1998. Finally, in July 1999, as a result of significant pressure from international institutions, the PDSh agreed to end the boycott. Following the advice of international economic institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, the PSSh continued to open up the Albanian market to foreign goods, withdrew the state from many aspects of economic and social life and privatized large numbers of state enterprises, with auctions in favour of foreign capital. During this process, the PSSh made use of a discourse that emphasized the technical aspects of the reforms for the installation of democracy and the development of a market economy and the integration of Albania into the European Union (EU).</p>
          <p>The elections of 24 June 2001 were won by the left, but these elections were not recognized by the opposition, which again decided to boycott the Assembly. Under pressure from international organizations, it was decided to end the boycott and for the opposition to return to the legislature. Nevertheless, there were also rivalries between factions of the PSSh led, respectively, by Fatos Nano and Ilir Meta, which led to the splintering of the PSSh and the creation in 2004 of the Lëvizja Socialiste për Integrim (LSI—Socialist Movement for Integration) led by Meta. Unable to control Meta’s faction and with the emergence of the new party, the PSSh no longer had the support required for a majority, and it decided to accept Alfred Moisiu, proposed by the PDSh’s Sali Berisha, as a presidential candidate—a candidate who was duly elected by the Assembly on 24 July 2002. From the early 2000s the LSI (known as the Partia e Lirisë—Freedom Party from 2022) slowly began to position itself as a third pillar in the Albanian political scene that helped influence the composition of coalitions on both the left and right.</p>
          <p>In the 2005 legislative elections, levels of political conflict remained high. The elections were won by the PDSh, bringing a PDSh-led coalition to power after eight years of PSSh leadership. Political life was dominated in 2007 by tensions around the election of the President, for which, again, consensus was impossible to achieve. Finally, after three rounds of presidential voting, Bamir Topi was elected as President as a result of the backing of supporters of Edi Rama, who had succeeded Berisha as PSSh leader. Importantly, in 2008 a compromise agreement was reached between the democrats and the socialists for a package of reforms providing for important constitutional changes with implications for electoral reform and the establishment of a system of regional proportional representation for the election of members of the Assembly, for limiting the hitherto unlimited mandate of the Attorney-General to five years, as well as for the method of electing the President. Prime Minister Berisha described the changes as a `historical victory for Albanian democracy’, while Rama stated that the electoral reform `closed a long chapter of great distortions of the voters’ will’. Nevertheless, the process of electoral reform increased the discontent of smaller parties, which were not consulted about the changes and which, with the implementation of the new rules, found it more difficult to achieve representation at the national level. As will become evident, the closed lists that came out of this `historical’ agreement between the two major parties would increase their leaders’ power to appoint the party representatives to be voted on by the electorate and would make it harder for ordinary citizens to enter politics and represent the population directly, without having to be selected from the party.</p>
          <p>On 28 June 2009 Albania held its seventh multi-party parliamentary elections since the end of the communist regime. Although the country’s main political forces were still engaged in a bitter political struggle, the political environment was less polarized than had been the case in the past. In these elections, the PDSh won 68 of the 140 seats available, the PSSh won 65 and the LSI won four. The Partia Republikane e Shqipërisë (PRSh—Republican Party of Albania) and the Partia për Drejtësi dhe Integrim (PDI—Party for Justice and Unity) each won one seat, and the Partia Bashkimi për të Drejtat e Njeriut (Unity for Human Rights Party), representing the Greek minority and in coalition with the PSSh, also won a seat. The Government coalition was made up of the PDSh, the LSI and three smaller parties: the PRSh, the PDI and the Partia Agrare Ambientaliste (Agrarian Environmentalist Party). PSSh leader Edi Rama refused to accept the election results, accusing the Government of electoral fraud and announcing that the PSSh would boycott the new Assembly. The PSSh filed a complaint with the Komisioni Qendror i Zgjyedhjeve (KQZ—Central Election Commission) contesting the results in some districts and requested the reopening of some of the ballot boxes. After the requests were rejected by the KQZ, the PSSh appealed to the electoral college, which again refused to reopen the ballot boxes. The opposition duly initiated protests by boycotting parliament. The PSSh increased its anti-Government rhetoric by organizing protests in Tirana as well as a hunger strike in 2010 under the so-called `çadër’ (a giant rainproof tent). The protests continued, culminating in a large protest in Tirana on 21 January 2011 at which there were clashes with police, and four protesters were killed by the Republican Guard, an institutional body under the control of the Minister of the Interior, Lulzim Basha, at that time a strong political ally of Prime Minister Sali Berisha. Rama (who was also Mayor of Tirana) was accused by Berisha of fuelling the violent unrest, while Rama condemned the government response to the protests.</p>

          <heading>21st Century Milestones</heading>
          <p>Meanwhile, throughout the first decade of the 21st century several important developments in Albania’s foreign and domestic affairs took place, including the signature of a Stabilization and Association Agreement with the EU in 2006, membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 2009 and an agreement with the EU on visa liberalization in 2010. The Albanian population was largely enthusiastic about these events, but they were not enough to ensure victory for the PDSh in the elections held on 23 June 2013. The PDSh lost its parliamentary majority, with a coalition of political forces composed mainly of the PSSh and the LSI, winning 84 seats, and a coalition led by the PDSh winning 56. PSSh leader Rama became Prime Minister of Albania through a pre-election alliance with LSI leader Meta, whom he had, however, accused of deep-rooted corruption while in opposition. The political alliance thus seemed uncomfortable, but it endured until 2017 under continuous criticism and public accusations that the LSI was using administrative appointments to support a clientelist network. The socialist parliamentary majority also ultimately supported Meta to secure election as President of Albania on 28 April 2017, and—despite later impeachment efforts—he retained in post until 24 July 2022, when Gen. (retd) Bajram Begaj was sworn in, having been voted President in June.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, during the electoral campaign for the elections due on 25 June 2017, Rama asked the people to vote for him and his PSSh, as they would `drive with both hands on the wheel’. A large number of people did as he asked, and the party won some 48% of the votes, followed by the PDSh with 29% and the LSI with 14%. During his second mandate in 2017-21, his leadership concentrated on bringing forward the reforms that had begun under the previous mandate. The territorial reform of 2014 represented an important change in domestic policy that brought about changes to the administrative and territorial structure of the country, having as its final aim the decentralization of power at the local level. The number of municipalities was reduced from 373 to 61, to create larger and better-functioning governing entities, while the number of regions remained the same, at 12. This process, together with the reforms to public administration started in 2015, improved the public-administration sector and increased efficiency in public services.</p>
          <p>Constitutional amendments had been needed for the justice reform to be approved in the Assembly on 21 July 2016, after strong advocacy by the USA and the EU’s representatives in Albania. The goal of this reform was to build an independent and efficient justice system. This process included the creation of new judicial bodies, the implementation of a new vetting system (for the verification of high justice representatives), as well as the strengthening of the capacities and independence of the courts and the prosecution. With the vetting process high on its agenda, the justice reforms were considered a precondition for the beginning of accession talks with Albania and the EU, but these reforms were not deemed sufficient.</p>
          <p>Despite the European Commission’s recommendations to the European Council in both 2018 and 2019 that it open accession negotiations with Albania, the European Council did not initially decide in favour of Albania on this issue owing to a French veto, but decided to make it contingent on the implementation of internal EU reforms. In November 2019 France published a `non-paper’ outlining its recommendations regarding this process (recommendations that looked a lot like conditions that, if approved in that form, would have effectively provided for the countries of the Western Balkans region never to join the EU). Fortunately for those states, nine countries (Austria, the Czech Republic, Italy, Slovenia, Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Malta), put together another non-paper in December that appeared to soften the French proposals. The new methodology was duly published by the European Commission in February 2020, and it represented a compromise between the approach of the French bloc, which did not favour enlargement to the Western Balkans, and that of the countries that supported it. In 2021 the process of opening accession negotiations with both Albania and North Macedonia was blocked again, this time by a Bulgarian veto, primarily due to unresolved historic disputes with North Macedonia.</p>
          <p>In terms of foreign affairs, the full-scale war in Ukraine from February 2022 led to a change in the position of the European Council towards the Western Balkans. France, the country that was holding the rotating presidency of the Council of EU in the first half of 2022, made efforts to unblock the dispute with Bulgaria by advocating a special agreement between Bulgaria and North Macedonia, and accession negotiations with both countries opened in July 2022. Meanwhile, Germany was doing its utmost to revitalize the Berlin Process (a German initiative started in 2014) for the Western Balkans throughout 2022 to put the countries of the region back on track in terms of European integration. On 6 December an EU-Western Balkans summit was held in Tirana, marking the first occasion that a Western Balkan country had hosted such a high-level summit within its territory.</p>

          <heading>Domestic and Foreign Policy under Edi Rama in 2013-23</heading>
          <p>In legislative elections on 25 April 2021 Rama secured a third term in office, when the PSSh won 48.7% of the votes and 74 seats, while the PDSh was again second-placed, leading an alliance that obtained 39.4% of the votes and 59 seats. Thus, over the last decade, the socialist Prime Minister of Albania has dominated the political scene in Albania. In the process he has developed an active and unusual foreign policy for a small country like Albania. The first clear sign of this approach was the elevation of Turkey (known as Türkiye from June 2022) to the status of strategic partner, much like the USA, in his government programme in 2013. Subsequently, Türkiye has become an important ally of Albania that has not only supported the country financially but has also paved the way for the development of an active regional policy, with Albania benefiting from the backing of a second NATO military power. The alliance between the two countries reached its highest point with the financial support provided to Albania during the reconstruction process after earthquakes in Albania in 2019 and during the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic from 2020.</p>
          <p>Albania has stabilized its growing historical links with the USA. The USA supported Albania not only in its progress in implementing judicial reforms, but also in the fight against corruption and in EU integration. The revelation that Albania had agreed to admit Iranian mujahideen, reportedly at the request of the USA, demonstrates the interrelated relationship between the two countries. Albania has improved its relations with the Gulf States, especially after the Emaar Group from the United Arab Emirates agreed in 2021 to invest some €2,000m. over a period of five years in the port at Durrës, the second major city in Albania. Collaboration with China has also increased. Meanwhile, Albania has passed from dealing with Russia straightforwardly from a NATO member state perspective, to expressing fervent opposition to its attack on Ukraine.</p>
          <p>In the domestic sphere, Rama’s leadership has been challenged by several difficult situations, including the resignation and subsequent imprisonment of former Minister of Interior Saimir Tahiri, who was found guilty of abuse of office in 2022, and accused of involvement in drug trafficking in 2017, and student protests from December 2018, when students spontaneously organized a long series of protests that would help ensure reforms in higher education.</p>
          <p>The objective of initiating accession negotiations with the EU in October 2019 motivated Rama to play a very active role in increasing Albania’s profile in the wider region, at a time when the Berlin Process was not delivering. Edi Rama, together with Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić and Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, launched the `Mini Schengen’ initiative in 2019, which was turned into the Open Balkan initiative by the same leaders in 2021. Despite being a regional initiative aiming at facilitating the movement of goods, people and services, the non-participation of Kosovo compromised popular support for it in Albania. Since Rama took office as Prime Minister of Albania, the holding of joint meetings between the Kosovo and Albanian Governments has become a tradition, at which agreements on increased co-operation are signed. In May 2023, during a summit of the Council of Europe in Reykjavík, Iceland, the Albanian premier urged the Assembly of the Council of Europe to withdraw allegations that the Kosovo Liberation Army had been involved in organ trafficking, which had been made in an infamous report by Swiss parliamentarian and former state prosecutor Dick Marty back in 2010.</p>

      Meanwhile, a political crisis emerged within the Albanian opposition PDSh, after the USA proclaimed its former leader, Sali Berisha, 
      <i>persona non grata</i>
       in May 2021, owing to accusations of abuse of power and corruption during his tenure as Prime Minister of Albania. After the leader of the PDSh, Lulzim Basha, expelled him from the party, a deep crisis in the opposition led to the division of the party into two factions, which served to strengthen Rama’s political power. This strengthening of power was reflected in results of the local elections of 14 May 2023, when the PSSh won 51 out of 61 municipalities.

      Albania’s chairmanship of the OSCE during 2020 undoubtedly represented a historic achievement in terms of its foreign policy. Albania was also elected a non-permanent member of the UN’s Security Council in 2022-23, following years of lobbying and an intensive foreign-policy campaign. In mid-2022 a series of cyber-attacks launched by Iranian cyber-terrorists targeted the Albanian government web portal e-Albania and the government server administrata.al. The Albanian Prime Minister reacted firmly, and the Government cut ties with Iran, issuing an ultimatum to diplomatic staff to leave the country. Meanwhile, the positioning of Albania on the side of the West by condemning the war in Ukraine and the support of Ukraine against the Russian invasion has been clearly evident despite Ukraine’s non-recognition of Kosovo. Rama has repeatedly asked for the future recognition of Kosovo by the countries that have not yet done so. Nevertheless, his relations with the current Prime Minister of Kosovo, Vetëvendosje leader Albin Kurti, have not been positive of late. After several ups and downs since Kurti came to power for the second time in 2021, recent events in northern Kosovo seem to have sealed their political distance. On 13 June 2023 Rama announced the cancellation of the ninth joint meeting between the Governments of Albania and Kosovo due to `the circumstances of Kosovo’s aggravated relations with the entire Euro-Atlantic community’
      
      . The cancellation of the meeting came after Kurti had failed to consider a draft submitted by Rama regarding the creation of an `Association of Serb Municipalities’ (for those Serb-majority municipalities located in northern Kosovo), deemed necessary by the EU for the normalization of relations between Kosovo and Serbia.
