               <p id="AL.IS.3">The Republic of Albania lies in South-Eastern Europe. It is bordered by Montenegro to the north, Kosovo to the north-east, North Macedonia to the east, Greece to the south and the Adriatic and Ionian Seas (parts of the Mediterranean Sea) to the west. The climate is Mediterranean throughout most of the country. The sea plays a moderating role, although frequent cyclones occur in the winter. The average temperature is 14°C (57°F) in the north-east and 18°C (64°F) in the south-west. The language is Albanian, the principal dialects being Gheg (north of the Shkumbin river) and Tosk, which is spoken in the south and has been the official dialect since 1952. Islam is the predominant faith, but there are small groups of Christians (mainly Catholic in the north and Eastern Orthodox in the south). The national flag (proportions 5 by 7) is red, with a two-headed black eagle in the centre. The capital is Tirana (Tiranë).</p>

                    <heading>Historical Context</heading>
                    <p id="AL.IS.5">On 28 November 1912, after more than 400 years of Turkish rule, Albania declared independence. Occupied by Italy in 1914, its independence was re-established in 1920. Albania was declared a republic in 1925 and Ahmet Beg Zogu was elected President; proclaimed King Zog I in 1928, he was forced into exile by the Italian occupation of Albania in April 1939. Albania was united with Italy for four years, then occupied by German forces during 1943-44. The communist-led Lëvizja Nacional Çlirimtare (LNÇ—National Liberation Front) took power in November 1944. Only communist candidates contested elections in December 1945. The new regime was headed by Enver Hoxha, the leader of the Partia Komuniste e Shqipërisë (PKSh—Albanian Communist Party). King Zog was deposed, and the People’s Republic of Albania was proclaimed on 11 January 1946. The PKSh was renamed the Partia e Punës e Shqipërisë (PPSh—Albanian Labour Party) in 1948. Hoxha resigned as Head of Government in 1954, but retained effective national leadership as First Secretary of the PPSh.</p>
                    <p id="AL.IS.8">A new Constitution was adopted in 1976, renaming the country the People’s Socialist Republic of Albania. In 1981 Mehmet Shehu, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers (Prime Minister) since 1954, died. Although he was officially reported to have committed suicide, there were allegations that he had been executed amid a leadership struggle with Hoxha. A Government headed by Adil Çarçani, hitherto the First Deputy Chairman, was established. In November 1982 Ramiz Alia replaced Haxhi Lleshi as head of state, as President of the Presidium of the Kuvendi Popullor (People’s Assembly). A number of former state and PPSh officials were reportedly executed in September 1983. Hoxha died in April 1985, and was succeeded as First Secretary of the PPSh by Alia.</p>
                    <p id="AL.IS.10">Anti-Government demonstrations took place from December 1989, and in January 1990 Alia announced proposals for political and economic reform, including the introduction of multi-candidate elections. The practise of religion (prohibited since 1967) was once again tolerated, and Albanians were granted the right to foreign travel. Following renewed unrest in July 1990, over 5,000 Albanians were granted permission to leave the country, after taking refuge in foreign embassies. In December it was announced that the establishment of inde­pendent political parties was to be per­mitted, prior to elections. None the less, there was further unrest in mid-December.</p>

                    <p id="AL.IS.12">On 20 February 1991, following widespread protests, Alia declared presidential rule. Çarçani was replaced as Chairman of the Council of Ministers by Fatos Nano, a liberal economist. In March a general amnesty for political pris­oners was declared. Multi-party legislative elections took place in March-April. The PPSh and affiliated organizations won 169 of the 250 seats, the Partia Demokratike e Shqipërisë (PDSh—Albanian Democratic Party) secured 75 seats, and the Democratic Union of the Greek Minority (OMONIA) five. The results, amid allegations of electoral malpractice, prompted protests, and in the northern town of Shkodër security forces killed four demonstrators.</p>
                    <p id="AL.IS.14">In April 1991 an interim Constitution replaced that of 1976. The country was renamed the Republic of Albania, and the post of executive President, elected by the People’s Assembly, was created. Alia was elected to the new post, obliging his resignation from the PPSh leadership. In June a general strike forced the resignation of Nano’s administration. A subsequent Government of National Stability included representatives of the PPSh (later the Partia Socialiste e Shqipërisë—PSSh—Albanian Socialist Party), the PDSh, the Partia Republika e Shqipërisë (PRSh—Albanian Republican Party), the Partia Social­demokrate e Shqipërisë (PSD—Albanian Social Democratic Party) and the Partia Agrare e Shqipërisë (PAS—Albanian Agrarian Party). Ylli Bufi became Chairman of the Council of Ministers. In December the PDSh Chairman, Sali Berisha, announced the withdrawal of his party’s seven representatives from the Government, which, following the dismissal of three PRSh ministers, forced its collapse. Alia appointed an interim Government of non-party `technocrats’ under Vilson Ahmeti.</p>
                    <p id="AL.IS.17">At a general election on 22 and 29 March 1992 the PDSh secured 92 of the 140 legislative seats, the PSSh 38, the PSD seven, the Partia Bashkimi për të Drejtat e Njeriut (PBDNj—Union for Human Rights Party, supported by the minority Greek and Macedonian communities) two and the PRSh one seat. Following Alia’s resignation, the legislature elected Berisha as President on 9 April. Berisha appointed a coalition Government led by Aleksander Meksi of the PDSh. In September divisions within the PDSh resulted in the defection of several prominent party members, who formed the Partia Aleanca Demokratike (PAD—Democratic Alliance Party).</p>
                    <p id="AL.IS.19">During 1992-93 a number of former communist officials were arrested on charges of corruption and abuse of power, including the widow of Enver Hoxha, Nexhmije Hoxha, who was imprisoned until 1997, having been convicted of embezzling state funds. In August 1993 Ahmeti was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment. Despite a campaign on his behalf, in April 1994 Nano (by this time Chairman of the PSSh) was sentenced to 12 years’ imprisonment for the misappropri­ation of state funds during his premiership. Alia was sentenced to nine years’ imprisonment in July, but was re­leased in 1995.</p>
                    <p id="AL.IS.20">Despite an extensive reorganization of the Council of Ministers in December 1994, the PRSh and the main faction of the PSD withdrew from the governing coalition. In September 1995 the People’s Assembly (later known as the Kuvendi i Shqipërisë—Assembly of Albania) adopted legislation prohibiting those in power under the former communist regime from holding public office until 2002. In November 1995 a parliamentary commission initiated an inquiry, following the discovery of a mass grave near the border town of Shkodër. Families of the deceased urged the prosecution service to charge former communist officials, including Alia, who was accused of ordering the killing by border guards of nationals attempting to flee Albania in 1990-92; he was detained in February 1996. In May three prominent former communist officials received death sentences (later commuted to terms of imprisonment) following charges of involvement in the execution, internment and deportation of citizens, and 11 received custodial sentences.</p>
                    <p id="AL.IS.24">The first round of legislative elections took place on 26 May 1996. Following alleged electoral irregularities, the principal opposition parties withdrew from the poll, and security forces violently dispersed a demonstration by the PSSh. Only 59% of the electorate participated in the second round of voting on 2 June (compared with 89% in the first round). Berisha rejected reports by international observers of malpractice, but agreed to conduct further elections in 17 constituencies. With the principal opposition parties continuing their boycott, the PDSh won all the seats contested in the repeated polls on 16 June, and secured 122 of the 140 available seats. (However, the PSSh, which won 10 seats, began a boycott of the legislature.) Meksi formed a new Council of Ministers in July. In August the Government established a permanent Central Election Commission (Komisioni Qendror i Zgjyedhjeve—KQZ).</p>
                    <is-section id="AL.IS.12651466111" sllink="SLSDOC" slsdocrf="IS-SECTREF">
                         <heading>Civil Uprising</heading>
                         <p>
            In January 1997 the collapse of several popular pyra­mid’ financial investment schemes prompted violent anti-Government demonstrations. It was widely believed that members of the Government were associated with the pyramid schemes, which had allegedly financed illegal activities. After an escalation in hostilities between insurgents and government troops in the south of the country, Berisha declared a state of emergency at the beginning of March. On 3 March Berisha was re-elected unopposed by the legislature to a second five-year term. Following negotiations with opposition representatives, he signed an agreement providing for the installation of an interim co­ali­tion government, pending elections in June, and offered an amnesty to rebels who surrendered to the authorities. A former PSSh mayor of Gjirokastër, Bashkim Fino, was appointed as Prime Minister on 11 March, and a Government of National Reconciliation was formed. None the less, the insurgency continued, reaching Tirana. Those detained in the capital’s central prison, including Nano and Alia, were released; Berisha subsequently granted Nano an official pardon. By late March government forces had regained control of Tirana, although insurgent groups held the south of the country. The Government requested military assistance in the restoration of civil order. After the United Nations (UN) Security Council endorsed a proposal by the 
            <xr pageref="Y" ref="OSCE.IO">Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)</xr>
            , a 5,915-member Multinational Protection Force for Albania was established in April, with a mandate to facilitate the distribution of humanitarian assistance. The PSSh ended its legislative boycott in the same month.
          </p>
                         <p>Election campaigning was marred by violence, including bomb explosions in Tirana. On 29 June 1997 the first round of voting in the legislative elections took place. A further ballot took place on 6 July. Observers from the OSCE declared the elections to have been con­ducted satisfactorily. Later in July the KQZ announced that the PSSh had secured 101 seats (obtaining, together with allied parties, a two-thirds’ majority), while the PDSh had won 29 seats. At a concurrent referendum, 66.7% of the electorate voted in favour of retaining a republic. On 24 July, after Berisha resigned as President, the legislature elected Rexhep Mejdani, the Secretary-General of the PSSh, as his successor, and voted to end the state of emergency. The PSSh proposed Nano as Prime Minister, and a new Council of Ministers, comprising representatives of the PSSh and its allies, was appointed. At the end of July the legislature voted in favour of auditing existing pyramid schemes and investigating those that had been dissolved. After the Government dispatched troops to the south of the country in August, it was announced that Vlorë and other major towns that had been occupied by rebel forces had been recaptured. By mid-August the Multinational Protection Force had left Albania.</p>
                         <p>However, intermittent violent unrest continued, and in February 1998 government troops suppressed an armed revolt by civilians and disaffected members of the security forces in Shkodër. In September a senior member of the PDSh was assassinated in Tirana. Berisha accused Nano of involvement, and the PDSh resumed its boycott of the legislature. The incident prompted violent protests by PDSh supporters, who seized government offices and occupied the state television and radio buildings. Government security forces regained control of the capital after clashes with protesters, in which about seven people were reportedly killed. In September the Minister of Public Order resigned. Shortly afterwards Nano resigned, and in October a new Council of Ministers, headed by Pandeli Majko, the Secretary-General of the PSSh, was installed. Later that month the legislature approved a new Constitution, drafted by a parliamentary commission, which was endorsed at a national referendum by 93.5% of the electorate (with 50.6% participating) on 22 November. The Constitution was adopted on 28 November. In October 1999 Nano was re-elected as PSSh Chairman. Mejdani nominated Ilir Meta (hitherto Deputy Prime Minister) as Prime Minister, and in November a new Government was approved in the Assembly (despite a PDSh boycott).</p>
                         <p>Legislative elections were conducted on 24 June and 8 July 2001. Ballots were repeated in eight constituencies in July-August. According to the final results, the PSSh won 73 seats and a PDSh-led coalition, Bashkimi për Fitoren (Union for Victory), won 46 seats in the 140-seat Assembly. A reorganized Council of Ministers, again under Meta, was approved in September. In December divisions emerged within the PSSh, after Nano accused the Government of corruption. Four PSSh ministers, including the Minister of Finance, subsequently resigned. On 29 January 2002 Meta also resigned, after the two PSSh factions failed to reach agreement on the appointment of new ministers. Majko of the PSSh was appointed as Prime Minister on 7 February. The Assembly approved a new Council of Ministers, in which portfolios were divided between supporters of Nano and Meta, on 22 February.</p>
                         <p>Following controversy over Mejdani’s successor, Alfred Moisiu, a retired general, was elected President by legislative deputies in June 2002. Moisiu appointed Nano to the premiership, and a new administration, including members of both PSSh factions, was approved, with Majko returning to his previous post as Minister of Defence; Meta became Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs. A new electoral code was adopted in June 2003. However, dissent between the PSSh factions culminated in Meta’s resignation from the Government in mid-July. Local government elections on 12 October led to reports by OSCE observers of irregularities. Further rounds of voting were conducted in December, after a court of appeal upheld PDSh allegations of malpractice.</p>
                         <p>In September 2004 the ruling coalition was weakened by Meta’s resignation from the PSSh, and his establishment of the Lëvizja Socialiste për Integrim (LSI—Socialist Movement for Integration). The PSSh consequently lost its parliamentary majority. Legislative elections took place on 3 July 2005, with the participation of some 56% of voters; a second round was held in three constituencies in August. The PDSh and its allies won 80 seats, while the PSSh and allied parties secured 60. Nano resigned as Chairman of the PSSh, but continued to dispute the results. A final OSCE report concluded that the ballot only partly met international standards. On 10 September the Assembly approved a new coalition Government, led by the PDSh, with Berisha as Prime Minister. The Chairman of the PRSh, Fatmir Mediu, became Minister of Defence. In October the Mayor of Tirana, Edi Rama, was elected PSSh Chairman.</p>

                         <p>
            In January 2007 the main political parties reached agreement on electoral reform legislation, and Moisiu rescheduled delayed local government elections for 18 February. However, an OSCE observer mission and the 
            <xr pageref="Y" ref="WB02047.IO.TXT">European Union (EU)</xr>
             concluded that the conduct of the elections had failed to meet international standards. According to official results, the ruling coalition secured 51.1% of the votes cast, and the PSSh-led opposition alliance 42.9%. PSSh candidates retained control of several principal municipalities, including Tirana, where Rama was re-elected Mayor. In April Majko resigned as Secretary-General of the PSSh. Later that month the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Besnik Mustafaj, announced his resignation; he was replaced by Lulzim Basha. The PDSh candidate, Bamir Topi, was elected President by the Assembly on 20 July.
          </p>
                         <p>In March 2008 Mediu resigned as Minister of Defence and three state officials were arrested, after 26 people were killed and some 300 injured in an explosion at an army munitions depot at Gërdec, near Tirana. In June Topi dismissed the Chief of the General Staff, Lt-Gen. Luan Hoxha. (In March 2012 19 former officials, including Luan Hoxha and the former head of Albania’s armaments exports agency, received prison sentences in connection with the explosion at Gërdec.)</p>
                         <p>
            Albania applied for EU membership in April 2009. A number of violent incidents occurred prior to legislative elections held on 28 June, including the killing of a PSSh parliamentary deputy. The PDSh-dominated Aleance e Ndryshimit (Alliance for Change) secured 70 seats, with 46.9% of the votes cast, while the PSSh-dominated Bashkimi për Ndryshi (Unification for Change) coalition won 66 seats, with 45.3%. The PSSh began a boycott of the Assembly, in protest against the rejection of its demands for an investigation into alleged electoral irregularities (also noted by an OSCE observer mission). On 9 September Topi reappointed Berisha as Prime Minister. A new coalition Government, led by the PDSh, and including the LSI and the PRSh, was installed on 17 September. Basha was appointed Minister of the Interior, and Meta became Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs. Mediu (the sole PRSh representative) was returned to the Government as Minister of the Environment; the Supreme Court suspended legal proceedings against him in connection with the explosion at Gërdec, owing to his immunity from prosecution. The PSSh continued to organize demonstrations in protest against the election results, and in November boycotted elections to fill five vacant seats. In January 2010 it was announced that the Parliamentary Assembly of the 
            <xr pageref="Y" ref="CE.IO">Council of Europe (PACE)</xr>
             was to assist Topi in mediating inter-party discussions, and the PSSh parliamentary boycott finally ended in late February.
          </p>
                         <p>After staging a large anti-Government demonstration in Tirana in April 2010, in the following month the PSSh organized a 19-day hunger strike in protest against the Government’s refusal to allow a recount of the votes cast in the legislative elections. In September Meta was appointed Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy, Trade and Energy, replacing Dritan Prifti, who had resigned owing to corruption allegations. Edmond Haxhinasto was appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs. In November 2010 the PSSh resumed the organization of anti-Government protests.</p>
                         <p>In January 2011 Meta resigned from the Government, after footage appeared to show that he had attempted to influence the outcome of a public tender for a hydroelectric plant. Haxhinasto became Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs. On 21 January a mass anti-Government demonstration in Tirana organized by the PSSh led to clashes with police, in which four protesters died; EU officials condemned the excessive use of force. Later in January Miroslav Lajčák, the EU’s special envoy on the political crisis, began to mediate negotiations between the Government and the PSSh. In April Bujar Nishani, hitherto the Minister of Justice, was appointed as Minister of the Interior, replacing Basha, who had resigned to stand as a mayoral candidate for the PDSh. Local government elections were held on 8 May. After a dispute over the mayoral election in Tirana, in late June the KQZ declared that Basha had defeated the incumbent, Rama. Overall, the PSSh-led coalition secured control of 35 municipalities, and the PDSh-led coalition the remaining 30.</p>
                         <p>On 11 June 2012 Nishani was elected President. He was succeeded as Minister of the Interior by Flamur Noka, while Haxhinasto was appointed as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy, Trade and Energy. In July the Assembly approved changes to the electoral code demanded by the European Commission.</p>

                         <heading>The 2013 Legislative Elections</heading>
                         <p>Legislative elections, conducted on 23 June 2013, resulted in victory for a PSSh-led coalition, the Aleanca për Shqipërinë Europiane (ASE—Alliance for a European Albania), which won 57.7% of the votes cast and 84 seats in the Assembly, while the Aleanca për Punësim, Mirëqenie dhe Integrim (Alliance for Employment, Prosperity and Integration) coalition, led by the incumbent PDSh, took 39.4% of the votes and 56 seats. (The LSI, which had withdrawn from the PDSh-led ruling coalition in April, contested the elections as part of the ASE.) International observers generally considered that the electoral process had improved significantly. Later in June Berisha resigned as Chairman of the PDSh; Basha was subsequently elected to the post. At the inaugural session of the Assembly on 10 September, LSI leader Meta was elected Speaker. On 15 September the Assembly approved a new Government, headed by Rama, and principally comprising representatives of the PSSh and the LSI; Niko Peleshi of the PSSh became Deputy Prime Minister.</p>
                         <p>In July 2014 the Assembly approved administrative and territorial reforms to reduce the number of local government units to 61 municipalities (of which three were to be granted special ethnic minority status), in accordance with EU criteria. In August a demonstration took place demanding the resignation of the Governor of the Bank of Albania, Ardian Fullani, after it emerged that some 713m. lekë were missing from the state treasury. Fullani and the bank’s Inspector-General were detained in early September and subsequently removed from office. In February 2015 10 central bank employees were sentenced to terms of imprisonment. On 1 May the Assembly adopted legislation allowing the opening of records compiled by the communist-era secret police, the Sigurimi, and prohibiting its former members from holding public office. At local elections on 21 June the PSSh-led ASE secured control of 45 of the 61 new municipalities, obtaining 53.4% of the votes nationwide. Basha did not seek re-election as Mayor of Tirana, and ASE candidate Erion Veliaj was elected to the post.</p>
                         <p>Meanwhile, efforts proceeded to amend the Constitution in order to reduce political influence over the judicial system. In November 2015 Minister of Justice Nasip Naco of the LSI tendered his resignation. He was replaced by Ylli Manjani, also an LSI member. Later in November agreement was reached between the ruling parties on a constitutional amendment to permanently prohibit those with serious criminal convictions from holding public office, and exclude those found guilty of corruption from public office for a period of 20 years. The amendment was adopted by the Assembly in mid-November. On 8 December a mass anti-Government protest was staged outside the Prime Minister’s office, and a number of violent incidents ensued. Anti-Government protesters again clashed with police near the parliamentary building later in December.</p>
                         <p>
            In early July 2016 the EU demanded that judicial reforms, blocked by the PDSh, be approved by 21 July in order to remove obstacles to the opening of membership negotiations (see 
            <i>Other External Relations</i>
            ). Shortly before the expiry of the deadline, Basha announced that the PDSh had accepted the final draft of a wide-ranging judicial reform bill, and on 22 July it was unanimously adopted by the Assembly. At the end of August a majority in the Assembly approved legislation introducing checks on some 800 judges and prosecutors, thereby implementing constitutional amendments approved in July. The legislation was opposed by the PDSh, however, which appealed to the Constitutional Court in early October. Following a favourable opinion issued by the Venice Commission, the Council of Europe’s advisory body on constitutional law, on 22 December the Constitutional Court ruled that the vetting law adopted in August was in accordance with the Constitution. On 30 January 2017 Rama dismissed Manjani as Minister of Justice. He was replaced by Petrit Vasili, also of the LSI.
          </p>
                         <p>On 18 February 2017 the PDSh began a protest outside the Prime Minister’s office, followed by a boycott of the Assembly, demanding the installation of an interim, non-party Government to ensure that legislative elections, scheduled for 18 June, would be free and fair. In mid-March Rama announced the resignations of four PSSh ministers, including the Minister of Internal Affairs. (They were replaced shortly afterwards, with Fatmir Xhafaj receiving the internal affairs portfolio.) Amid demands for the resignation of Rama, opposition parties failed to register to contest the legislative elections by the early April deadline. Moreover, initial rounds of presidential voting in the legislature, held between 19 and 27 April, were unsuccessful. On 28 April Meta was elected President (despite an ongoing boycott by opposition parties).</p>

                         <p>Following continued EU and US mediation, agreement was reached between Rama and Basha on 18 May 2017, allowing the PDSh to participate in the legislative elections, which were postponed until 25 June. The accord provided for the nomination of opposition representatives to the Government and to official posts with responsibility over the electoral process, and for the establishment of parliamentary commissions to evaluate members of the judiciary. On 22 May the Government was reorganized to include a number of non-party ministers proposed by the opposition. Representatives of the PDSh were also appointed as Chairman of the KQZ and National Ombudsman. The composition of three vetting institutions was approved by the outgoing Assembly on 17 June, after which the process to re-evaluate all judges and prosecutors within a period of five years was initiated.</p>
                         <p>The legislative elections took place, as agreed, on 25 June 2017. Rama’s PSSh secured 48.3% of the votes and a majority in the legislature, with 74 seats, while the PDSh obtained 28.9% of the votes and 43 seats, followed by the LSI with 14.3% of the votes and 19 seats; the Partia Drejtesi Integrim dhe Unitet (PDIU—Party for Justice, Integration and Unity) received three seats (4.8%) and the PSD one seat (1.0%). The participation rate was 46.8% of the electorate. On 24 July Meta was inaugurated (he had been replaced as leader of the LSI by Monika Kryemadhi). Basha was re-elected as leader of the PDSh in late July. On 27 August Rama announced his new Government of PSSh representatives, which was reduced in size to 13 members. Several ministers were retained, and newly elected parliamentary deputy Senida Mesi became Deputy Prime Minister; Majko was appointed to the new post of Minister of State for Diaspora. The new administration was officially approved in mid-September.</p>
                         <p>The ruling parliamentary majority’s election of a new, interim Prosecutor-General, pending the creation of a High Prosecutorial Council, prompted confrontation on 18 December 2017; opposition deputies detonated smoke bombs in an attempt to prevent the parliamentary session from taking place, and violent protests took place outside the building. On 27 October Xhafaj resigned as Minister of Internal Affairs; Rama named his security adviser and former Deputy Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, Sandër Lleshaj, to succeed him, although Meta refused to endorse the nomination until Lleshaj agreed to relinquish his military designation.</p>
                         <p>In mid-December 2018 the head of the Constitutional Court was removed, as part of the ongoing vetting process. By that time the Constitutional Court was unable to function, with eight of its nine members having resigned or been removed from their posts, while the Supreme Court was also severely depleted. On 28 December Rama announced the dismissal of eight government ministers. Longstanding PSSh parliamentary deputy Erion Braçe replaced Mesi as Deputy Prime Minister, while Arben Ahmetaj was replaced as Minister of Finance and the Economy by senior public official Anila Denaj. After Meta refused to approve the Prime Minister’s nomination to the post of Minister of European and Foreign Affairs, in January 2019 Rama announced that he would assume the post.</p>
                         <p>Following an anti-Government protest in Tirana on 16 February 2019, when demonstrators attacked the offices of Prime Minister Rama, Basha announced the withdrawal of the main opposition from the Assembly, on the grounds that it had been elected illegitimately. PDSh and LSI parliamentary deputies resigned on 21 February. Meanwhile, the opposition-led campaign of protests intensified, with frequent escalations into violence.</p>
                         <p>
            On 8 June 2019 President Meta issued a decree postponing local elections, due to take place at the end of the month, until October, in support of demands by opposition parties. However, Rama rejected the presidential decree as being in violation of the Constitution, and in a parliamentary session five days later, 100 of the 110 attending deputies voted to declare it invalid. Rama subsequently announced that the local elections would take place in June, as originally scheduled, and announced his intention to launch impeachment proceedings against Meta. Despite the opposition’s refusal to participate, the local elections took place on 30 June. In 31 of the 61 municipalities, the mayoral candidates of the PSSh-led ASE stood unopposed, and only around 23% of the total electorate participated in the polls. 
            <!--https://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/albania/429230?download=true p. 29-->
             According to the official results, the ASE secured 94.1% of local council seats and 60 of the 61 mayoral posts. In a final report issued in early September, an OSCE electoral mission noted that, owing to the opposition boycott, voters lacked political choice, and that no progress had been made with regard to previous observer recommendations.

                         <p>On 26 November 2019 an earthquake struck north-western Albania, killing 51 people and injuring around 2,000. The authorities subsequently arrested around 60 construction workers and officials suspected of violating standards on safety during the construction of buildings that had collapsed in the earthquake. (However, by early 2022 only one of those charged had been convicted, receiving a suspended prison sentence.)</p>
                         <p>Meanwhile, as part of the ongoing judicial reforms, on 5 December 2019 the Assembly elected a new Prosecutor-General, Olsian Çela, from nominations presented by the High Prosecutorial Council, established one year earlier. In mid-December the Assembly approved `anti-defamation’ legislative amendments, providing for penalties against online media outlets accused of defamation or infringing privacy, and attracting criticism from international media organizations, In January 2020 Meta issued a presidential veto against them. In June the Venice Commission concluded that the proposed laws threatened freedom of political expression. (In October 2022 the Government announced that the controversial laws would be formally withdrawn.)</p>
                         <p>The first cases of COVID-19 in Albania were detected on 8 March 2020, amid an escalating global pandemic. Over the course of the month, the authorities adopted restrictions to prevent transmission, and eventually declared a national state of emergency on 24 March. Many lockdown measures were lifted from 18 May, although some restrictions, including on mass gatherings, remained in place.</p>
                         <p>On 5 June 2020 a new Political Council, comprising the ruling party together with parliamentary and non-parliamentary opposition parties, reached agreement on reforms to the electoral code to ensure the independence of the electoral administration and to restructure the KQZ in compliance with recommendations by the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) of the OSCE. The amendments were adopted by the Assembly on 23 July. (However, subsequent amendments to the Constitution and to the electoral code, adopted by the Assembly on 30 July and 5 October, respectively, attracted criticism from the Venice Commission and the ODIHR, owing to the limited timeframe for their adoption.) On 27 July the Assembly voted not to impeach President Meta over his failed attempt to postpone the local elections in 2019.</p>
                         <p>The authorities reintroduced wide-ranging COVID-19 restrictions, including a night-time curfew, with effect from 11 November 2020. On 8 December a police officer shot dead a man who was in violation of the curfew in Tirana, precipitating violent protests. Minister of Internal Affairs Lleshaj resigned from office, but Rama refused to dismiss Director of Police Ardi Veliu, whose removal had been demanded by protesters; violent protests continued for several days in major towns in defiance of the ban on public gatherings imposed in response to the pandemic. Lleshaj was succeeded by Bledar Çuçi, hitherto the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, on 17 December. Later that month the Constitutional Court resumed its functions, after Meta approved the candidacy of a sixth new judge. Rama effected a minor government reorganization on 29 December, appointing the hitherto Minister of Defence, Olta Xhaçka, as Minister of European and Foreign Affairs, while former deputy premier Niko Peleshi assumed the defence portfolio. The night-time curfew was finally lifted on 2 March 2022.</p>

                         <heading>The 2021 Legislative Elections</heading>
                         <p>Legislative elections took place on 25 April 2021; the PSSh again emerged as the leading party, securing 48.7% of the votes and 74 seats. The PDSh competed at the head of an electoral alliance, the Aleanca për Ndryshim (Alliance for Change), which attracted 39.4% of the votes and won 59 seats, while the LSI obtained 6.8% of the votes and four seats and the PSD won 2.3% of the votes and three seats. The rate of participation by the electorate was 46.3%.</p>
                         <p>At an extraordinary session of the Assembly on 9 June 2021, a motion was adopted to impeach President Meta, on the grounds that he had violated the Constitution by openly criticizing the PSSh during the electoral campaign, thereby encouraging political instability. Impeachment was supported by 104 votes, exceeding the 93-vote threshold required to remove Meta from office. However, the motion was subject to approval by the Constitutional Court, which on 17 February 2022 ruled that Meta had not acted in violation of the Constitution.</p>
                         <p>Rama formed a post-election Government on 2 September 2021. Notably, former Minister of Finance and the Economy Ahmetaj became a Deputy Prime Minister. The new Government received a parliamentary vote of confidence on 17 September.</p>
                         <p>Meanwhile, divisions within the PDSh escalated, as supporters of former PDSh leader Berisha sought to remove the longstanding party Chairman, Basha, following a dispute between the two political figures. Basha had removed Berisha from the party’s parliamentary group in September 2021, after he was designated `persona non grata’ by the US Government in May; the USA accused him of corruption during his tenure as Prime Minister. At an assembly of supporters convened by Berisha in December, an amended PDSh party statute was adopted and Berisha’s expulsion by Basha was annulled. In early January 2022 police dispersed hundreds of protesters, led by Berisha, who attempted to seize the PDSh headquarters. Berisha was subsequently expelled from the party, along with a number of supporters. In March Basha delegated the party leadership to Enkelejd Alibeaj, after the PDSh performed poorly in six mayoral by-elections. Nevertheless, on 22 May Berisha was elected leader of the party by his supporters.</p>
                         <p>Three initial rounds of presidential voting in the legislature, held between 16 and 30 May 2022, were unsuccessful, owing to the parties’ failure to reach agreement on a candidate to succeed Meta, who was not proposed for a second term. For the fourth round on 4 June, in which a simple majority (71 deputies) was sufficient to elect a President (rather than the three-fifths’ majority required in earlier rounds), the PSSh nominated Bajram Begaj, hitherto Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces. Begaj, who resigned his military position upon nomination, secured 78 votes, and was duly elected as the new President. He was sworn in on 24 July.</p>
                         <p>In late July 2022 Rama removed Ahmetaj from his ministerial post, replacing him as Deputy Prime Minister with Belinda Balluku, who also remained Minister for Infrastructure and Energy. Rama subsequently dismissed Ahmetaj as head of the regional party in Vlorë. In the same month Meta’s LSI was renamed the Partia e Lirisë (PL—Freedom Party).</p>
                         <p>
            As the divisions in the PDSh remained unresolved, in March 2023 Berisha’s supporters, who were refused permission to contest forthcoming local elections as representatives of the party, formed a coalition with Meta’s PL and two smaller organizations, known as Bashkë Fitojmë (Together We Win). At the local elections, which took place on 14 May, 
            <!--https://ndiqparate.al/?p=19610&lang=en-->
             the PSSh secured the mayoralties in 52 municipalities, the Bashkë Fitojmë coalition in seven and an ethnic Greek party in one (the results in Rrogozhinë were annulled); a voter turnout of only 38.2% was recorded. The official PDSh under the leadership of Alibeaj failed to secure any mayoral posts. On 17 May Alibeaj officially resigned from all party posts. In late July Basha was elected to replace Alibeaj. The party’s General Secretary, Gazment Bardhi, was expelled in September by Basha, after having attempted to reconcile his party faction with that led by Berisha.

                         <p>Meanwhile, a number of the approximately 235 judges and prosecutors who had been removed under the vetting process between February 2018 and June 2023 had successfully challenged their dismissals at the European Court of Human Rights. On 10 July 2023 the head of the PSSh parliamentary group, Taulant Balla, was appointed Minister of Internal Affairs, replacing Çuçi. In mid-July the Assembly voted in favour of a request filed by the Special Structure against Corruption and Organized Crime (an independent judicial entity formed in late 2019) for the arrest of former deputy premier and incumbent parliamentary deputy Ahmetaj, who was suspected of corruption and money laundering; however, Ahmetaj was reported to have left the country and taken refuge in the United Kingdom shortly beforehand. Also in July, following EU objections, the PSSh decided to postpone approval of proposed changes to two electoral laws that were intended to ban prospective parliamentary candidates suspected of having collaborated with the communist-era Sigurimi secret service.</p>
                         <p>
            Following several alleged corruption cases involving senior public officials, in early September 2023 Rama reorganized the Government, dismissing five ministers. Xhaçka was removed from her position as Minister of European and Foreign Affairs, following opposition demands and reports that her husband had benefited from investments in public property in the south of Albania. She was succeeded by Igli Hasani, a former senior OSCE official. The dismissal of Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Frida Krifca followed the European Commission’s announcement in July of the temporary suspension of its agricultural and rural development funding to Albania, pending the outcome of an investigation into irregularities in disbursements; Anila Denaj returned to government as her successor. Delina Ibrahimaj was replaced as Minister of Finance and the Economy by Ervin Mete. The Ministers of Health and of Education were also dismissed. A new Ministry of State for Local Government was establis
            
            hed, while the Ministry of State for Standards and Services was dissolved. Berisha was reported to have been placed under house arrest in late December, amid allegations of corruption relating to his time in office as Prime Minister during 2005-09.
            <!--https://www.tiranatimes.com/?p=154240-->
             In January 2024 Rama announced further government restructuring, creating a Ministry of the Economy, Culture and Innovation, headed by the hitherto General Director of the Directorate of Road Transport Services, Blendi Gonxhja (with Mete remaining as Minister of Finance), and a Ministry of State for Public Administration and Anti-Corruption, headed by Adea Pirdeni, a former deputy minister.

            Albania’s relations with Greece have frequently been strained, particularly over the status of the Greek minority in Albania. Tensions increased in April 1994, following a border incident in which two Albanian guards were killed. In September five prominent members of the ethnic Greek organization OMONIA received custodial sentences following charges including espionage and the illegal possession of weapons, prompting Greece to submit form
            
            al protests to the UN and the EU. One defendant was pardoned in December, after Greece withdrew a veto on EU aid to Albania. In February 1995 the four remaining prisoners were re­leased. However, in March 1996 a co-operation agreement was signed between the two nations. A new border crossing between Albania and Greece was opened in May 1999. In December 2013 the Governments of Albania and Greece announced their willingness to renegotiate demarcation of the Ionian Sea maritime border, following the rejection by Albania’s Constitutional Court of an agreement signed in 2009. However, in October 2018 Albania’s relations with Greece were strained after an ethnic Greek man was killed by Albanian police during an exchange of fire in the predominantly ethnic Greek border village of Bularat, prompting a formal complaint from the Greek Government. Greek Minister of Foreign Affairs Nikos Dendias visited Tirana in October 2020, when it was agreed to refer the main outstanding issue of delineation of the maritime border to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands. However, a further dispute between Albania and Greece developed following the arrest by the Albanian authorities of a Greek minority opposition representative, Fredi Bejleri, on charges of vote buying prior to the local elections in May 2023. Despite pressure from the Greek Government, Albanian courts refused to release Bejleri, who had narrowly been elected Mayor in the southern municipality of Himarë, pending his trial.

                         <p>
            Albania’s relations with Serbia (then part of Yugoslavia) deteriorated sharply from 1989, when many ethnic Albanian demonstrators were killed during unrest in the predominantly ethnic Albanian province of Kosovo. In early 1998 Albania condemned Serbian military activity against the ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo, while clashes were reported on the Albanian border with that country between Serbian troops and members of the paramilitary Ushtria Çlirimtare e Kosovës (UÇK—Kosovo Liberation Army). By mid-1998 some 10,000 ethnic Albanian refugees had fled to north­ern Albania. The Albanian Government expressed support for the 
            <xr pageref="Y" ref="NATO.IO">North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)</xr>
             aerial bombardment of Yugoslavia, which began in March 1999, and allowed Albania’s air and sea facilities to be used for NATO operations. NATO troops were dispatched to Albania to support humanitarian aid operations for the Kosovo refugee population. Following the deployment of a NATO-led peacekeeping Kosovo Force (KFOR) under the terms of a peace agreement in June, refugees returned to Kosovo from Albania. A NATO 1,200-member contingent, Communications Zone West (COMMZ-W), was established in Albania to maintain civil order and support the KFOR mission in Kosovo. In June 2002 COMMZ-W was dissolved, and a NATO headquarters was established in Tirana. Albania and Yugoslavia restored diplomatic relations in January 2001.
          </p>
                         <p>Albania recognized the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia (now North Macedonia) as an inde­pend­ent state in 1993. The Albanian Government remained concerned at the perceived oppression of the ethnic Albanian minority there; conflict between government forces and ethnic Albanian rebels in 2001 had prompted large numbers of ethnic Albanian civilians to take refuge in Albania. Albanian President Topi and other government officials visited North Macedonia’s capital, Skopje, in April 2012, shortly after a further incident of ethnic violence in the country. In November an agreement was signed on the opening of a new border crossing between the two states.</p>
                         <p>The unilateral declaration of independence by Kosovo on 17 February 2008 prompted public celebrations in Tirana, and Albania officially recognized Kosovo as a sovereign state. On 19 February the Council of Ministers approved the establishment of diplomatic relations with Kosovo at ambassadorial level. In October 2009 Berisha made an official visit to Kosovo’s capital, Prishtina, where bilateral co-operation agreements were signed. In January 2014 an agreement on strategic co-operation and partnership was signed between Albania and Kosovo. In February 2015 the Albanian and Kosovan authorities established a joint border and customs office. Prime Minister Rama visited Kosovo for discussions in September 2021, subsequently urging Serbia to cease its `show of force’ at the border with Kosovo (amid increased tensions between Kosovo and Serbia). At an intergovernmental meeting attended by Rama and his Kosovo counterpart, Albin Kurti, in the Albanian city of Elbasan in November, agreements were signed to remove border controls for vehicles travelling between Albania and Kosovo, to relax checks on goods and to introduce five-year residence and employment permits for their respective citizens. However, amid a tense political impasse in Kosovo, in mid-2023 relations between Rama and Kurti deteriorated, after the Albanian Prime Minister increased pressure on Kosovo to establish an Association of Serb-Majority Municipalities, presenting a proposal to France and Germany for its creation. Rama cancelled a joint Albania-Kosovo government meeting scheduled for June, at which agreements were to have been signed, and Kurti refused to meet Rama when he visited Prishtina on 6 July.</p>
                         <p>In October 2014 tensions between Albania and Serbia increased after a football match in the Serbian capital, Belgrade, degenerated into violence, precipitated by a drone flight over the stadium, promoting an irredentist `Greater Albania’. A planned visit by Prime Minister Rama to Serbia, the first by an Albanian premier in almost 70 years, was postponed, but finally took place in November. The Serbian Government formally protested to Albania in January 2015, after an image promoting `Greater Albania’ was displayed at Rama’s residence. However, Aleksandar Vučić made an official visit to Tirana (the first to Albania by a Serbian premier) in May. On 10 October 2019 Rama, Vučić and the Prime Minister of North Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, meeting in the Serbian city of Novi Sad, signed a declaration of intent to establish a free movement zone between their respective states. Meeting in Tirana in December 2021, Rama, Vučić and Zaev signed agreements easing trade restrictions and increasing co-operation, as part of the `Open Balkan’ initiative. Further co-operation was agreed at Open Balkan summits in Ohrid, North Macedonia, in June 2022 and in Belgrade in September. However, at the beginning of July 2023 Rama unexpectedly announced that the Open Balkan initiative had fulfilled its mission, indicating an intention to focus on Albania’s progress towards EU membership (see below).</p>

                         <p>The gradual relaxation of Albania’s isolationist policies culmin­ated in 1990 in a declaration of its intention to establish good relations with all countries, irrespective of their social system. In July Albania and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) formally agreed to restore diplomatic relations (suspended since 1961). Diplomatic relations between Albania and the USA (suspended since 1946) were re-established in March 1991.</p>
                         <p>
            Negotiations on the signature of a Stabilization and Associ­ation Agreement (SAA) with the EU commenced in January 2003, and it was officially signed between the Albanian Government and the EU on 12 June 2006. Albania became a NATO member on 1 April 2009. The SAA entered into effect in the same month, and on 28 April Albania submitted a formal application for EU membership. The Albanian Government adopted electoral and other reform legislation during 2012, in accordance with stipulations by the European Commission. Although the Commission recommended that Albania be awarded EU candidate status in October, the EU General Affairs Council withheld approval, citing the need for further judicial and public administration reforms. On 24 June 2014 the EU General Affairs Council confirmed that it had formally granted Albania the status of a candidate for eventual membership of the Union. Albania adopted judicial reforms in 2016, in accordance with European Commission requirements (see 
            <i>Approval of Judicial Reforms</i>
            ), and in November received a conditional recommendation for the opening of accession negotiations. In mid-April 2018 the European Commission recommended that accession negotiations be opened, on the basis of conditions already fulfilled, and as part of the EU’s planned engagement with the Western Balkans. However, following opposition from France and the Netherlands, a decision was postponed until 2019.
          </p>
                         <p>
            The European Council, meeting on 17-18 October 2019, again failed to approve the opening of accession negotiations with Albania and North Macedonia. After the European Commission presented revised enlargement procedures in February 2020 and released favourable reports on Albania and North Macedonia, in late March the Council of the EU agreed to open accession negotiations with both countries. However, in November the Council failed to approve a negotiating framework for Albania and North Macedonia, principally owing to a veto introduced by Bulgaria against North Macedonia over issues of national identity, although it was also considered that further required reforms on the part of Albania (notably relating to the functionality of the Constitutional Court and amendments to media legislation) remained unfulfilled. With the EU accession application of Albania continuing to be assessed together with that of North Macedonia, the process was stalled while Bulgaria maintained its veto on the latter country. However, following French mediation the new Bulgarian administration agreed to abandon the veto in June 2022, and on 19 July the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Josep Borrell Fontelles, announced the launch of the accession process with both North Macedonia and Albania. On 6 December Tirana hosted an EU-Western Balkans summit, the first to be held in the Western Balkan region. In October 2023 Albania also hosted a Berlin Process summit (under an intergovernmental co-operation initiative created in 2014), which was attended by senior representatives of Western Balkan and EU countries. However, following an ongoing dispute between Greece and Albania (see 
            <i>Regional Relations</i>
            ), in early November 2023 the Greek Government refused to sign a joint letter from EU member states to the EU Commission urging the start of negotiations with Albania on the first five chapters of the accession process. 
          </p>
                         <p>During a visit to Rome, Italy, on 6 November 2023, Rama signed a memorandum of understanding with his Italian counterpart, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, under which Albania agreed to host two centres under Italian jurisdiction for the accommodation of thousands of irregular migrants to Italy who had been rescued at sea, pending the processing of their asylum applications. In addition to immediate protests from Albanian opposition parties and a coalition of civil society organizations, the bilateral five-year agreement drew strong objections on human rights grounds from the Council of Europe. However, a draft law based on the agreement was approved by the Albanian Government in mid-November. Following an opposition challenge, in late January 2024 the Constitutional Court narrowly ruled that the agreement did not violate Albanian law and sovereignty, and it was ratified by the Assembly on 22 February (with opposition deputies abstaining).</p>
                         <p>Following the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, the Albanian Minister of Foreign Affairs announced that Albania was to join wide-ranging sanctions imposed by the EU against Russia. The assets of over 650 people, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, were to be frozen, Russian aircraft were to be banned from Albania’s air space, restrictions were to be imposed on trade with Russia in principal areas, and Russians subject to the EU sanctions were to be prevented from entering Albania. In early March Albania’s honorary consulate in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv was destroyed by Russian artillery. Two days later the Russian Government added Albania (together with Montenegro and North Macedonia) to its list of `enemy’ states.</p>
                         <p>In December 2018 the Albanian Government expelled the Iranian ambassador, together with another Iranian diplomat, owing to suspicions that they were involved in activities that endangered the country’s security. The Iranian foreign ministry denounced the decision. In October 2019 the Albanian police announced the discovery of an Iranian paramilitary network, which had reportedly been planning attacks against members of an Iranian resistance movement, Mujahideen al-Khalq (MEK), in exile in Albania. In mid-January 2020 Albania announced the expulsion of two further Iranian diplomats, who were accused of activity that threatened its national security. On 15 July 2022 a major cyber-attack targeted government services and disrupted public internet services (following a similar attack in May). A group known as Homeland Justice claimed responsibility for the attack, and subsequently published stolen documents and data. Albanian and US investigations linked the July attack to the Iranian Government, and in early September Albania formally suspended relations with Iran, expelling the Iranian ambassador and recalling its envoy from Iran. A further large-scale cyber-attack, again attributed to Iran, followed on 9 September.</p>

        Under the Constitution adopted in November 1998, legislative power is vested in the unicameral Kuvendi Shqipërisë (Assembly of Albania). The Assembly, which is elected for a term of four years, com­prises 140 deputies, 100 of whom are directly elected in single-member constituencies. Parties receiving 2.5% or more of the votes cast, and party coalitions obtaining 4.0% or more in the first round of voting, are allocated further deputies in proportion to the number of votes secured, on the basis of multi-name lists of parties or party coalitions. The President of the Republic is head of state, and is elected by the Assembly for a term of five years. Executive authority is held by the Council of Ministers, which is led by the Prime Minister as head of government. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President and appoints a Council of Ministers, which is presented for approval to the Assembly. Judicial power is exercised by the High Court, as well as by the Courts of Appeal and the Courts of First Instance. The Chairman and members of the High Court are nominated by the President of the Republic, subject to the approval of the Assembly, for a term of nine years. For the purposes of local government, Albania is divided into 12 counties (
        <i>qarqe</i>
        —also called prefectures), 61 municipalities and 309 communes. The representative organs of the basic units of local government are councils, which are elected by direct election for a period of three years. The Council of Ministers appoints a Prefect as its representative in each of the 12 counties.

According to chain-linking methodologies, GDP increased by 4.9% in 2022.</p>
               <p id="AL.IS.54">Agriculture (including hunting and forestry) contributed 21.3% of GDP in 2022, according to provisional official figures, and (including hunting, forestry and fishing) engaged 33.8% of the employed labour force in 2021. The principal crops are maize, tomatoes, watermelons, potatoes, wheat and grapes. During 2013-22, according to estimates by the World Bank, agricultural GDP grew, in real terms, at an average annual rate of 1.2%; sectoral GDP increased by 1.8% in 2021 and by 0.1% in 2022. According to chain-linking methodologies, GDP increased by 0.1% in 2022.</p>
               <p id="AL.IS.55">Industry (comprising mining, utilities, manufacturing and construction) contributed 24.5% of GDP in 2022, according to provisional official figures, and engaged an estimated 21.9% of the employed labour force in 2021. Principal contributors to industrial output include mining, energy generation and food processing. During 2013-22, according to estimates by the World Bank, industrial GDP increased, in real terms, at an average annual rate of 3.3%; industrial GDP increased by 13.6% in 2021 and by 7.7% in 2022.</p>
               <p id="AL.IS.56">Mining and quarrying, together with utilities, contributed 5.9% of GDP in 2022, according to provisional official figures, and the sector (again, including utilities) engaged some 2.6% of the employed labour force in 2021. Albania is one of the world’s largest producers of chromite (chromium ore), possessing Europe’s only significant reserves. Annual chromium ore production was estimated at 1,288,000 metric tons in 2019 (compared with 587,000 tons in 1991). Albania has petroleum resources and its own refining facilities, and there has been foreign interest in the explor­ation of both onshore and offshore reserves. Proven reserves of petroleum amounted to some 168m. barrels in 2018; production of crude petroleum increased to some 7.4m. barrels in 2019, compared with 5.0m. barrels in 2011. During 2013-21, according to estimates by the United Nations (UN), GDP in the mining and quarrying and utilities sector increased, in real terms, at an average annual rate of 0.5%; the GDP of mining and quarrying and utilities decreased by 12.8% in 2020, but increased by 10.5% in 2021.</p>

               <p id="AL.IS.57">The manufacturing sector contributed 7.5% of GDP in 2022, according to provisional official figures, and engaged some 11.2% of the employed labour force in 2021. The sector is largely based on the processing of building materials, agricultural products, minerals and chemicals.

               <p id="AL.IS.59">Services contributed 54.2% of GDP in 2022, according to provisional official figures, and engaged 44.3% of the employed labour force in 2021. According to estimates by the World Bank, during 2013-22 the GDP of the services sector increased, in real terms, at an average annual rate of 3.9%; the GDP of the sector increased by 6.2% in 2022.</p>
               <p id="AL.IS.60">In 2022 Albania recorded a visible merchandise trade deficit of US&#160;$4,466.6m., and there was a deficit of $1,116.7m. on the current account of the balance of payments. In 2022 the principal source of imports (accounting for some 21.7% of the total) was Italy; other major suppliers were Türkiye, the People’s Republic of China, Greece and Germany. Italy was also the principal market for exports (accounting for 43.2% of the total); Kosovo, Germany and Greece were also important purchasers. The principal exports in 2022 were mineral products, iron, steel and other base metals, textiles and textile articles, footwear and accessories, and machinery and electrical equipment.

               <p id="AL.IS.61">
        In 2022, according to official budget figures, Albania’s overall budget deficit was 78,300m. lekë. General government gross debt was 1,401,612m. lekë in 2022, equivalent to 65.5% of GDP. In that year Albania’s total external debt was US&#160;$11,086m., of which $5,292m. was public and publicly guaranteed debt. The cost of servicing long-term public and publicly guaranteed debt and repayments to the 
        <xr id="IO-UN-2193" pageref="N">International Monetary Fund (IMF)</xr>
         was equivalent to 14.5% of the value of exports of goods, services and income (excluding workers’ remittances). According to official figures, during 2013-22 the average annual rate of inflation was 2.3%; consumer prices increased by 2.0% in 2021 and by 6.7% in 2022. The rate of unemployment was 10.9% in 2022.

        In March 2020 the 
        <xr pageref="Y" ref="WB02047.IO.TXT">European Union (EU)</xr>
         reached agreement on the opening of accession negotiations with Albania (and North Macedonia), while requiring the Albanian Government fully to implement substantive reforms; however, the process of formally commencing membership talks was repeatedly postponed (see 
        <i>Other External Relations</i>
        ). Meanwhile, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020 the Government announced relief measures. In April the IMF approved US&#160;$190.5m. in emergency support under its Rapid Financing Instrument to combat the economic impact of COVID-19. Due to weaker revenues from tourism, together with reduced remittances, external demand and investment, GDP contracted by 3.5% in 2020. In August 2021 construction work commenced on the first electricity interconnector between Albania and North Macedonia, as part of an initiative supported by the EU and the 
        <xr pageref="Y" ref="EBRD.IO">European Bank for Reconstruction and Development</xr>
         to establish an East-West electricity transmission corridor. In October the Government declared an emergency energy situation, owing to domestic power shortages and high import prices. However, a reduction in pandemic-related restrictions in Europe assisted recovery in the tourism and construction sectors during 2021, and GDP growth in Albania rebounded to 8.9% in that year. Despite a global energy crisis and other adverse factors resulting from the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine, including an increased cost of living, GDP growth in 2022 was 4.9%, as the tourism industry showed continued recovery from the disruption of the pandemic. The annual rate of consumer price inflation, which reached 6.7% in 2022, had been successfully contained to around 4.0% by late 2023, following a series of interest rate rises effected by the central bank during 2022-23. However, a sharp appreciation in the national currency, the lek, against the euro and other national currencies, which was partly attributed to the increase in tourism revenue and higher remittances, caused significant concerns among farmers and exporting companies, which claimed substantial losses in profits. Real GDP was projected by the IMF to expand by 3.6% in 2023 and by 3.3% in 2024, generated by private consumption, and by continued strength in tourist and construction activity.
