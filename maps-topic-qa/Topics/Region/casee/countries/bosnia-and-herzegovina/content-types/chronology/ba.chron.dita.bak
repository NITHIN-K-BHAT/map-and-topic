        Elections to the state Presidency took place together with polls to the Presidency of Republika Srpska, the state and entity legislatures, and the Federation cantonal assemblies. Denis Bećirović of the SDP BiH was elected as the Bosniak member of the state Presidency with 57.4% of the votes, defeating Izetbegović of the SDA (37.3%), while the Croat member, Komšić of the DF, securing 55.8%, defeated Borjana Krišto, deputy leader of the HDZ BiH (44.2%). Cvijanović of the SNSD (an ally of Dodik), succeeded him as the Serb member of the Presidency, with 51.7% of the votes, defeating Šarović of the SDS (35.5%). In the state House of Representatives the leading parties were the SDA, which retained nine seats, the SNSD (six), the SDP BiH (five), and an HDZ BiH-led coalition (four). In the Federation House of Representatives the leading parties remained the SDA (24.4% of the votes and 26 seats), and the SDP BiH and the HDZ BiH-led coalition, each with 15 seats, and 13.5% and 13.4% of the votes, respectively. In the elections to the Republika Srpska People’s Assembly, the SNSD remained dominant, with 34.6% of the votes and 29 seats, while the SDS received 15.0% and 13 seats. In the Republika Srpska presidential election, SNSD candidate Dodik secured 47.1% of the votes, securing victory over Jelena Trivić of the PDP (representing a PDP-SDS alliance), with 42.8%. On the same day, after the polls closed, High Representative Schmidt announced significant reforms to election law and to the Constitution in the Federation, with the aim, 
        <i>inter alia</i>
         of preventing the obstruction of legislative appointments and other processes. The changes notably provided for an increase in the size of the Federation House of Peoples from 58 to 80 members.
