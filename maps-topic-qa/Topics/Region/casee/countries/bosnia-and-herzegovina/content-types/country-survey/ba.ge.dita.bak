          <p id="BA.GEOG.1">Bosnia and Herzegovina is a mountainous territory with only about 20&#160;km (12 miles) of coastline, which is of little maritime significance. Roughly triangular in shape, the country juts into Croatia, which forms its western border (extending from north-west to south-east, along the Dinaric Alps) and its northern border. Serbia lies to the east (there is a short border with the province of Vojvodina in the north-east) and Montenegro to the south-east. The total area of the country is 51,209 sq&#160;km (19,772 sq&#160;miles).</p>
          <p id="BA.GEOG.2">The ancient province of Bosnia is roughly the territory bounded by the Sava, Drina and Una rivers. Along the Sava, which forms the northern border, there are fertile lowlands. The chief town, and the country’s capital, is Sarajevo, which is in the south, near the headwaters of the River Bosna (from which the province acquired its name). Herzegovina (only 18% of the total area) occupies the south of the country, with the Dalmatian coastal strip, in Croatia, to the south-west and Montenegro to the south-east. Its chief town is Mostar. Most of Herzegovina is mountainous and infertile, but there are fruitful valleys.</p>
          <p id="BA.GEOG.3">Under the terms of the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, agreed at Dayton, Ohio, USA, in 1995, most of the country comprises two entities: the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska. The Federation occupies the west and centre of the country, its territory tapering north-eastwards, with a road linking it to the eastern enclave of Goražde; there is also a northern exclave, Posavina Canton, located around the town of Orašje. Republika Srpska comprises most of the remaining 49% of the country, its territory concentrated along the eastern border, including southern (or `Old’) Herzegovina, and in the north of the country, around Banja Luka and the Bosnian Krajina. The district of Brčko, in the north-east, forms a part of neither entity.</p>

          <heading>Climate</heading>
          <p id="BA.GEOG.4">The largely mountainous territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina has a continental climate, although this is moderated with proximity to the coast. The hinterland of the Dalmatian coast (itself in Croatia) and the territory around Bosnia and Herzegovina’s small coastal town of Neum has a Mediterranean climate.</p>

          <heading>Population</heading>
          <p id="BA.GEOG.5">According to projections by the United Nations, the population numbered 3,210,848 at mid-2023, giving a density of 62.7 per sq&#160;km. The Bosnian Muslims (Bosniaks) are a Slavic people, who adopted Sunni Islam during Ottoman rule. In 1961 they were accorded the status of an ethnic group, being recognized as a Yugoslav national unit in 1968, and they were the largest single group in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1991 they comprised 43.5% of the total population. At that time Serbs accounted for 31.2% of the population and Croats for 17.4%. At the census of 2013, Bosniaks accounted for 50.1% of the population, Serbs 30.8% and Croats 15.4%. Religious affiliation is roughly equated with ethnicity. The Croats and Serbs are Christians, the former adhering to the Roman Catholic Christians, and the latter to the Eastern Orthodox Church. The mutually comprehensible languages of Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian (all of which were referred to as variants of Serbo-Croatian during the Yugoslav period) have equal status in both the Federation and Republika Srpska; Bosnian and Croatian are written in the Latin script, while Serbian is more commonly and traditionally written in Cyrillic.</p>
          <p id="BA.GEOG.6">
      Sarajevo is the country’s largest city, with a population of 275,524, according to results of the census of 2013. It is the capital of the country and of the Federation
      
       and, 
      <i>de jure</i>
      , of Republika Srpska. The Serb-inhabited outskirts of the city are administered separately, within Republika Srpska, as the city of Istočno (East) Sarajevo, which had a population of 61,516. The country’s second city, Banja Luka (with a population of 185,042), is the de facto capital of Republika Srpska. Mostar (with an estimated population of 105,797, with large populations of both Bosniaks and Croats, is the chief town in the main area of Croat settlement. Other important towns in the Federation include Tuzla, in the north-east (with a population of 110,979) and Zenica (110,663). Important towns in Republika Srpska include: Bijeljina (with a population of 107,715), in the north-east; Prijedor (89,397), in the Bosnian Krajina; and Doboj (71,441).
