          <heading>Introduction</heading>
          <p>The General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina (GFA), signed in Paris, France, on 14 December 1995 by representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Yugoslavia (comprising Serbia and Montenegro), marked a formal end to the war. The principles of the Agreement had been reached in November in Dayton, Ohio, USA (becoming known as the Dayton accords), after more than three years of bitter conflict and the repeated failure of previous international efforts to broker a peace. These failures had been the result not only of the fundamentally irreconcilable war aims of the leaderships of the three countries and the secessionist Bosnian Serbs and Croats, but also of major policy disagreements between the USA and its European allies. Consequently, the GFA was a peace agreement of the lowest common denominator, designed to end the fighting and bring the international crisis to an end at almost any price. The constitutional arrangement bequeathed to Bosnia and Herzegovina was inherently unworkable and left most major questions unresolved. After 1995, political changes at both the global and regional level changed the constellation of forces at work in Bosnia and Herzegovina, appearing to resuscitate an apparently moribund state and offer some hope for a brighter future for the country. However, developments since the mid-2000s have led to a renewed deterioration of the state and a worsening of relations between the politicians representing its constituent nationalities, prompting increasing concerns for its long-term future.</p>

          <heading>Origins of the Paradoxes of the GFA</heading>
          <p>At the global level, the positive changes in Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1995 and 2006 represented the culmination of a process that had begun before Dayton. The failure of international diplomacy to bring an end to the Bosnian war before late 1995 was the result of a number of factors: the belief of the United Kingdom and France that the Serbs had achieved a military victory and that any peace agreement would have to recognize this fact; the unwillingness of the UK and France to permit the employment of military force to reverse Serb gains or to coerce the Serbs to accept international peace proposals; and the reluctance of the US Administration of President Bill Clinton seriously to challenge the British-French policy. During 1995, however, the military recovery of both Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina increasingly exposed the illusory character of Serb preponderance, while in France, François Mitterrand was succeeded as President by Jacques Chirac, who supported the use of force against the Bosnian Serbs. Finally, Clinton’s policy of non-intervention in the Balkans collapsed under the weight of congressional opposition, provoked in large part by outrage at the massacre at the `safe area’ of Srebrenica in July. A radical change in Western policy ensued, resulting in air strikes by North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) forces against Bosnian Serb forces and, under US leadership, the virtual forcing of the republican Government and secessionist Bosnian Serbs and Croats to the negotiating table and the imposition of the Dayton accords.</p>
          <p>
      The GFA was, therefore, the product of a Western policy in a state of flux. Its combination of contradictory provisions represented an uneasy synthesis of pre-1995 policies and the more assertive policy heralded by the NATO air strikes of August and September. While Bosnian territorial integrity was preserved 
      <i>de jure</i>
      , most state powers were, in practice, devolved to the two entities, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska. 
    </p>
          <p>Foremost among the entities’ rights was `the right to establish special parallel relationships with neighbouring states consistent with the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina’. The implication was that relations between the Federation and Croatia on the one hand, and between Republika Srpska and Yugoslavia on the other, would become, in practice, more important than their nominal relations with the state authorities, or with each other.</p>
          <p>
      The GFA, therefore, appeared to constitute an attempt to reconcile the 
      <i>de jure</i>
       unity of Bosnia and Herzegovina with its de facto partition, a compromise between the stance of the congressional majority in the USA, which favoured the former, and the position of certain European powers, notably the UK, which tacitly accepted the latter. The GFA represented the culmination of the incremental progress made by the Clinton Administration towards this compromise, beginning with the Washington Agreement of March 1994. That accord had established the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a union of 10 cantons, in which power would be shared by the Bosniaks (Muslims) and Croats. Although this Agreement initially envisaged that the Serbs might in future join the Federation, this prospect was abandoned when the `Contact Group’ plan of July (drawn up by a negotiating forum comprising representatives from France, Germany, the Russian Federation, the UK and the USA) envisaged the partition of Bosnia and Herzegovina on the basis of a 51%:49% division of territory between the Federation and Republika Srpska.
    </p>
          <p>The Federation thus became one of two entities recognized by the GFA, with the result that the new Bosnian constitutional arrangement contained a striking peculiarity: two of the three Bosnian constituent peoples recognized by the GFA were to share a single entity, whereas the third, the Serbs, were to have an entity to themselves. This would be a source of discontent among Bosnian Croats, forced as they were to share power with the more numerous Bosniaks. The discrepancy neatly symbolized the ambiguity of the international community’s policy: a division of Bosnia and Herzegovina into three entities would have marked its effective partition; the inclusion of the Serbs within the Federation would have marked the country’s effective reunification; the two-entity policy seemed to do neither.</p>

          <heading>External Catalysts to Change</heading>
          <p>The paradoxes of the GFA meant that Bosnia and Herzegovina would be pulled simultaneously towards both division and integration. However, there was one overriding determinant: whatever the disagreements in the West over the country’s ultimate destiny, there was a consensus in the immediate post-Dayton period that the international community should never again allow tensions there to escalate out of control. Thus, the impulse to integrate Bosnia and Herzegovina slowly came to predominate over the impulse for partition. Just as the failure of a policy of ending the war through appeasing the Serbs gave way to the more assertive policy that resulted in the GFA, so the problems created by the Agreement in turn resulted in an increasingly more interventionist Western policy that resulted in the gradual strengthening of the central state authorities at the expense of the entities.</p>
          <p>There were a number of external catalysts to this evolution in Western policy. In May 1997 Tony Blair succeeded John Major as British Prime Minister. Like Chirac, Blair reversed the Balkan policy of his predecessor, adopting a much stronger position against Serbian intransigence. In March 1999 NATO troops intervened to oust Serbian forces from the predominantly ethnic Albanian province of Kosovo (Kosova), and in May the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), based in The Hague, Netherlands, indicted Slobodan Milošević, the Serbian leader, for war crimes.</p>
          <p>Croatian President Franjo Tuđman died in December 1999, removing one of the principal obstructions to further Bosnian integration. Tuđman’s death was followed by the electoral defeat of his Hrvatska Demokratska Zajednica (HDZ—Croatian Democratic Union) in parliamentary and presidential elections held in early 2000, after which Croatia abandoned attempts to partition Bosnia and Herzegovina and repudiated its `special relationship’ with the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The return to power of the HDZ in November 2003 did not lead to a return to Tuđman’s policy. The new HDZ Prime Minister, Ivo Sanader, made it clear that Croatia’s ambitions to join the European Union (EU) and NATO would not be sacrificed for the sake of Bosnian Croat irredentism. Meanwhile, in October 2000 Milošević was ousted from power in Serbia amid popular demonstrations that followed a disputed presidential election, resulting in a Serbian regime that, while remaining committed to traditional nationalist goals, was desirous of good relations with the West. Although Vojislav Koštunica of the Demokratska Stranka Srbije (Democratic Party of Serbia), as the Serbian Prime Minister from early 2004, retained an irredentist perspective with regard to Republika Srpska, this represented merely a weak echo of Milošević’s `Greater Serbia’ project.</p>
          <p>The attacks by militant Islamists against the USA of 11 September 2001, and the implication of high-ranking Bosnian Serb officials in illegal arms-trading with Iraq in October 2002, made the international community increasingly unwilling to tolerate the presence of rogue elements operating in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The increasing strength and confidence of the expanding and centralizing EU and the unwillingness of the US Administration of George W. Bush to tolerate regional troublemakers combined for a while to produce a more active international administration in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Consequently, Bosnia and Herzegovina showed signs of becoming, if not a healthy member of the international system, then a state that was semi-viable and stable. Yet from 2006, with the perceived decline in status of the Office of the High Representative (OHR) and the rise of the administration in Republika Srpska of Milorad Dodik and his Savez Nezavisnih Socijaldemokrata (SNSD—Alliance of Independent Social Democrats), the process went into reverse.</p>
     </gen-section>
     <gen-section print-style="COLUMN" sllink="SLSDOC" slsdocrf="GEN-SECTREF">
          <heading>The Changing Role of the Office of the High Representative</heading>
          <p>Since the republican Bosnian authorities were emasculated by the GFA, it was the OHR that was initially the principal integrating factor. The High Representative, as originally envisioned by the GFA, was effectively an overseer, whose role was `to facilitate the Parties’ own efforts and to mobilize and, as appropriate, co-ordinate the activities of the organizations and agencies involved in the civilian aspects of the peace settlement’. The High Representative governs Bosnia and Herzegovina on behalf of the Peace Implementation Council (PIC), the body representing the 55 states and agencies that were mandated to direct the peace process. The impression that the High Representative would have no more than a supervisory role was reinforced by the choice as the first High Representative of Carl Bildt, a Swedish former Prime Minister widely associated with the pre-Dayton policy. He was succeeded by Carlos Westendorp in June 1997.</p>
          <p>Before 2006 successive High Representatives, nevertheless, adopted increasingly stronger measures to promote integration. In December 1997 a conference of the PIC was held in Bonn, Germany, at which real authority—the so-called `Bonn powers’—was conferred on the High Representative, enabling him to dismiss officials who were deemed to be obstructing the administration, and to impose legislation, in defiance, if necessary, of the Bosnian authorities. In early 1998 the High Representative introduced a new flag for Bosnia and Herzegovina, which lacked nationalist connotations for any of the Bosnian peoples. In March 1999 Westendorp dismissed the nationalist President of Republika Srpska, Nikola Poplasen. In March 2000 international mediators ruled that the disputed town of Brčko, which sits astride the `corridor’ between two parts of Republika Srpska, would become a neutral district, separate from both entities, thereby making any eventual secession of the Republic more problematic. In July the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina resolved that all three of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s peoples should be constituent throughout the entire country, with the Bosniak and foreign members of the Constitutional Court outvoting the Serb and Croat members to approve this resolution. In response to the new right of non-Croats to participate in the election by the Federation legislature of Croat representatives to the Dom Naroda (House of Peoples—the upper chamber of the state legislature), the Hrvatska Demokratska Zajednica Bosne i Hercegovine (HDZ BiH—Croatian Democratic Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina) embarked upon a rebellion against the organs of the Federation. In March 2001 High Representative Wolfgang Petritsch (appointed in August 1999) responded by dismissing Ante Jelavić of that party from the state Presidency, and removed several other HDZ BiH officials, seizing the party’s financial assets.</p>
          <p>It was the High Representative appointed in May 2002, former British politician Lord Ashdown, who presided over the most sustained effort to reduce the autonomy of the entities and strengthen the state institutions. (Ashdown was concurrently appointed to a new position, of EU Special Representative to Bosnia and Herzegovina, one that until 2011 was also held by his successors.) In April 2003, in response to the discovery of illegal arms-trading with Iraq by Bosnian Serb officials, the OHR abolished Republika Srpska’s Supreme Defence Council and removed all references to statehood from the entity’s Constitution. In September representatives of all three constituent peoples agreed to establish a state Ministry of Defence and unified military command. The head of the NATO-led peacekeeping force in the country helped to negotiate the agreement, which made possible eventual Bosnian membership of NATO’s `Partnership for Peace’ programme of military co-operation and, in theory, full membership of NATO.</p>
          <p>In December 2003 legislation was adopted that enabled the entities’ separate customs administrations to be replaced by a state Indirect Taxation Authority. In January 2004 Ashdown issued a decree providing for the reunification of Mostar (hitherto divided between Croat- and Bosniak-controlled municipalities). In March the state Constitutional Court ruled that 13 towns and municipalities in Republika Srpska that had been given new Serb names or prefixes since 1992 should have their non-ethnic names reinstated. In June 2004 a unified Security and Intelligence Agency was established, a measure that was linked to Ashdown’s purge of Bosnian Serb officials implicated in assisting suspected war criminals to evade capture. The creation of a state-level police force was attempted, through the establishment of a State Investigation and Protection Agency in July. In October 2005 both entities finally endorsed proposals for the reform of the police service to establish a single structure. The two entities’ armies were brought under a unified command in January 2006.</p>
          <p>The trend towards an increasingly firm stance by successive High Representatives was reversed after 31 January 2006, when Ashdown was succeeded by a German politician, Christian Schwarz-Schilling. As High Representative, Ashdown had attracted criticism, both for his alleged authoritarianism and for his failure fully to confront the obstructionist elements hampering Bosnian integration. In contrast, Schwarz-Schilling announced that during his tenure he intended to prepare the country’s elected leaders to assume full responsibility for the country, while his own authority was to be limited by the avoidance of the use of the `Bonn Powers’. Moreover, the reduction of the number of EU Force (EUFOR Operation Althea) troops to 2,500 by mid-2007, compared with 30,000 in 1999, left the High Representative with limited personnel to enforce his policies.</p>
          <p>Negotiations held in November 2005, when the leaders of eight political parties met in Brussels, Belgium, to discuss US-inspired reforms aimed at strengthening the common state, gave little grounds for optimism. At a meeting held in Washington, DC, USA, later that month, the party leaders, under intense pressure, signed a generic declaration of readiness to proceed with unspecified constitutional changes. Although the parties reached agreement on a number of constitutional reforms in March 2006, the latter were rejected by the legislature in April.</p>
          <p>In April 2005 the European Parliament approved a resolution demanding a revision of the Dayton accords to reintegrate Bosnia and Herzegovina. In October EU ministers responsible for foreign affairs reacted to Republika Srpska’s obstruction of planned police reform by postponing the possible start of negotiations on a Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) with the country. The EU had become increasingly weary of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s need for financial and political assistance, as Kosovo became a greater priority. In this context, EU demands for reform had a diminishing impact.</p>
          <p>The failure of the OHR to provide strong backing to the reform process further emphasized its impotence in the face of local obstructiveness. Schwarz-Schilling’s announcement that he would leave the position in June 2007 was testimony to international dissatisfaction at his performance. The EU aimed to abolish the post in favour of that of EU Special Representative. Nevertheless, this proved impossible to carry out, and the OHR’s mandate has been repeatedly extended.</p>
          <p>Miroslav Lajčák, the Slovakian diplomat who became High Representative in July 2007, attempted to play a more interventionist role. On 30 November Bosniak, Serb and Croat leaders accepted Lajčák’s proposal for reducing the ethnic groups’ powers of veto over the state-level authorities, after he threatened to impose the measures unilaterally. This paved the way for Bosnia and Herzegovina’s initialling of an SAA with the EU on 4 December, and the SAA’s signature on 16 June 2008. This was accompanied, in April, by the belated adoption by the state legislature of reforms that would establish a more unified police force through the creation of co-ordinating and supervising bodies linking the two entity forces. However, the Republika Srpska Government resisted pressure for fuller police integration.</p>
          <p>When Valentin Inzko succeeded Lajčák as High Representative in March 2009, of the PIC’s seven objectives and conditions for OHR closure, only three had been met: fiscal stability; entrenchment of the rule of law; and signature of the SAA. A further objective was partially fulfilled on the day that Inzko assumed office, when the parliament of Bosnia and Herzegovina adopted a constitutional amendment formally incorporating Brčko District into the country’s Constitution. Yet, at its meeting in November, the PIC Steering Board continued to express `serious concern’ at the failure of Bosnia and Herzegovina to fulfil the PIC’s objectives and conditions, particularly with regard to the distribution of state and defence property. The latter was finally reached by leaders of the main political parties in March 2012, thereby belatedly fulfilling the necessary terms for the closure of the now-moribund OHR.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the Government of Republika Srpska resisted an attempt by the OHR in September 2009 to impose nine new laws. In October the OHR was formally excluded from attempts instigated by the USA and EU to broker a new constitutional settlement in the so-called Butmir process (see below). In December Republika Srpska’s parliament rejected the OHR’s extension of the mandates of the international judges and prosecutors of the War Crimes Chamber of the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In May 2011, when Catherine Ashton, Vice-President of the European Commission and the EU High Representative for the Union of Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, visited Republika Srpska, in an attempt to persuade the entity’s leadership to abandon a proposed referendum on the legality of the Court and Prosecutor’s Office of Bosnia and Herzegovina (see below), she bypassed the OHR. Moreover, in March 2012 Dodik announced that he would present a lawsuit against Inzko once the latter’s mandate as High Representative had expired. The OHR became an increasingly powerless body, particularly after the appointment, in September 2011, of the Danish diplomat, Peter Sørensen, as the EU Special Representative, and the separation of the post from that of the High Representative.</p>

          <heading>Conflicting Impulses Towards Unity and Division</heading>
          <p>The Bosniak, Serb and Croat political elites of Bosnia and Herzegovina have been pulled in two directions since 1995. Although they have come under pressure from the international community to pursue more moderate policies, their electorates have tended to reward politicians who appear to adopt a tough stance with regard to patriotic issues.</p>
          <p>Thus, for many years, the impulse towards peace and unity in Bosnia and Herzegovina came from outside, while the impulse towards conflict and disunity came from within. This may appear to be an undemocratic conclusion, yet in a country where some 2.7m. of the pre-war population of about 4.4m. were displaced during the war, with only about 1m. of these having returned, and where the demographic character of large areas has thus been radically altered, the very definition of democracy is drawn into question. A large proportion of the Bosnian political class enjoys electoral success only because its constituencies have been purged of members of other ethnic groups who would not vote for them.</p>
          <p>One qualification should be made to this picture: whereas voters in Republika Srpska and in the Croat-controlled areas of the Federation tended to support politicians opposed to integration, the identification of Bosniaks (who none the less predominantly continued to vote for nationalist parties) with the idea of Bosnian unity meant that they were receptive to efforts by the international community towards integration, something that even the main Bosniak nationalist party, the Stranka Demokratske Akcije (SDA—Party of Democratic Action), had to take into account. There are also sectors of the population that have tended to reject both nationalism and partition: the Serb and Croat communities in Bosniak-controlled areas, the Bosniak and Serb communities of Croat-controlled areas, and members of mixed marriages, numbers of all of which were slowly but steadily augmented by refugee returns.</p>
          <p>The nationalist parties remained unable to overcome their mutual differences to the point where they could establish a functioning Bosnian political order, even when goodwill apparently existed. This was highlighted by an agreement signed in Prud, in the municipality of Odžak, in November 2008, when Dodik, Sulejman Tihić and Dragan Čović, the leaders of the SNSD, SDA and HDZ BiH, respectively, announced that they had reached an agreement on the political and legal restructuring of the country. In January 2009 the parties to the agreement elaborated upon it, announcing that Bosnia and Herzegovina was to be a sovereign, democratic, social, secular and decentralized state with three levels of government, of which the middle layer was to consist of four units. Yet, with the parties differing on their interpretations of these principles, and with their commitment to the agreement never more than lukewarm at best, the process resulted in failure.</p>
          <p>The failed Prud process was followed by the attempt of a US and EU delegation to mediate discussions on constitutional reforms, conducted in October 2009 at Camp Butmir near Sarajevo, the capital. The proposed reforms included the strengthening of the state-level Council of Ministers and establishment of the post of Prime Minister; the House of Peoples was to lose its legislative role, and the Presidency was to be elected by the House of Peoples rather than by the electorate. The overall result was to be the establishment of an effectively unicameral parliamentary system, with most executive power to be concentrated in the Council of Ministers. Once again, the initiative ended in failure, as Dodik refused to accept any reduction of the autonomous competencies of Republika Srpska. The Bosniak side, too, was dissatisfied with the Butmir proposals, which would have preserved entity voting, which it regarded as the principal obstacle to the effective functioning of the Bosnian central state.</p>
          <p>Ultimately, the GFA does not enable either the proponents of full partition or of complete reintegration to achieve their goals. In order for the system of entities to have been viable, there would have needed to have been three entities—one for each of the country’s constituent peoples—with full autonomy. However, this would have finalized the partition of Bosnia and Herzegovina, ensured the failure of repatriation and the arrest of war criminals, and thus violated principal elements of the peace settlement. Consequently, it is the central Bosnian state that has formed the foundation for international reconstruction efforts. Given that the autonomy of the entities obstructs the functioning of the central state, it can be argued that the entities are the principal barriers to stability and reconstruction. Just as the central state is weakened by the entities, so the Federation is weakened, and its budget drained, by the cantons. The multiple and conflicting layers of bureaucracy represent an enormous burden to an already struggling economy, one that will have to be removed before the country can begin to function properly.</p>
          <p>The constitutional order established by the GFA also presents an impediment to EU accession: unlike Serbia, Montenegro and North Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina still has not been granted candidate status. In November 2010, the European Commission granted visa-free travel to the EU to the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina. NATO granted a Membership Action Plan (MAP) to Bosnia and Herzegovina in April 2010. However, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), in a ruling of 22 December 2009 (case of Sejdić and Finci v. Bosnia and Herzegovina), found Bosnia and Herzegovina to be in breach of provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights prohibiting discrimination, owing to the constitutional ban on members of minority ethnic groups (i.e. Bosnian citizens who do not define themselves as ethnic Bosniaks, Serbs or Croats) from seeking election to the Presidency or the House of Peoples. In response to the failure of the parliamentary parties to agree on constitutional changes necessitated by this ruling, in April 2013 Štefan Füle, the EU Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy, cancelled the third meeting of the high-level dialogue between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the EU, at which Bosnia and Herzegovina’s EU accession was to have been discussed. In response to the impasse, the foreign ministers of Germany and the UK, Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Philip Hammond, announced a joint initiative on 5 November 2014 for the more rapid association of Bosnia and Herzegovina with the EU. This would require the political leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina to commit to essential political and economic reforms, and was intended to end the indefinite stalling of the accession process. The initiative was adopted by the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 29 January 2015 and approved by the parliament of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 23 February; in response, the Council of the EU on 15 March approved the entry into force of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s SAA, which took place on 1 June. Bosnia and Herzegovina formally submitted its EU membership application on 15 February 2016.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, relations worsened within the Federation between the politicians representing Bosniaks and Croats, respectively. The re-election in October 2010 of the candidate of the Socijal-demokratska Partija Bosne i Hercegovine (SDP BiH—Social Democratic Party of Bosnia and Herzegovina), Željko Komšić, as the Croat member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, largely with Bosniak votes and in defiance of the wishes of most Croat voters, was followed by the formation in March 2011 of a federation Government that excluded the two principal Croat parties—the HDZ BiH and the Hrvatska Demokratska Zajednica 1990 (HDZ 1990—Croatian Democratic Union 1990)—prompting a new secessionist drive by the latter. The HDZ BiH and HDZ 1990 refused to send delegates to the Dom Naroda Federacije (Federation House of Peoples), demanded the establishment of a third, Croat entity and, together with eight smaller Croat parties, established a `Croat National Assembly’ in Mostar in April. This resulted in a constitutional crisis, in which the Central Election Commission supported the principal Croat parties and declared the newly constituted federation authorities illegitimate, but was then overruled by the High Representative.</p>
          <p>Moreover, for nearly 15 months following the elections of October 2010, party leaders were unable to agree on the formation of a government at state level. The SNSD, the HDZ BiH and HDZ 1990 insisted that the main posts be filled on the basis of the principle of rotation between parties representing the three constituent peoples, while the SDP BiH, under Zlatko Lagumdžija, as a nominally multi-ethnic party, asserted its right to appoint Croat and Serb members to the Council of Ministers, despite its own predominantly Bosniak membership. The impasse was ended by an agreement in December, whereby Vjekoslav Bevanda of the HDZ BiH became Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Lagumdžija became Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>
          <p>Politics at the federation and state levels were subsequently thrown into turmoil by the SDP BiH forming alliances with the principal Croat and Serb nationalist parties. In June 2012 it reached an agreement with the HDZ BiH for the reconstruction of the Federation and state governments, resulting in a power struggle with other parties in the Federation Government, which were supported by the President of the Federation, Živko Budimir. In October the SDP BiH reached an agreement with the SNSD that was criticized by SDA leader Tihić as tantamount to `dissolving Bosnia and Herzegovina’ and replacing it with a `union of entities’. The agreement sought to impose the parliamentary appointment of prosecutors, thereby reducing the independence of the judiciary, and to divide income from the state electric power distribution company between the entities. The elections of October 2014 marked a severe defeat for the SDP BiH in both the state and Federation legislatures. This marked the eclipse of the party that had long been principally representative of Bosnian citizens, particularly Bosniaks, who rejected the organization of parties along ethnic lines. Municipal elections on 2 October 2016 further consolidated the power of the principal nationalist parties. In the Federation, the SDA won six fewer mayoralties than in the previous elections in 2012, but, with 30, remained easily the party with the higher number; the HDZ BiH won an additional seven mayoral offices, thenceforth holding 18; while the representation of the SDP BiH fell by two, to eight mayoralties. In Republika Srpska, the SNSD won an additional 10 mayoralties to reach 30, while those held by the now more moderate SDS fell from 32 to 16. Symbolically, a Serb was elected Mayor of Srebrenica for the first time since the war: Mladen Grujičić, who was supported by all the Serb parties and who refused to accept that the 1995 massacre was an act of genocide.</p>
          <p>At a general election held on 7 October 2018, the SDA and SNSD were once more the leading parties, with their candidates, Šefik Džaferović and Dodik, elected as the Bosniak and Serb members of the collective Presidency, respectively. However, the HDZ BiH candidate for the Croat member, the incumbent Čović, was decisively defeated by Komšić, who now represented the Demokratska Fronta Bosne i Hercegovine (DF—Democratic Front of Bosnia and Herzegovina), a non-nationalist party that had emerged from the SDP BiH. In the elections to the state Pred­stavnički Dom/Zastupnički Dom (House of Representatives), the SDA was placed first, with nine seats, followed by the SNSD, with six seats, the SDP BiH, with five seats, and a coalition of Croat parties led by the HDZ BiH, also with five seats. In the Federation House of Representatives, the SDA remained the dominant party, with 27 seats, followed by the SDP BiH and the HDZ BiH-led coalition, with 16 seats each. In Republika Srpska, the SNSD’s candidate, Željka Cvijanović, won the election for the Presidency to replace the outgoing Dodik; the SNSD was also first-placed in the elections to the entity’s legislature, the Narodna Skupština Republike Srpske (Republika Srpska People’s Assembly), securing 28 seats, although far short of an absolute majority, while a coalition led by the SDS came second, with 16 seats.</p>
          <p>These results confirmed the grip that the three principal nationalist parties held over their respective electorates, but also the difficulty faced by the HDZ BiH, as the principal party of the smallest of the three constituent groups, in achieving representation equivalent to its Bosniak and Serb counterparts. The grip of the nationalist parties resulted in continued political paralysis. Following the 2018 elections, disagreements over Bosnia and Herzegovina’s accession to NATO blocked the formation of a new administration for over a year. However, on 19 November 2019 the state Presidency reached agreement on the formation of a new government, under the SNSD’s Zoran Tegeltija, who took office as Chairman of the Council of Ministers on 23 December; the Government comprised a coalition of the SNSD, the SDA, the HDZ BiH, the DF and the Demokratski Narodni Savez (DNS—Democratic People’s Alliance). The deadlock had led to the temporary suspension of Bosnia and Herzegovina from the work of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in June, owing to its failure to appoint new representatives. Subsequently, municipal elections held on 15 November 2020 were welcomed as marking a setback to the dominance of the SDA and SNSD over the Bosniak and Serb electorates, respectively, since the opposition parties defeated their incumbent mayors in Sarajevo and Banja Luka, the largest cities in each of the entities. However, the triumph in Sarajevo of the opposition known as the Quartet, comprising the SDP BiH, Narod i Pravda (NiP—People and Justice), Naša Stranka (NS—Our Party) and the Nezavisna Bosanskohercegovačka Lista (Independent Bosnian-Herzegovinian List), was followed by a furore when the SDP BiH’s Quartet partners in the Sarajevo City Council failed to support its choice of mayor, the extremely popular Bogić Bogičević (who was famous for having, as Bosnia and Herzegovina’s member of the Yugoslav Federal Presidency, opposed an attempt by the Yugoslav army command to carry out an effective coup in March 1991, despite himself being a Serb). The rejection of Bogičević’s candidacy was widely regarded as a failure of the supposedly non-nationalist Quartet to support non-Bosniak candidates. The Sarajevo City Council instead elected Benjamina Karić of the SDP BiH, a Bosniak, on 8 April 2021, although her candidacy had the merit of improving the severe under-representation of women in Bosnian municipal politics—only four of the country’s 425 mayors were women. Meanwhile, municipal elections were for the first time in 12 years also conducted in Mostar, following an agreement on power-sharing between the SDA and the HDZ BiH on 17 June 2020. This permitted the HDZ BiH’s candidate, Mario Kordić, to be narrowly elected Mayor of Mostar on 15 February 2021, in another success for the nationalist parties.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, Bosnia and Herzegovina’s NATO accession remained in question owing to Serb opposition. In February 2019 the country’s Annual National Programme (ANP)—a precondition for the activation of its MAP—was taken off the Council of Ministers’ session agenda for the fourth consecutive time, amid opposition from Serb ministers. In late December, following the agreement on the formation of a new Government, a `Reform Programme’ relating to Bosnia and Herzegovina’s relationship to NATO was finally released by the Presidency, but this did not formally amount to an ANP, and Dodik, now the Serb member of the state Presidency, claimed that it did not prejudice the question of whether the country would join NATO. With the opposition in Republika Srpska accusing the entity’s Government of betraying its opposition to membership, feelings ran so high that the Republika Srpska Minister of Internal Affairs, Dragan Lukač, physically assaulted opposition representative Draško Stanivuković during the People’s Assembly debate on the issue on 23 December.</p>
          <p>On 7 February 2020 the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with the support of its three foreign members, ruled that publicly owned agricultural land in Republika Srpska was the property of the state, rather than of the entity. This prompted a walkout by Serb representatives from state-level institutions and Dodik, with the backing of the Republika Srpska People’s Assembly, demanded that unless the foreign judges were expelled within 60 days, the entity would initiate a new referendum on independence. The Republika Srpska People’s Assembly also demanded in mid-February that the inter-entity boundary line be clearly demarcated, something that Federation Prime Minister Fadil Novalić rejected.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, in Croatia, the inauguration of Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović of the HDZ as President in February 2015, followed by the establishment of an HDZ-led Government under Andrej Plenković in October 2016, catalysed demands among Croats both in Croatia and in Bosnia and Herzegovina for a Croat entity. Čović, then the Chairman and Croat member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in December 2017 described such an entity as a `real possibility’. In May 2018 police in the Croat-majority Herzegovina-Neretva Canton turned back a convoy of migrants travelling from Sarajevo Canton—a severe violation of Bosnian law that guarantees internal freedom of movement. Komšić’s victory over Čović in the 2018 general election further heightened frustration among Bosnian Croat nationalists, who perceived the victory as illegitimate because it was achieved partly with Bosniak votes. In mid-May 2020 a mass held at the Catholic cathedral in Sarajevo by Cardinal Vinko Puljić, to commemorate prisoners of war and civilians of the Second World War `Independent State of Croatia’ who were killed by Yugoslav Partisans following the Bleiburg repatriations of 1945, was sponsored by Croatia but denounced by many Bosnian bodies and individuals, particularly Bosniaks.</p>
          <p>The HDZ BiH intensified its efforts to ensure that its candidate for the Croat member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina could not in future be defeated by Komšić or by any other candidate through non-Croat votes. This demand received support from representatives of both the EU and the USA. However, negotiations on electoral reform in Sarajevo, held under the mediation of the head of the EU’s External Action Service, Angelina Eichhorst, and US ambassador to Bosnia and Herzegovina Michael Murphy, concluded in March 2022 without result, after SDA leader Bakir Izetbegović rejected the HDZ BiH’s proposals. This prompted the HDZ BiH to threaten to boycott the general election scheduled for 2 October. However, the HDZ BiH’s attempt to block funding for the election was overturned by High Representative Christian Schmidt (see below) in early June when he ordered the state to finance it and allocated KM&#160;12.5m. to the electoral commission to prepare and organize the polls. The USA on 6 June imposed sanctions on Marinko Čavara, the HDZ BiH President of the Federation. Nevertheless, the issue of electoral reform has become a popular cause for the nationalist right in Croatia.</p>
          <p>The form of reintegration pursued by successive High Representatives is one that appears better in theory than it does in practice. In Bosnia and Herzegovina as a whole, a clear majority of refugees have not yet been repatriated and probably never will be—the official figure of about 1m. returnees included those who merely returned temporarily to reclaim their property before selling it and re-emigrating. Political life continues to be dominated for the most part by mono-ethnic parties; inter-ethnic goodwill and co-existence are weak; the education system is, for the most part, ethnically segregated; the economy remains stagnant, disabled by the oversized state bureaucracy; and corruption is widespread. For example, in December 2019 the Prosecutor’s Office of Bosnia and Herzegovina charged former Minister of Security Dragan Mektić and three others with abuse of position over the implementation of an inter-state project on cross-border co-operation. Asim Sarajlić, the deputy leader of the SDA, was forced to resign in early March 2020, after evidence emerged that implicated him in corrupt activities.</p>
          <p>In this context, ordinary Bosnians will continue to put their faith in informal patronage networks that avoid official organs and channels, or that use these organs and channels to benefit insiders. This means, for example, that members of ethnic groups that form minorities under particular administrations, or members of the majority ethnic groups who do not possess the right connections, will continue to receive a disproportionately small share of the local economic benefits and experience poor treatment from local officials. The absence of any genuine democratic mandate, or public respect or confidence, means that any strengthening of central institutions could not be expected to attract real support from the population. Much of the true power in society is held by the gangster class, which possesses strong powers of patronage through its control of local businesses and which is, it has been suggested, the only functioning multi-ethnic institution in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The judiciary, moreover, remains corrupted and susceptible to pressure by local criminals. One of the paradoxes of contemporary Bosnia and Herzegovina is the fact that even though the prospect of Serbian or Croatian annexation of parts of the country is perhaps as distant as it has ever been and Bosnian independence has been formally established, patriotic identification with Bosnia and Herzegovina among most Bosnian Serbs and Croats is weaker than ever.</p>
          <p>For all the failures of Bosnian reintegration, frequently expressed concerns about the potential growth of Islamic fundamentalism in the country have largely failed to be realized, and the international jihadi movement had only limited success in becoming established among the Bosniak community, the political life of whom remains firmly secular. Although there have been a few instances of Islamist-motivated violence, including attacks in Bugojno in 2010, in Zvornik, and in Rajlovac, on the outskirts of Sarajevo, in 2015, which in each case killed a police officer, the Bosniak practice of Islam remains overwhelmingly of a moderate nature.</p>

          <heading>Successes and Failures of the ICTY</heading>
          <p>Despite the ICTY’s inauspicious beginnings, there were notable convictions for genocide-related charges, in relation to the Srebrenica massacre, of Bosnian Serb officers Radislav Krstić, Vujadin Popović, Ljubiša Beara and Drago Nikolić. These convictions established legally that genocide had occurred at Srebrenica in July 1995. In December 2012 the conviction for genocide of Zdravko Tolimir, the Assistant Commander of Intelligence and Security of the Bosnian Serb army, further established that the Muslim population of eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina as a whole, not just of Srebrenica, had been targeted for genocide, and that the genocidal act had extended to Žepa, as well as to Srebrenica. The conviction of both Karadžić and Mladić on 10 of 11 counts, including that of genocide in Srebrenica, in March 2016 and November 2017, respectively, was arguably the ICTY prosecution’s greatest achievement, although the Tribunal’s failure to convict them for genocide in municipalities outside of Srebrenica, and Karadžić’s initial sentence of 40 years rather than of life imprisonment, have been criticized. However, Karadžić’s sentence was subsequently increased to a life term by the Appeals Chamber in March 2019. Bosnian Serb officers Stanislav Galić and Dragomir Milošević received lengthy sentences for crimes carried out during the siege of Sarajevo, while other Serb soldiers and officials have been convicted for crimes committed in concentration camps. As a result of proceedings at the ICTY for war crimes carried out at Foča, the crime of rape was in 2001 established as a crime against humanity under international law. Other notable convictions include those of wartime Republika Srpska Vice-President Biljana Plavšić and parliamentary Chairman Momčilo Krajišnik, and the Croat perpetrators of the Ahmići and Stupni Do massacres of Bosniaks in April and October 1993, respectively. In May 2013 five senior Bosnian Croat wartime officials, including Jadranko Prlić, former President of the Croat Council of Defence (Hrvatsko Vijeće Obrane—HVO) and Prime Minister of the wartime `Croat Republic of Herceg-Bosna’, and Milivoj Petković, former HVO Chief of Staff, were convicted and received sentences of between 10 and 25 years; the sentences were upheld on appeal in November 2017. Further convictions of relatively low-ranking war criminals were achieved by the War Crimes Chamber of Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
          <p>By the mid-2000s Republika Srpska, under pressure from the OHR, had begun to make tentative progress towards co-operation with the ICTY. In January 2005 a former deputy commander of a detention camp, Savo Todović, was transferred to the Tribunal. Subsequently, four prominent Bosnian Serb war crimes suspects surrendered to the ICTY during February-March. In December Republika Srpska President Dragan Čavić demanded that the two most prominent indicted war criminals, Karadžić and former Republika Srpska Chief of Staff Ratko Mladić, surrender to the ICTY, marking a symbolic break with the previous Bosnian Serb stance. In June 2006 Dragan Zelenović became the first indictee to be extradited from Republika Srpska to The Hague. Although the entity authorities had not engaged in the forcible arrest of those unwilling to surrender to the ICTY, this represented significant progress from the authorities’ previous absolute resistance to co-operation with the Tribunal. With Karadžić’s arrest in Belgrade in July 2008, followed by Mladić’s arrest in Lazarevo, Vojvodina (also in Serbia), in May 2011, no Bosnian Serb indictees remained at large. Since Bosnian Serbs comprised the majority of ICTY indictees, this represented a significant achievement on the part of the international community in fulfilling the GFA provisions for the arrest of war criminals.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, this achievement was tarnished by the failure of the ICTY to indict several of those accused of being principal orchestrators of the war (including Blagoje Adžić, the Bosnian former Chief of Staff of the Yugoslav People’s Army). The death in March 2006 of Milošević, the only top-ranking official of Serbia or Montenegro to be indicted for war crimes in Bosnia and Herzegovina, meant that the prime instigators of the conflict had essentially gone unpunished. The ICTY also attracted criticism for awarding lenient sentences. Bosnian Croat commander Gen. Tihomir Blaskić, who had been sentenced to 45 years’ imprisonment in 2000, was released after his sentence was reduced to nine years on appeal in 2004. This was followed by the acquittal in 2005 of former Bosnian Army Chief of Staff Sefer Halilović; the sentencing in 2006 of Bosnian Croat commander Ivica Rajić, held responsible for the massacre of inhabitants of the village of Stupni Do in 1993, to only 12 years’ imprisonment; the acquittal on appeal in 2007 of Bosnian Serb commander Vidoje Blagojević for complicity in genocide; the full acquittal on appeal in July 2008 of Bosnian Army commander Naser Orić; the full acquittal on appeal in 2013 of former Yugoslav Army Chief of Staff Momčilo Perišić, who had previously been sentenced to 27 years’ imprisonment for aiding and abetting Bosnian Serb war crimes at Sarajevo and Srebrenica, as well as for Serb war crimes in Croatia; the acquittal in 2013 of former chief of the State Security Service of Serbia Jovica Stanišić and former chief of Special Forces Franko Simatović (who were then both sentenced in 2021 to only 12 years in prison following their retrial by the UN’s International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals); and the sentencing of the former leader of the extreme nationalist Srpska Radikalna Stranka (Serbian Radical Party), Vojislav Šešelj, to only 10 years in prison in 2018. Nevertheless, a distinction must be made between the ICTY’s inconsistent record in achieving justice for the victims of the war and its undoubtedly positive record in promoting regional political progress. Insofar as Bosnia and Herzegovina is concerned, the Tribunal’s indictments and arrests prepared the way for the emergence of a newer, less compromised and less intransigent generation of politicians.</p>
          <p>The Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina also had a mixed record in its efforts at prosecuting war crimes suspects. Established on 12 November 2000 by the High Representative and sanctioned on 2 July 2002 by the Parliament of Bosnia and Herzegovina, it is a hybrid domestic and international court that includes international judges and prosecutors. Its War Crimes Chamber, with a jurisdiction limited to `lower- and intermediate-rank accused’, began work on 9 March 2005. It found seven low-ranking Serbs guilty of genocide in relation to Srebrenica on 29 July 2008 (one of whom was subsequently acquitted on appeal). Other genocide convictions followed, and hundreds of suspects were successfully prosecuted by the Chamber for lesser war crimes. However, a July 2013 ruling of the ECHR determined that suspects had been tried under the wrong criminal code, paving the way for the release and theoretical retrial of hundreds of detainees. On 23 October the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina ruled that all six of the remaining genocide convicts from the July 2008 decision should be freed pending retrial. Furthermore, in April 2014 Serge Brammertz, Chief Prosecutor of the ICTY, expressed his dissatisfaction at the Chamber’s lack of progress in the cases of 44 individuals transferred to it from the ICTY. Both inside and outside Bosnia and Herzegovina, the perception remains that the war crimes courts have often failed to meet expectations.</p>

          <heading>Popular Protests</heading>
          <p>In June 2013 popular anger in Bosnia and Herzegovina at the dysfunctional state erupted into public protests. From 3 June citizens gathered at the parliament of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Sarajevo to protest against its failure to reach an agreement on a draft law on personal identification numbers. This failure had prompted the Constitutional Court to order a halt to the issuing of personal identification numbers to newborn babies, which in turn prevented families from taking their newborns abroad for urgent medical treatment. By 11 June the protesters in Sarajevo numbered about 10,000 and the protests had spread to other cities, including Mostar, Banja Luka and Zenica. Popular anger heightened following the death two days later of a baby in Belgrade, after her transportation there for treatment had been delayed, and over the case of another baby, whose transportation to Tübingen, Germany, was likewise delayed (she died four months after reaching Germany). The law on personal identification numbers was eventually adopted on 18 July, and the protests gradually subsided.</p>
          <p>The 2013 protests were nevertheless merely a foretaste of the popular anger that was to erupt the following year. Demonstrations broke out in Tuzla on 4 February 2014 and rapidly spread throughout the Federation and, to a much lesser extent, throughout Republika Srpska. These protests manifested the greatest violence the country had seen since the end of the war in 1995. On 7 February the cantonal government building in Tuzla was stormed by protesters and the building of the state Presidency in Sarajevo was heavily damaged, and parts of the State Archive of Bosnia and Herzegovina destroyed. The protests triggered the resignation of several heads of cantonal governments, though not of the Government of the Federation, despite calls for its resignation. The rioting subsided within a few days, but peaceful protests continued, manifested in part through the so-called citizens’ plenums, which aimed to provide a conduit through which ordinary people might express their demands for change. Dissatisfaction related above all to the corruption, self-enrichment and economic mismanagement of the political elites, particularly regarding the failed privatization of state-owned companies that had caused financial difficulties for many Bosnians, especially in industrial centres like Tuzla. The protests gradually subsided over a period of weeks, without any significant progress having been made in the fields of economic and political reform. The protests testified to the extent of popular dissatisfaction, but also to the resilience of the order established by the Dayton accords.</p>
          <p>Several years later, popular protests erupted in Banja Luka following the death of a 21-year-old student, David Dragičević, in March 2018. His relatives suspected police involvement, and their protests precipitated what became a large-scale movement against police corruption that demanded the resignation of the Republika Srpska Minister of Internal Affairs, Dragan Lukač. These protests inspired similar protests in mid-May in the cities of Sarajevo and Zenica in the Federation, demanding justice for Dragičević and for Dženan Memić, a young man from Sarajevo, whose death in 2016 was likewise suspected by his parents of being murder, but had been ruled as accidental by the police. On 11 May 2018 the Republika Srpska People’s Assembly voted to establish an Inquiry Board to investigate Dragičević’s death, but its conclusion on 5 June that he had probably been murdered was rejected by the SNSD-led majority in the Assembly and ignored by the Prosecutor’s Office. In December police dispersed protests and arrested several people, including two PDP deputies of the People’s Assembly, provoking condemnation from the EU. In May 2019 it was reported that Dragičević’s father, Davor, was seeking asylum in Austria, three weeks after another prominent critic of Dodik, Slaviša Krunić, was assassinated outside Banja Luka. These protests highlighted that, while strong opposition to Dodik existed in Republika Srpska, it remains firmly entrenched in power and authoritarian in its response to challenges.</p>
          <p>
      Demonstrations have been held in Sarajevo on several occasions since July 2022 to protest against High Representative Christian Schmidt, in relation to changes he planned to make or made to the electoral law and Constitution of the Federation (see 
      <i>Schmidt Imposes Controversial Electoral Changes</i>
      ). However, those demonstrating have numbered no more than several hundred, reflecting limited popular interest.

          <heading>Dodik’s Drive for the Secession of Republika Srpska</heading>
          <p>Since 2006, a new assertiveness and obstructiveness on the part of Republika Srpska has increasingly stymied the OHR’s efforts at reform and reversed much of the previous progress towards reintegration. This has taken place under the leadership of Dodik, who was designated Prime Minister of the entity in February 2006 and remained in that office until November 2010, when he became President of Republika Srpska (and who has resumed that post after serving as the Serb member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2018-22). In July 2006 Dodik led Republika Srpska politicians in a public denunciation of a resolution approved by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, which demanded an end to voting on the basis of the entities as a prelude to the drafting of a new Bosnian constitution. Although the Government of Republika Srpska officially apologized for the Srebrenica massacre in November 2004, and although the 10th anniversary commemoration of the massacre, held at Potočari in Republika Srpska on 11 July 2005, was attended by the President of Republika Srpska in a private capacity, alongside the President of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro (as Yugoslavia had been reconstituted), no official representatives of Republika Srpska attended subsequent commemorations, and Dodik began publicly to question the accepted facts of the massacre. Dodik cited Montenegro’s secession from the State Union in 2006 as setting a precedent for Republika Srpska’s own possible secession from Bosnia and Herzegovina. Following the recognition of the independence of Kosovo from Serbia by the USA and leading EU member states after 17 February 2008, Dodik attended a nationalist protest rally in Belgrade, the Serbian capital, convened by Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Koštunica and others, at which the US embassy was set ablaze. Dodik proposed the eventual secession of Republika Srpska from Bosnia and Herzegovina as a response both to Kosovo’s independence and to demands made by some Bosniak politicians, including former Prime Minister and member of the rotating Presidency Haris Silajdžić, for the abolition of Republika Srpska.</p>
          <p>An act that symbolized the growing confidence of the leadership of Republika Srpska was the signature of an agreement on special relations with Serbia in September 2006. In February 2007 the ruling of the International Court of Justice (ICJ—based in The Hague) on the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina against Serbia, acquitting Serbia of all genocide-related charges except for the failure to prevent and punish genocide, but ruling that Bosnian Serb forces were guilty of genocide at Srebrenica, was widely viewed as a compromise formulation that satisfied neither side. The verdict was received with bitterness by the Bosniak politicians and population, and was rejected by Dodik, who refused to accept that genocide had taken place at Srebrenica. In February 2017 the Bosniak member of the Presidency, Bakir Izetbegović, announced that Bosnia and Herzegovina would lodge an appeal against the verdict, which was consequently submitted to the ICJ by Sakib Softić, Bosnia and Herzegovina’s legal counsel. However, the request was opposed by Mladen Ivanić, the Serb member of the Presidency, and after taking the views of all three members of the Presidency into consideration, the ICJ rejected the request on 9 March, on the grounds that it had not been submitted by the competent authorities.</p>
          <p>The intransigence of the Government of Republika Srpska increased after Bosnia and Herzegovina’s State Investigation and Protection Agency, in February 2009, charged Dodik with abuse of power and embezzlement, and accused several other entity officials of being complicit in a `criminal organization’ led by Dodik. The latter responded by denouncing the charges as a politically motivated attack on the integrity of Republika Srpska, and by openly envisaging secession. He suggested in February that Bosnia and Herzegovina’s two entities could divide easily and peaceably in the manner that Czechoslovakia had divided into the Czech Republic (Czechia) and Slovakia. In February 2010, in response to the OHR’s decision to extend the mandates of the international judges and prosecutors of the War Crimes Chamber of the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the parliament of Republika Srpska adopted legislation permitting the entity to conduct referendums, which Dodik claimed would allow a referendum on whether its citizens supported the Dayton settlement; critics in the international community protested that the new legislation would facilitate the organization of a referendum on independence. So outspoken had Dodik become in favour of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s dissolution that in January 2010 Croatian President Stjepan Mesić threatened to intervene militarily against Republika Srpska if it attempted to secede.</p>
          <p>Apart from periodic statements in favour of secession, Dodik made other provocative moves. These include: in September 2009, presiding at a ceremony in the former wartime Republika Srpska capital of Pale (by then formally part of the city of East Sarajevo), at which Serbian President Boris Tadić was present but to which officials of the Bosnian central state were not invited, when a new school named `Serbia’ was opened; later in the same month claiming that the massacre of Bosniak civilians by the Serb shelling of Tuzla in May 1995 had been carried out by the Bosniaks themselves; extending a warm welcome to convicted Bosnian Serb war criminal (and former President of Republika Srpska) Biljana Plavšić in October 2009, following her early release from prison in Sweden; and, in April 2010, demanding that the Centre for War Crimes Investigation in Banja Luka revise downwards the official death toll of the Srebrenica massacre. Dodik has also emerged as an impediment to the development of military co-operation between Bosnians; in May 2009 he urged Serb soldiers not to take part in a NATO exercise in Georgia in which the army of Bosnia and Herzegovina had been due to participate, and he repeatedly appealed to Russia to guarantee Republika Srpska’s rights according to the Dayton accords. In March 2012 he threatened to organize a referendum in Republika Srpska on the question of NATO membership for Bosnia and Herzegovina (which he opposed).</p>
          <p>In September 2010 the Republika Srpska People’s Assembly took a further step towards extending the de facto sovereignty of the entity, when it passed a law that unilaterally declared all state property on the territory of Republika Srpska to belong to the entity. In April 2011 the People’s Assembly voted to hold a referendum on whether the Court and Prosecutor’s Office of Bosnia and Herzegovina, established by the High Representative, was legitimate. Dodik agreed to postpone the referendum following his meeting with Ashton in Banja Luka on 13 May, but the discussions were widely viewed as a triumph for his policy, since the High Representative had been sidelined and Ashton had conceded that the EU would negotiate with Republika Srpska on addressing its grievances with the Bosnian court system.</p>
          <p>On 9 May 2011 Inzko reported to the UN Security Council that Bosnia and Herzegovina was confronting its worst crisis since the end of the war in 1995, primarily owing to the actions of the Republika Srpska authorities, which were directly threatening the existence of the country. In a media interview in October 2011, Dodik claimed that Bosnia and Herzegovina had been created by the international community against the wishes of its people, that 88% of Republika Srpska’s citizens were in favour of secession from Bosnia and Herzegovina, and that Bosniaks were attempting to dominate the country. On 1 February 2012 the two principal Serb parties, the SNSD and the Srpska Demokratska Stranka (SDS—Serbian Democratic Party), presented a motion in the parliament of Bosnia and Herzegovina demanding the abolition of the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the state prosecutor’s office. This demand was then pursued through the agreement with the SDP BiH that was reached in October.</p>
          <p>Dodik continued to escalate tensions through his statements and actions; on 9 April 2013 he testified at the ICTY in defence of the former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadžić. Following Karadžić’s conviction for genocide and on other charges in March 2016, Dodik expressed admiration for him. Dodik was further encouraged by the challenge to international borders and Western authority represented by the annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula by Russia in March 2014. On 1 April he demanded that Bosnia and Herzegovina become a confederation of three states, again threatening a referendum on the secession of Republika Srpska should his proposal be rejected. The election victory of Mladen Ivanić, heading an opposition bloc (comprising the SDS and the Partija Demokratskog Progresa—PDP—Party of Democratic Progress), against SNSD candidate Željka Cvijanović in the elections of 12 October for the post of Serb member of the state Presidency, and the reduced share of votes for the SNSD in the elections for the state and Republika Srpska legislatures, marked reverses for Dodik, who was narrowly re-elected President of Republika Srpska at the same time. On 25 April 2015, after being re-elected to the post of President of the SNSD, Dodik pledged to hold a referendum on Republika Srpska’s independence in 2018 unless constitutional competencies were returned to it by 2017.</p>
          <p>A major confrontation began on 15 July 2015, when Dodik proposed that a referendum be held in Republika Srpska on the legitimacy of the authority of the OHR and the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina; 45 of the 83 members of the Republika Srpska People’s Assembly voted in favour of the proposal, with no votes against. The legitimacy of this decision was upheld by the Constitutional Court of Republika Srpska on 9 September. On 26 November the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina declared the Republika Srpska’s annual Day of Republika Srpska or Republic Day holiday of 9 January to be illegal—a decision that Bosnian Serb political leaders immediately rejected, threatening to boycott state-level institutions in response. On 10 December the Republika Srpska Government announced that it would suspend co-operation with the state court, Prosecutor’s Office and police, in response to the arrest by the state police of five Serb war crimes suspects. However, on 8 February 2016, under heavy international pressure, Dodik announced that the referendum would be postponed indefinitely. Nevertheless, on 25 September a referendum was held in defiance of a ban by the Constitutional Court, in which the population of Republika Srpska voted to retain 9 January as the Republic Day holiday. At the beginning of January 2017 the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control imposed sanctions on Dodik in response to his defiance of the Constitutional Court order, and he was also denied a US diplomatic visa to attend the inauguration of US President Donald Trump later that month. Critics have suggested that Dodik’s repeated threats over referendums have been simply a means to raise public support and divert attention from the corruption of his regime. Indeed, in April 2016 the Chief Prosecutor of Bosnia and Herzegovina announced that Dodik was under investigation in relation to difficulties at the entity’s Pavlović International Bank, after its director, Slobodan Pavlović, and three other bank officials were arrested on suspicion of laundering money, abuse of power and the forgery of official documents. This occurred after the SDS had accused Pavlović of illegally transferring €750,000 to Dodik during his tenure as Prime Minister.</p>
          <p>Dodik has also sought to increase his leverage with the international community by developing close links with the regime of Russian President Vladimir Putin. In January 2018 it was reported that Russian state-funded mercenaries were training a Bosnian Serb paramilitary unit, Srbska Čast (Serb Honour), under Dodik’s control. This alleged collaboration between Putin and Dodik was direct, rather than mediated by Serbia; indeed, Dodik received an invitation to Putin’s presidential inauguration in the Russian capital, Moscow, in May, while Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić did not. In April 2019, by which time Dodik had become the Serb member of the collective Presidency, it was reported that the Republika Srpska Government was planning to form a reserve police force numbering 1,100, amounting to a nearly 20% increase in the size of the entity’s police. Moreover, the entity police force has become increasingly well armed: some 2,500 automatic rifles were imported for its use from Serbia in March 2018, leading Inzko to comment that the entity was better armed than nearby Slovenia. Another measure taken by the entity Government in the direction of full statehood was the establishment by its police of random checkpoints along the inter-ethnic boundary line in early 2019. Parallel to this, the SDA establishment developed close links with President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey; Izetbegović hosted an election rally for Erdoğan in Sarajevo on 20 May 2018, at which spectators waved Turkish and Bosnian flags together, although the rally was widely condemned by Serb and Croat politicians. Differences over foreign alignment extend to the economic sphere; Bosnian Serb officials criticized Erdoğan’s offer in May of a €3,000m. loan to finance the construction of a highway between Sarajevo and Belgrade.</p>
          <p>There were some indications that elements in government circles within the EU were becoming more receptive to aspects of Dodik’s politics. Stefan Kaufmann, a Christian Democrat member of the German Bundestag (Federal Assembly), congratulated Republika Srpska via social media on its unconstitutional Republic Day holiday on 9 January 2021, although he apologized following outrage in Bosnia and Herzegovina. On 12 April Komšić disclosed that Slovenia’s President, Borut Pahor, had asked the three members of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina whether a peaceful dissolution of the country was possible; on the same day it was revealed publicly that Janez Janša, the Prime Minister of Slovenia, had sent an informal policy paper to EU officials proposing the redrawing of national borders in the Western Balkans, including the annexation of most of Republika Srpska to Serbia, and of Croat-majority areas in the Federation to Croatia, with a Bosniak-majority Bosnia and Herzegovina, comprising about 40% of the state’s original territory, remaining. Albania’s Prime Minister, Edi Rama, subsequently confirmed that Janša had also shown him the proposals. Both Janša and Pahor responded to the revelations by formally denying that they supported the dissolution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but their denials were widely discounted by media in the region.</p>
          <p>Inzko issued a ban on the denial of genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes on 23 July 2021, shortly before his official retirement from the post of High Representative at the end of that month, and replacement by Christian Schmidt, a former German legislator and minister. This was denounced as a provocation by Dodik, whose secessionist policy consequently intensified. On 8 October Dodik announced numerous pieces of legislation to bring about Republika Srpska’s withdrawal from the Bosnian state and to form parallel institutions. This would involve withdrawal from Bosnia and Herzegovina’s intelligence services, defence forces, judiciary, tax authority and customs services. Russia supported Dodik’s move by threatening, at a meeting of the UN Security Council on 3 November, to block the annual renewal of the EUFOR mission to Bosnia and Herzegovina, although Russia ultimately permitted its mandate to be extended by another year. Some observers considered this crisis to amount to Bosnia and Herzegovina’s worst since 1995. The USA responded to Dodik’s move by announcing sanctions against him on 5 January 2022, while the UK on 11 April announced sanctions against both Dodik and Cvijanović, the President of Republika Srpska. The USA also imposed sanctions against a former state Chief Prosecutor, Gordana Tadić of Republika Srpska (who had been dismissed for corrupt practices), in April, and against Alen Šeranić, Republika Srpska’s Minister of Health and Social Welfare, in June. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine beginning on 24 February, had it been immediately successful, might have provided the occasion for Dodik to follow through on his announced secession. However, Russia’s military setbacks, including its defeat in the battle for control of the capital, Kyiv, by the end of March, caused Dodik to postpone his withdrawal of Republika Srpska from Bosnia and Herzegovina’s institutions. Dodik announced the postponement to the entity’s People’s Assembly on 6 June, citing the war in Ukraine. Meanwhile, Republika Srpska sought to obstruct the imposition of sanctions by Bosnia and Herzegovina against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine; while the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Josep Borrell Fontelles, announced on 1 March that Bosnia and Herzegovina had aligned itself with EU sanctions against Russia, the Republika Srpska People’s Assembly confirmed on 6 June that it would not join the sanctions.</p>

          <heading>Bosnia and Herzegovina’s Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic</heading>
          <p>Bosnia and Herzegovina initially appeared to have been comparatively lightly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, the country was subject to some of the harshest lockdown rules in Europe. Foreign citizens were banned from entering the country on 24 March 2020, and international passenger flights were halted on 30 March.</p>
          <p>Republika Srpska was the first of the two entities to react to the outbreak. On 10 March 2020 it banned public gatherings, closed schools and halted the entry of all foreigners from countries affected by COVID-19. Most cities and towns ordered the closure of restaurants, cafés, gyms, fitness centres and non-essential retail outlets by the middle of the month. A nightly curfew was introduced on weekdays between 21 March and 22 May, with a complete ban on the public movement of people aged over 65 years. A state of emergency for the entire entity came into force on 3 April, which included an additional weekend curfew (lifted on 9 May).</p>
          <p>In the Federation, schools and universities were closed on 11 March 2020, while all public gatherings were banned and restaurants, cafés, gyms, swimming pools and non-essential retail outlets closed on 18 March. On 20 March those aged under 18 and over 65 were banned from leaving their homes (although the restrictions were subsequently amended to permit their transport in private vehicles). On 21 March the Federation imposed a night-time curfew for all residents. Mandatory social distancing measures were subsequently introduced. The ban on the public movement of children and the elderly was the focus of a successful legal challenge at the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which ruled on 22 April that the ban was discriminatory, and ordered its repeal. Consequently, the decree was amended on 24 April. The curfew on people aged 18-65 years was lifted on the same day. The restrictions on movement for people aged under 18 or over 65 were ended in May. However, some restrictions were reintroduced in November 2020, and in March 2021 restrictions were tightened once more, with a curfew in the Federation, public gatherings limited, obligatory social distancing of two metres and the compulsory wearing of masks in public. The Republika Srpska authorities closed ski resorts, swimming pools, spas, theatres and cinemas, while all other businesses except pharmacies were required to close between 10&#160;p.m. and 6&#160;a.m. In the Federation, the regulations varied according to canton, but many closed bars, restaurants, gyms and sports facilities. On 20 May the curfew in the Federation was lifted, and the gradual easing of the measures imposed in both entities continued during mid-2021.</p>
          <p>Although GDP recorded a negative rate of growth in 2020, positive growth resumed in 2021. There were suggestions that public officials might have improperly sought to profit from the COVID-19 crisis. In May Federation Prime Minister Fadil Novalić, the head of the Civil Protection Directorate, Fahrudin Solak, and a businessman, Fikret Hodžić, were questioned by police (and convicted in April 2023) over the purchase of 100 overpriced ventilators from the People’s Republic of China.</p>
          <p>On 12 November 2020 it was reported that Bosnia and Herzegovina had ordered over 1m. doses of COVID-19 vaccine. However, by 17 April 2021 the country had administered only 15,000 doses, or 0.5 per 100 people—the lowest rate of any country in Europe. At that time, the number of deaths from COVID-19 recorded in Bosnia and Herzegovina (per million of the population) was the third highest in the world, after the Czech Republic and Hungary. In these circumstances, it was reported on 2 March that Serbia’s President Vučić had donated 10,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine to the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, while tens of thousands of Bosnian citizens subsequently travelled to Serbia to receive vaccination. This failure to provide citizens with vaccines, and the consequent reliance on the historical enemy for them, produced considerable comment in the Bosnian media. By 29 January 2022, according to the World Health Organization, a total of 1.9m. vaccine doses had been administered in Bosnia and Herzegovina, amounting to the vaccination of an estimated 29.2% of the population. In late May all COVID-19 international entry restrictions were abolished and by that time the remaining domestic measures for containing the spread of the COVID-19 virus in Bosnia and Herzegovina had largely been ended. </p>

          <heading>Schmidt Imposes Controversial Electoral Changes</heading>
          <p>
      High Representative Schmidt attracted controversy from 2022, with critics claiming that changes introduced by him effectively gave increased power to Croat and Serb nationalists to the detriment of Bosnian politicians pushing for greater integration. In July 2022 Schmidt proposed plans to remove the right of members of the constituent peoples in the cantons to have representatives in the Federation House of Peoples if their share of the canton’s population was less than 3%; the move would have effectively strengthened the representation in that chamber of the HDZ BiH, whose voters were concentrated in the Croat-majority areas in the south of the Federation. This followed a longstanding inter-party dispute and a 2017 ruling by the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina on a case brought by a prominent member of 
      
      the HDZ BiH that certain provisions of the election law regarding the Federation House of Peoples were not in conformity with the Constitution. After meeting public opposition, however, the proposal was abandoned.
    </p>
          <p>A general election took place on 2 October 2022, after which the SDA, the SNSD, the SDP BiH and the HDZ BiH remained the leading parties in the state House of Representatives, with nine, six, five and four seats, respectively. Denis Bećirović of the SDP BiH was elected as the Bosniak member of the state Presidency, while Komšić secured re-election as the Croat member and Cvijanović succeeded Dodik as the Serb member. In the Federation House of Representatives, the most seats were won by the SDA (with 26), the SDP BiH (15), the HDZ BiH (15), a coalition of the DF and Građanski Savez (Civic Alliance—12), the NiP (seven) and NS (six). In Republika Srpska, the presidential election was won by Dodik, with 47.1% of the votes cast, while the SNSD remained the dominant party in the People’s Assembly, securing 29 seats, followed by the SDS, with 13 seats, and the PDP, with eight.</p>
          <p>Immediately after the polls had closed, Schmidt used the `Bonn Powers’ to impose amendments to the election law and the Constitution of the Federation which increased the number of delegates in the Federation House of Peoples from 17 to 23 per constituent people, with the number of delegates representing minority groups increased from seven to 11, and ruled that 17 of the 32 Croat delegates would come from the cantons under complete HDZ BiH control. Schmidt also raised the threshold required to nominate a candidate for Federation President from six of 17 members of the caucus of a constituent people (35.3%) to 11 of 23 members (47.8%). Critics argued that the effect of these changes, which had been undertaken with the stated aim of improving the functionality of the Federation’s institutions, was to allow the HDZ BiH a leading role in nominating the Croat candidate for Federation President or Vice-President, consequently ensuring that a Federation government could not be appointed contrary to the party’s wishes. Komšić and former Bosniak member of the Presidency Šefik Džaferović appealed against the changes at the Constitutional Court, which on 2 December ruled in favour of the High Representative.</p>
          <p>Following the elections, a coalition was reached in November 2022 between the SNSD, the HDZ BiH, the SDP BiH, the DNS, NS, NiP and the BH Zeleni (BH Greens), which formed a state-level Council of Ministers, chaired by Borjana Krišto of the HDZ BiH, on 25 January 2023. The coalition effectively excluded the SDA and the DF from power. However, a prolonged deadlock in the formation of the Federation government followed the election, owing to the refusal of Federation Vice-President, Refik Lendo of the SDA, to accept a government that did not include representatives of his party. Consequently, Schmidt again employed the `Bonn Powers’ on 27 April to impose changes to the Constitution of the Federation, whereby, in the event that the government was supported by the President but only one of the Vice-Presidents, it could still be referred for approval by the Federation House of Representatives. If the House of Representatives failed to approve the new government, the Federation Parliament and the 10 cantonal assemblies would be dissolved and new elections held for them. On the following day a coalition Government principally comprising the SDP BiH, the HDZ BiH, HDZ 1990, NS and the NiP was approved in the Federation, under the premiership of Nermin Nikšić.</p>

          <heading>28 Years after Dayton: An Assessment</heading>
          <p>Some 28 years after the signature of the Dayton accords, Bosnia and Herzegovina’s prospects as a state appeared bleaker than had been the case several years previously. The fundamentally contradictory and disintegrative aspects of the Dayton constitutional system were, initially, partially overridden by a powerful OHR that was willing and able, in the interests of a better-functioning Bosnia and Herzegovina, to implement reforms that modified this system. However, the OHR became the victim of its own success, leading to complacency on the part of the international community. The consequent international efforts to terminate the mandate of the OHR and the increasing international unwillingness to support it in its confrontations with local opponents made possible a revived Bosnian Serb intransigence under the leadership of Dodik, as a result of which much of the apparent progress towards reintegration unravelled. The failure of post-war reconciliation was symbolized at the 20th anniversary commemoration of the Srebrenica massacre at Potočari on 11 July 2015, when some of those attending threw missiles at Vučić, then the Serbian Prime Minister, three days after Russia, at Serbia’s request, had vetoed a British-drafted UN resolution in favour of recognizing the massacre as genocide. Dodik’s ongoing influence in Republika Srpska continued to undermine the process of reintegration and reconciliation, and call into question Bosnia and Herzegovina’s very existence as a state, while the international community remained halfhearted in its resistance to this challenge. In addition, High Representative Schmidt’s use of the `Bonn Powers’ in 2022, while failing to prevent a lengthy delay in the post-election formation of the Federation Government and necessitating a further intervention, was perceived by many to accommodate Croat nationalist demands and suggested to critics that the OHR has ceased to be a force promoting the country’s integration. In these circumstances, Bosnia and Herzegovina appears set for more turbulence in the years ahead.</p>
