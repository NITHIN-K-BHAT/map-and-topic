               <p id="BA.IS.3">Bosnia and Herzegovina is situated in South-Eastern Europe. It is bounded by Croatia to the north, west and south-west, by Serbia to the east and by Montenegro to the south-east. There is a short south-western coastline on the Adriatic Sea, and an exclave of Croatia, around Dubrovnik, lies to the south-east. Bosnia and Herzegovina is a largely mountainous territory with a continental climate and steady rainfall throughout the year; nearer the coast the climate is more Mediterranean. The official languages are Bosnian, Cro­atian and Serbian. Bosnian and Cro­atian are written in the Latin script, while Serbian has traditionally been written in the Cyrillic script, but is also written in the Latin script. Muslims (Bosniaks), the majority of whom belong to the Sunni sect, are the largest religious grouping, comprising 50.7% of the population (according to the 2013 census). Religious affiliation is roughly equated with ethnicity, the Serbs (30.8% of the population) belonging to the Serbian Orthodox Church and the Croats (15.4%) mostly being members of the Roman Catholic Church. The national flag (proportions 1 by 2) consists of two unequal vertical sections of blue, separated by a yellow triangle, which is bordered on the left by a diagonal line of nine white, five-pointed stars. The capital is Sarajevo.</p>

                    <heading>Historical Context</heading>
                    <p id="BA.IS.5">The provinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina formed part of the Turkish OsmanlI (Ottoman) Empire for almost 400 years, but, following the Congress of Berlin of 1878, were administered by the Habsburg Empire of Austria-Hungary, which formally annexed the territories in 1908. The population of the provinces was composed of Orthodox Christian Serbs, Roman Catholic Croats and Muslims (Bosniaks). Serbian expansionist aims caused tension from the late 19th century, and in 1914, following the assassination of the heir to the Habsburg throne by a Bosnian Serb extremist in Sarajevo, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, precipitating the First World War. On 4 December 1918 the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was proclaimed, under the Serbian monarchy. Amid bitter disputes between Serbs and Croats, in 1929 King Aleksandar imposed a dictatorship, formally renaming the country Yugoslavia in October.</p>
                    <p id="BA.IS.6">Although proscribed in 1921, the Communist Party of Yugoslavia operated clandestinely, and in 1937 Josip Broz (Tito) became its General Secretary. During the Second World War (1939-45) intense fighting took place in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which was incorporated into a fascist Independent State of Croatia in 1941. After the war, Bosnia and Herzegovina became one of the six constituent republics of the Yugo­slav federation. In the 1960s Tito sought to maintain a balance of power between the ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY—as the country was renamed in 1963) as a whole. Slav Muslims were granted a recognized official ethnic status, as a nation of Yugoslavia, prior to the 1971 census. In that year a rotating collective state Presi­dency was established for Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>

                    <heading>Domestic Political Affairs</heading>
                    <p id="BA.IS.7">At elections to the republican legislature, the Skupština Republike Bosne i Hercegovine (Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina Assembly), in late 1990, three ethnically based parties secured the greatest representation: the (principally Bosniak) Stranka Demokratske Akcije (SDA—Party of Democratic Action), won 86 seats; the Srpska Demokratska Stranka (SDS—Serbian Democratic Party) 72 seats; and the Hrvatska Demokratska Zajednica Bosne i Hercegovine (HDZ BiH—Croatian Democratic Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina) 44. These parties also took all the seats on the directly elected seven-member collective Presidency. On 20 December SDA leader Alija Izetbegović was named President of the Presidency.</p>
                    <p id="BA.IS.8">Following the declarations of independence by Slovenia and Croatia in June 1991, and the ensuing conflict, particularly in Croatia, Serb-dominated territories in Bosnia and Herzegovina declared their intent to remain within the Yugoslav federation. On 16 September a `Serb Autonomous Region’ (SAR) of Bosnian Krajina, based in the north-western city of Banja Luka, was proclaimed; this SAR was formed on the basis of a Serb Community of Municipalities of Bosnian Krajina’, established in April, which had announced its unification with the neighbouring SAR of Krajina’ in Croatia in June. The formation of further SARs was proclaimed, amid accusations that Serb nationalist elements sought to establish a Greater Serbia’, with the support of the Yugoslav People’s Army (JNA).</p>
                    <p id="BA.IS.9">In October 1991 the republican Presidency (with the dissenting votes of the Bosnian Serb members) and the SDA proposed that the republic declare independence. Serb deputies rejected an Assembly resolution to that end, and withdrew from the chamber. On 15 October the remaining parliamentarians approved a resolution declaring the sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In response, the SARs declared that, henceforth, only the federal laws and Constitution would apply on their territory. On 24 October the Serb deputies of the republican legislature announced the creation of a Narodna Skupština (People’s Assembly), which organized a referendum held on 9-10 November that indicated strong support among Bosnian Serbs for remaining in a common state with Serbs elsewhere in Yugoslavia. On 9 January 1992 the formation of a Serb Republic (Republika Srpska) of Bosnia and Herzegovina’, comprising Serb-held areas of the republic (about 65% of the total area), was proclaimed, headed by Radovan Karadžić, the leader of the SDS. The republican Government immediately declared this secessionist republic, based in Banja Luka, to be illegal; in August it was renamed `Republika Srpska’. Meanwhile, in a republic-wide referendum on 29 February-1 March, boycotted by the majority of Bosnian Serbs, 99.4% of the participating 63% of the electorate supported independence for Bosnia and Herzegovina, which was duly declared by Izetbegović.</p>

                         <p id="BA.IS.111391891113">
            Serb-Bosniak tensions led to clashes in Sarajevo and elsewhere. On 18 March 1992, following mediation by the European Community (EC, now 
            <xr pageref="Y" ref="WB02047.IO.TXT">European Union—EU</xr>
            ), the leaders of the Serb, Croat and Bosniak communities signed an agreement providing for the division of Bosnia and Herzegovina into three autonomous units. In April fighting between the JNA and Bosniak and Croat forces intensified, particularly after the EC and the USA recognized Bosnia and Herzegovina’s independence on 7 April; Serb troops besieged Sarajevo, launching mortar attacks on the city, while Serb fighters began a campaign of `ethnic cleansing’ in the east and north-west of Bosnia. Izetbegović requested foreign military intervention, but the United Nations (UN), while deploying a Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Croatia, decided not to deploy a peacekeeping force in Bosnia and Herzegovina. On 20 May the Government declared the JNA to be an occupying force’ and announced the formation of a repub­lican army. Two days later, Bosnia and Herzegovina was admitted to the UN. On 30 May the UN imposed economic sanctions against the recently established Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (comprising Serbia and Monte­negro), in response to its involvement in the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
          </p>
                         <p id="BA.IS.121391891113">The proclamation, on 3 July 1992, by Croats in western and central Bosnia and Herzegovina, of an autonomous `Croat Community of Herceg-Bosna’, covering about 30% of the territory of the country and headed by Mate Boban, was immediately declared to be illegal by Izetbegović. Hos­tilities erupted between Croats and Bosniaks in October, and Croat forces captured the towns of Mostar, Novi Travnik and Vitez. Mostar was proclaimed the capital of Herceg-Bosna, with the city effectively being split into Croat- and Bosniak-controlled zones, the Serb population of the city having largely fled. In November the Croatian Government admitted that Croatian army units had been deployed in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and became a signatory to the latest ceasefire agreement in the republic. In December the UN Security Council unani­mously adopted a resolution condemning atrocities and demanding access to Serb detention camps.</p>
                         <p id="BA.IS.15">In January 1993 the Co-Chairmen of the Geneva Peace Conference (a forum for talks on the conflict), Lord (David) Owen (a former British Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs) and Cyrus Vance (the UN mediator and a former US Secretary of State), began to seek support for a peace plan, to divide Bosnia and Herzegovina into 10 provinces. On 22 February the UN Security Council adopted a resolution providing for the establishment of an international court to try alleged war criminals for acts committed in the former territories of the SFRY. On 31 March the UN Security Council adopted a resolution permitting `all necessary measures’ to enforce a no fly zone’ imposed over Bosnia and Herzegovina in October 1992. Following pressure from Serbian President Slobodan Milošević, Karadžić signed the Vance-Owen plan in Geneva, Switzerland, on 30 April 1993, but it was rejected by the Bosnian Serb legislature a few days later.</p>
                         <p id="BA.IS.17">In May 1993 the USA, France, the Russian Federation, Spain and the United Kingdom signed a communiqué declaring that the arms embargo on the post-SFRY states would continue and that international armed forces would not intervene, proposing instead the creation of six safe areas’ at Sarajevo, Bihać, Tuzla, Goražde, Srebrenica and Žepa, in which disarmed Bosniaks would be settled. In June a UN Security Council resolution permitted UNPROFOR to use force, including air power, in response to attacks against these safe areas’.</p>
                         <p id="BA.IS.18">On 30 July 1993, following new peace proposals by Owen and new UN mediator Thorvald Stoltenberg, a constitutional agreement was reached on the reconstruction of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a confederation of three ethnically determined states, under a central government with limited powers. However, fighting continued. On 28 August the self-proclaimed Croat Republic of Herceg-Bosna’ proceeded to accept the Owen-Stoltenberg plan, on condition that the Serbs and Bosniaks also accepted it. The Bosnian Serb Assembly also voted in favour, but the plan was rejected by the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina Assembly three days later. On 10 September Fikret Abdić, the Bosniak member of the state Presidency, announced the creation of an Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia’ in the north-western region around Bihać, of which he subsequently became `President’. Izetbegović imposed martial law on the area, and government forces attacked troops under Abdić’s command. Abdić was dismissed from the state Presidency in October.</p>
                         <p id="BA.IS.22">
            In February 1994 the shelling of a Sarajevo market, killing at least 68 people, prompted the UN to threaten military intervention against Serb forces. Following an ultimatum by the 
            <xr pageref="Y" ref="NATO.IO">North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)</xr>
            , the Bosnian Serbs withdrew most of their heavy weaponry from a 20-km `exclusion zone’ around the city, which, however, remained blockaded. In late February NATO forces near Banja Luka shot down four Serb aircraft, which had violated the UN prohibition of non-humanitarian flights over the country. Following a ceasefire agreed by the republican Government and Herceg-Bosna, Haris Silajdžić (Prime Minister of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina since October 1993) and Kresimir Zubak (who had replaced Boban as the leader of Herceg-Bosna) signed an agreement on 18 March 1994, in Washington, DC, USA, for the creation of a Federation on those territories in Bosnia and Herzegovina controlled by Croats and Bosniaks. A further agreement was signed by Izetbegović and President Franjo Tuđman of Croatia, providing for the eventual creation of a loose confederation of the Federation and Croatia. In late March the accords were approved by the Herceg-Bosna assembly, and the new Constitution was ratified by the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina Assembly. In April, in response to the continued shelling of the safe area’ of Goražde by Bosnian Serb forces, UN-sanctioned air strikes were launched by NATO aircraft on Serb ground positions. Later that month a new nego­tiating forum, the Contact Group, comprising representatives from France, Germany, Russia, the UK and the USA, was established.
          </p>
                         <p id="BA.IS.25">In May 1994 the new Ustavotvorna Skupština Federacije Bosne i Hercegovine (Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina Constituent Assembly) elected Zubak to the largely ceremonial post of President of the Federation. Ejup Ganić, a Bosniak, was elected Vice-President of the Federation, and Silajdžić was appointed Prime Minister of the Federation. A joint Government of the Federation and the Republic, led by Silajdžić, was appointed in June. By the end of that month government forces had captured formerly Serb-held areas of central Bosnia. The Contact Group presented new peace pro­posals in July, according to which the Federation would be granted 51% of the country’s territory. On 17 July Izetbegović and Tuđman endorsed the plan, as did the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina Assembly, but the Bosnian Serb legislature rejected the ceding of around one-third of the territory controlled by Bosnian Serbs. On 5 August NATO air strikes were launched against Bosnian Serb targets, in response to attacks against UN forces and the renewed shelling of Sarajevo. In late August 96% of participants in a referendum held in the Bosnian Serb-held areas voted to reject the Contact Group plan; the Bosnian Serb Assembly unanimously approved this rejection on 1 September. Meanwhile, on 21 August Bihać had been captured by government forces. On 31 December the Bosnian Serb authorities and the republican Government signed a four-month ceasefire agreement. However, fighting continued in the Bihać enclave between government forces and troops loyal to Abdić, who was supported by troops from the adjoining Republic of Serb Krajina’ in Croatia.</p>
                         <p id="BA.IS.31">On 20 February 1995 representatives of the Bosnian and Croatian Serbs signed a military pact. In early March, in response, a formal military alliance was announced between Croatia, Herceg-Bosna and the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. On 25 May, following a UN request in response to the continued bombardment of Sarajevo, NATO aircraft carried out strikes on Bosnian Serb ammunition depots. Serb forces responded by shelling five of the six safe areas’ and on 26 May undertook a massive bombardment of Tuzla, killing at least 70 people. Bosnian Serb troops subsequently took hostage 222 UNPROFOR personnel in Goražde. In June NATO and European defence ministers agreed to form a 10,000-strong rapid reaction force’, to provide enhanced protection’ to UNPROFOR. Meanwhile, the release of the remaining hostages coincided with the withdrawal of UNPROFOR from Bosnian Serb-controlled territory around Sarajevo.</p>
                         <p id="BA.IS.32">On 11 July 1995 Bosnian Serb fighters captured the safe area’ of Srebrenica; some 8,000 male civilians were subsequently killed by Bosnian Serb forces, the worst atrocity to take place in Europe since the end of the Second World War. Bihać was attacked on 20 July by Bosnian Serbs, Croatian Serbs, and rebel Bosniaks led by Abdić, precipitating the signature of a military co-operation agreement between Izetbegović and Tuđman. Croatian government forces invaded the Croatian Serb-held Krajina on 4 August, and rapidly recaptured the entire enclave. On 6-7 August the siege of Bihać was ended by Bosnian government and Croatian troops. On 28 August a mortar attack on a market in central Sarajevo, attributed to Bosnian Serb forces, resulted in some 38 deaths. Two days later NATO commenced air strikes (Operation Deliberate Force’) on Serb positions throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina, which continued for several weeks.</p>

                         <heading>The Dayton Accords</heading>
                         <p id="BA.IS.351391891113">On 8 September 1995 the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Yugoslavia, meeting in Geneva under the auspices of the Contact Group, signed an agreement determining basic principles for a peace accord, including the existence of Bosnia and Herzegovina within its present borders, but comprising two administrative units, known as entities: the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina; and Republika Srpska. In mid-September Operation Deliberate Force’ was suspended, following the withdrawal of Bosnian Serb weaponry from the exclusion zone’ around Sa­rajevo. Agreement on further basic principles for a peace accord was reached by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Yugoslavia, meeting in New York, USA, on 26 September. A 60-day ceasefire took effect on 12 October.</p>
                         <p id="BA.IS.36">On 1 November 1995 peace negotiations between the three warring parties began in Dayton, Ohio, USA. A comprehensive peace agreement was reached on 21 November, when Izetbegović, Tuđman and Milošević initialled the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, dividing Bosnia and Herzegovina between a Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with 51% of the territory (including the city of Sarajevo), and Republika Srpska, with 49%. Whereas the Government of Republika Srpska was to be highly centralized, with a directly elected presidency and no level of local government other than that of municipality, power in the Federation was devolved to 10 cantonal administrations, as well as to municipalities. A state government (encompassing the whole country) was to have an elected collective Presidency and a parliament. Within the state parliament, Republika Srpska was to be apportioned one-third and the Federation two-thirds of the seats (legislative decisions were to be implemented with the approval of at least one-third of the deputies of each entity), and the Presidency was to be organized according to same proportional division. The agreement stipulated the right of refugees and displaced persons to return to their homes and to have property returned to them or to receive compensation. An international, NATO-commanded, 60,000-strong Implementation Force (IFOR) was to be mandated to oversee the withdrawal of the warring parties from zones of separation and to monitor agreed exchanges of territory. It was estimated that around 200,000 people had been killed in the conflict, which had displaced some 2.7m. people.</p>
                         <p id="BA.IS.37">
            At a conference on the implementation of the Dayton peace accords, held in London, UK, in early December 1995, it was agreed that an 
            <xr pageref="Y" ref="OSCE.IO">Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)</xr>
             mission would organize and monitor parliamentary elections and that the Contact Group would be replaced by a Peace Implementation Council (PIC) based in Brussels, Belgium. The Swedish former Prime Minister and EU envoy to the peace talks, Carl Bildt, was appointed High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, with responsibility for the implementation of the civilian aspects of the accords. On 14 December the Dayton peace agreement was formally signed by Izetbegović, Tuđman and Milošević, and by President Bill Clinton of the USA and a number of European political leaders in Paris, France. Power was transferred from UNPROFOR to IFOR on 20 December.
          </p>
                         <p id="BA.IS.38">On 30 January 1996 Hasan Muratović was elected by the state assembly as Prime Minister of Bosnia and Herzegovina, following Silajdžić’s resignation; a new state Government was appointed, and a new Federation Government one day later. In February a joint Croat-Bosniak security patrol, reinforced by UN officers, was deployed in Mostar. In May Bosniak and Croat leaders, meeting in Washington, DC, agreed on the merger of their armed forces and the return of refugees.</p>
                         <p>Since Karadžić had been indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), based in The Hague, Netherlands, for war crimes, his position as President of Republika Srpska (and that of Gen. Ratko Mladić as head of the armed forces) was in breach of the Dayton agreement; Karadžić delegated some powers to his deputy, Biljana Plavšić. Following an ultimatum by Western European countries, in June 1996 Karadžić announced the appointment of Plavšić as the acting Pres­ident of Republika Srpska. In mid-July the ICTY issued arrest warrants for Karadžić (who resigned from the Presidency and as head of the SDS) and Mladić.</p>

                         <heading>Post-conflict Elections</heading>
                         <p id="BA.IS.43">Elections were held on 14 September 1996 to the state Presidency and Predstavnički Dom/Zastupnički Dom (House of Representatives, the lower chamber of the bicameral Parlamentarna Skupština Bosne i Hercegovine—Bosnia and Herzegovina Parliamentary Assembly). Elections also took place at entity level, to the Republika Srpska Presidency and legislature, to cantonal au­thorities within the Federation and to the Predstavnički Dom Federacije/Zastupnički Dom Federacije (Federation House of Representatives, the lower chamber of a bicameral Parlament Federacije—Federation Parliament). At the election to the state collective Presidency, Izetbegović won 80% of the Bosniak votes cast; Zubak (the candidate of the HDZ BiH) 88% of the Croat votes; and Momčilo Krajišnik (of the SDS) 67% of the Serb votes; Izetbegović became Chairman of the Presidency. The SDA and the HDZ BiH dominated both the Federation section of the House of Representatives and the Federation lower chamber; however, an alliance of social-democratic Bosniak and Croat parties, the Joint List of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the Party for Bosnia and Herzegovina (SBiH—led by Silajdžić) won a significant number of votes in the elections to the state and Federation legislatures. The SDS secured a majority in both the Serb section of the House of Representatives and in the Republika Srpska National Assembly. Plavšić was elected Pres­ident of Republika Srpska, receiving 59% of the votes. Following the OSCE’s endorsement of the election results, on 1 October the UN Security Council decided to remove sanctions against Yugoslavia and Republika Srpska. In November Plavšić announced Mladić’s dismissal.</p>
                         <p id="BA.IS.46">A Stabilization Force (SFOR) succeeded IFOR on 20 December 1996. In mid-December the state Presidency appointed Silajdžić and Boro Bosić of the SDS as Co-Prime Ministers. Later in the month the dissolution of Herceg-Bosna was announced and a Federation Prime Minister elected. The state Council of Ministers was appointed by the Co-Prime Ministers and approved at the inaugural session of the bicameral Parliamentary Assembly (comprising the indirectly elected Dom Naroda—House of Peoples—and the House of Representatives) on 3 January 1997.</p>
                         <p id="BA.IS.47">In June 1997 Bildt was replaced as High Representative by Carlos Westendorp. In July Plavšić announced the dissolution of the Republika Srpska National Assembly, following the Assembly’s opposition to the suspension of the entity’s Minister of Internal Affairs by Plavšić (who was expelled from the SDS). In August the Constitutional Court ruled that Plavšić’s dissolution of the legislature had been illegal; the National Assembly subsequently voted to disregard future decrees issued by her. At municipal elections, held on 13-14 September in both entities, the three main nationalist parties—the SDA, the HDZ BiH and the SDS—received the majority of the votes cast.</p>
                         <p id="BA.IS.48">Elections to the Republika Srpska National Assembly were held on 22-23 November 1997, under the supervision of the OSCE. Although the representation of the SDS was reduced to 24 seats, it remained the largest party in the legislature. A new electoral alliance, the Koalicija za Cjelovitu i Demokratsku Bosnu i Hecegovinu (KCD BiH—Coalition for a Single and Demo­cratic Bosnia and Herzegovina), which included the SDA and the SBiH, secured 16 seats, while the Srpski Narodni Savez (SNS—Serb National Alliance), recently established by Plavšić, and the Srpska Radikalna Stranka (SRS—Serbian Radical Party) each received 15. In January 1998 Milorad Dodik, leader of the Stranka Nezavisnih Socijaldemokrata Republike Srpske (SNSRS—Party of Independent Social Democrats of Republika Srpska), secured sufficient parliamentary support to form a government. At the end of the month Dodik announced the transfer of government bodies from Pale to Banja Luka.</p>
                         <p id="BA.IS.521391891113">At September 1998 elections to the state Presidency and legislature, to the Republika Srpska Presidency and legislature, and to the Federation House of Representatives, Izetbegović was re-elected as the Bosniak member of the collective Presidency; the Chairman of the Socijalistička Partija Respublike Srpske (Socialist Party of Republika Srpska—SPRS), a member of the SNS-led Sloga (Accord) coalition, Živko Radišić, replaced Krajišnik, and HDZ BiH Chairman Ante Jelavić was elected as the Croat member of the Presidency. In Republika Srpska, the Chairman of the SRS, Nikola Poplasen, secured the Presidency, defeating Plavšić. The SDS retained 19 of the 83 seats in the Republika Srpska National Assembly, while the KCD BiH won 15; the latter also secured 14 of the 42 seats in the House of Representatives and 68 of the 140 seats in the Federation lower chamber. In October Sloga, which held 32 seats in the Republika Srpska National Assembly, rejected Poplasen’s nomination of SDS Chairman Dragan Kalinić as Prime Minister of the entity, and supported the reappointment of Dodik to the post. In December the Federation Parliament re-elected Ganić as President (a post he had held since December 1997) and a new Federation Council of Ministers was estab­lished.</p>
                         <p id="BA.IS.551391891113">In March 1999, after Poplasen proposed a motion in favour of Dodik’s dismissal in the Republika Srpska National Assembly, Westendorp announced Poplasen’s removal from office, on the grounds that he had exceeded his authority. (Mirko Šarović, the Vice-President, provisionally assumed the presidential office.) In the same month international arbitrators ruled that Brčko (hitherto under Serb control) would be governed jointly by Republika Srpska and the Federation, under international supervision. (In March 2000 Brčko was established as a neutral district, and an Interim District Government was established.)</p>
                         <p id="BA.IS.571391391113">In August 1999 Wolfgang Petritsch succeeded Westendorp as High Representative. In February 2000 the SPRS withdrew from the Sloga coalition in Republika Srpska, after Dodik dismissed the SPRS Deputy Prime Minister, Tihomir Gligorić. In March a senior Bosnian Croat commander, Gen. Tihomir Blaškić, was sentenced by the ICTY to 45 years’ imprisonment (later reduced to nine years) for war crimes perpetrated against Bosniaks in 1992-93. In April 2000 Krajišnik was arrested by SFOR troops and extradited to the ICTY.</p>
                         <p id="BA.IS.581391891113">At local elections, held on 8 April 2000, the SDS won control of 49 of the 145 municipal councils, the HDZ BiH secured 25 and the SDA 23. In June a new state Council of Ministers, led by a non-party candidate, Spasoje Tuševljak, was appointed. A member of the HDZ BiH, Martin Raguž, replaced Tuševljak as Chairman of the Council of Ministers in October.</p>

                         <heading>Decline in Support for Nationalist Parties</heading>
                         <p id="BA.IS.60">On 11 November 2000 elections were conducted to the House of Representatives, to the legislatures of both entities and to the Presidency of Republika Srpska. In the elections to the 42-member House of Representatives, the multi-ethnic Socijal­demokratska Partija BiH (SDP BiH—Social Democratic Party of Bosnia and Herzegovina) secured nine seats, the SDA eight seats, the SDS six seats and the HDZ BiH five seats, while in the 140-member Federation House of Representatives the SDA won 38 seats, the SDP BiH 37 seats, the HDZ BiH 25 seats and the SBiH 21 seats; the results were considered to reflect a relative decline in support for the nationalist parties. The SDS secured 31 of the 83 seats in the Republika Srpska National Assembly, while the SPRS and the Partija Demokratskog Progresa (PDP—Party of Democratic Progress) each received 11 seats. Šarović, the SDS candidate, was elected to the Presidency of Republika Srpska, with some 49.8% of the votes cast, defeating Dodik. The SDS subsequently established a parliamentary coalition with the PDP, the SPRS and the SDA, thereby securing a majority in the National Assembly. In December Šarović designated Mladen Ivanić, the leader of the PDP, as Prime Minister of Republika Srpska. In the following month Ivanić formed the entity’s first multi-ethnic Council of Ministers.</p>
                         <p id="BA.IS.62">In January 2001 Plavšić surrendered to the ICTY, following her indictment on charges of involvement in the organization of genocide and deportation of Bosniaks and Croats. Meanwhile, the SDP BiH had established parliamentary coalitions in the House of Representatives and the Federation lower chamber. On 22 February the House of Representatives approved a new state Council of Ministers, after endorsing the nomination by the Presidency of SDP BiH candidate Božidar Matić as Chairman. On 28 February the Federation House of Representatives elected Karlo Filipović of the SDP BiH as President of the Federation. Meanwhile, in response to the rejection of Raguž’s candidacy to the state premiership, a newly formed grouping of parties led by the HDZ BiH, the self-styled `Croat People’s Assembly’, declared self-government in three Croat-majority cantons. Petritsch subsequently dismissed Jelavić from the collective Presidency. On 28 March the House of Representatives voted to appoint Jozo Križanović of the SDP BiH as the Croat member of the collective Presidency and Beriz Belkić of the SBiH as the Bosniak member (Izetbegović had retired the previous October). Following negotiations the Croat alliance agreed to end its boycott of state institutions in May.</p>
                         <p id="BA.IS.64">Matić resigned in June 2001, and on 18 July the Parliamentary Assembly approved the nomination of Zlatko Lagumdžija, the leader of the SDP BiH and the erstwhile Minister of Foreign Affairs, as Chairman of the Council of Ministers. In August the ICTY obtained its first conviction on charges of genocide, sentencing a former senior Serb army officer, Radislav Krstić, to 46 years’ imprisonment (reduced to a 35-year term) for his responsibility for the massacre at Srebrenica in 1995. In October 2001 the Republika Srpska National Assembly adopted legislation requiring its security forces actively to pursue and extradite war crimes suspects to the ICTY. In November Milošević—who had been extradited to the ICTY in June and charged with crimes against humanity relating to Croatia in 1991-92 and to Kosovo in 1999—was additionally indicted on the basis of responsibility for genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1992-95. (Milošević died in March 2006, while on trial.)</p>
                         <p id="BA.IS.10391725391">In March 2002 the leading political parties, under pressure from Petritsch, agreed on constitutional reforms, to ensure the representation at all levels of government of Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs. To that end, an indirectly elected Vijeće Naroda (Council of Peoples—comprising eight Bosniaks, eight Croats, eight Serbs and four others) was established within the Republika Srpska National Assembly.</p>
                         <p>In May 2002 Lord (Paddy) Ashdown, a British politician, succeeded Petritsch as High Representative, and was additionally appointed to the new position of EU Special Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina. In June Ashdown dismissed the Federation Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, Nikola Grabovac, while the Republika Srpska Minister of Finance, Milenko Vracar, tendered his resignation, following pressure from Ashdown, who had criticized official malpractice in both entities.</p>
                         <p>On 5 October 2002 elections were conducted to the state and Republika Srpska presidencies, the state and entity legislatures, and to the Federation cantonal assemblies. Sulejman Tihić of the SDA, Dragan Čović of the HDZ BiH and Šarović of the SDS were elected, respectively, as the Bosniak, Croat and Serb members of the state Presidency. Dragan Čavić of the SDS was elected President of Republika Srpska. The SDP BiH-led alliance lost its majority in the House of Representatives, and the SDA became the largest single party, with 10 seats. The SDA also secured the highest number of seats (32) in the Federation House of Representatives (which was reduced in size to 98 deputies), while the HDZ&#160;BiH-led alliance obtained 16 seats. The SDP BiH and the SBiH each won 15 seats. In the elections to the Republika Srpska National Assembly, the SDS obtained 26 seats, while the Savez Nezavisnih Socijaldemokrata (SNSD—Alliance of Independent Social Democrats—formerly the SNSRS) obtained 19. At the end of October both the Minister of Defence and the army Chief of the General Staff of Republika Srpska resigned, after it emerged that an aviation company owned by the Republika Srpska authorities had exported military equipment to Iraq, breaching UN sanctions. In December Ashdown introduced legislation to strengthen the powers of the state Government, under which two new ministries, of security and of justice, were to be established. At the end of 2002 the mandate of the UN Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina expired, and responsibility for peacekeeping was transferred to an EU Police Mission.</p>
                         <p>In January 2003 the House of Representatives approved the formation of a new state Government, an unprecedented coalition administration largely comprising members of the nationalist SDA, HDZ BiH and SDS, headed by Adnan Terzić of the SDA. Subsequently, the Republika Srpska National Assembly approved Čavić’s nomination of Dragan Mikerević of the PDP as entity Prime Minister, and the composition of a new Government in accordance with newly approved constitutional amendments on ethnic representation. Later that month the Federation House of Representatives elected Niko Lozančić, a Croat, to the Presidency, and a Bosniak and a Serb to the office of joint Vice-President. The appointment of a new Federation Government, led by Ahmet Hadžipašić, was approved in February.</p>
                         <p>On 2 April 2003 Šarović resigned as the Serb member of the state Presidency, having been implicated in illicit exports to Iraq and alleged espionage activities by the Republika Srpska military. Ashdown announced the abolition of the Republika Srpska Supreme Military Council, and removed all references of statehood from the Constitution of Republika Srpska. On 10 April the House of Representatives confirmed the nomination of Borislav Paravać, also of the SDS, to replace Šarović.</p>
                         <p>Meanwhile, on 27 February 2003 the ICTY sentenced Plavšić to 11 years’ imprisonment for crimes against humanity. In July a former Mayor of Prijedor, Milomir Stakić, was sentenced to life imprisonment by the ICTY for his involvement in the campaign of `ethnic cleansing’ of non-Serbs from the region in 1992-95.</p>

                         <p id="BA.IS.19048677655">In February 2004 Ashdown announced the dismissals of three Republika Srpska security officials and the removal of Šarović from the presidium of the SDS, owing to their suspected complicity in attempts to prevent Karadžić’s capture. The SDS refused to approve Šarović’s dismissal, and the party’s leader, Kalinić, subsequently resigned in protest against Ashdown’s decision. In June Ashdown dismissed 60 Republika Srpska officials, including the Minister of the Interior, who were believed to be hindering attempts to locate Karadžić. In September the ICTY sentenced Radislav Brđanin, the self-styled Deputy Prime Minister of Republika Srpska during 1992, to 32 years’ imprisonment for involvement in crimes committed against Croats and Bosniaks in the Krajina region. After a commission established to investigate the massacre at Srebrenica submitted a report acknowledging that Bosnian Serb forces had killed an estimated 7,800 male Bosniaks, in November 2004 the Republika Srpska Government issued an official apology for the `enormous crimes’ committed in Srebrenica.</p>
                         <p id="BA.IS.918475645">Following a UN Security Council resolution on 22 November 2004, in December SFOR transferred authority to a new, 7,000-member EU Force (EUFOR Operation Althea). Also in December, after NATO rejected for the second time Bosnia and Herzegovina’s application to join the `Partnership for Peace’ (PfP) programme, Ashdown announced the acceleration of military reforms: the entity Ministries of Defence were to be abolished by 2005, and a single police force was to replace the three existing police and security agencies. In addition, Ashdown removed nine Republika Srpska security officials accused of complicity in the evasion from arrest of war crime suspects. On 17 December 2004 Mikerević resigned as Prime Minister of Republika Srpska in protest against the dismissals. In February 2005 the Republika Srpska National Assembly approved a new, SDS-dominated Government headed by Pero Bukejlović of the SDP. Ashdown removed the Croat member of the state Presidency, Čović, from office in March, after he was charged with corruption; he was replaced in May by Ivo Miro Jović.</p>
                         <p id="BA.IS.1099000">The War Crimes Chamber of the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (established in January 2003 as the country’s highest judicial organ) commenced operations in March 2005. In July a special defence reform commission endorsed legislation providing for the establishment of a joint multi-ethnic army with a unified command structure; the entity Ministries of Defence and system of military conscription were to be abolished. In August the Republika Srpska National Assembly approved the transfer of entity defence powers to the state Government. Following a recommendation by the European Commissioner responsible for Enlargement, discussions on the signature of a Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the EU opened in November. The Federation and Republika Srpska Ministries of Defence and armed forces were officially dissolved on 1 January 2006, when authority over the military was transferred to the central state authorities.</p>
                         <p id="BA.IS.34589569">On 26 January 2006, after Ivanić announced the withdrawal of the PDP’s support for the Republika Srpska Government, a motion of no confidence was adopted against it in the entity legislature. On 31 January German politician Christian Schwarz-Schilling succeeded Ashdown as High Representative and EU Special Representative. On 4 February Čavić nominated Dodik as the new Prime Minister of Republika Srpska; Dodik’s administration was approved by the National Assembly on 28 February. In March, following the convening of US-supported discussions in Sarajevo in January, the principal parties reached agreement on a number of draft constitutional reforms. However, on 26 April the Parliamentary Assembly failed to approve the reforms by the requisite majority, after four dissenting HDZ BiH representatives formed a breakaway party, the Hrvatska Demokratska Zajednica 1990 BiH (HDZ 1990 BiH—Croatian Democratic Union 1990 of Bosnia and Herzegovina).</p>
                         <p>Elections at national, entity and cantonal level, held on 1 October 2006, were pronounced by the OSCE to have been conducted satisfactorily. In the ballot for the Bosniak member of the tripartite Presidency, Silajdžić was elected with 62.8% of the votes cast, defeating the incumbent Bosniak representative, Tihić. Nebojša Radmanović, a member of the SNSD, secured the post of Serb member of the Presidency, with 53.3% of the votes, while the SDS candidate took 24.2%. Željko Komšić won 39.6% of the votes, defeating the incumbent Croat member of the Pres­idency, Jović, who received 26.1%. In the elections to the 42-member House of Representatives, the SDA secured nine seats, while the SBiH increased its representation to eight seats, the SNSD obtained seven seats, and the SDP BiH five seats. The SDA also remained the leading party in the Federation House of Representatives, with 28 seats; the SBiH won 24 seats, and the SDP BiH 17 seats. The SNSD achieved the largest representation in the Republika Srpska National Assembly, with 41 seats, while the SDS won only 17 seats. Milan Jelić of the SNSD was elected to the Republika Srpska Presidency with 48.8% of the votes cast, defeating Čavić. In mid-November Jelić nominated Dodik as Prime Minister of Republika Srpska. Dodik renewed the ruling coalition of the SNSD with the PDP and SDA, and a Government was approved by the new National Assembly of Republika Srpska on 30 November.</p>
                         <p>Meanwhile, in October 2006 Krajišnik was convicted at the ICTY on five charges of crimes against humanity and sentenced to 27 years’ imprisonment; his sentence was subsequently reduced to a term of 20 years and he was granted early release in 2013. In December 2006 Bosnia and Herzegovina was admitted to NATO’s PfP programme. However, the ICTY Prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte, declared that the co-operation of the Bosnian authorities with the Tribunal remained unsatisfactory. Also in December, the EU announced a reduction in EUFOR troops, to 2,500 (further reduced to 600 in September 2012).</p>
                         <p>A state Council of Ministers, under the chairmanship of Nikola Špirić of the SNSD, was approved by the House of Representatives on 9 February 2007. In the same month the PIC announced that plans for the closure of the Office of the High Representative (OHR) at the end of June were to be abandoned, although Schwarz-Schilling was to leave the post as scheduled. A new coalition Federation Government, headed by Nedžad Branković of the SDA, was approved in the Federation House of Representatives on 30 March.</p>
                         <p>In May 2007 a former Bosnian Serb army officer and close associate of Mladić, Zdravko Tolimir, was arrested in Republika Srpska, and extradited to the ICTY. (Tolimir was sentenced to life imprisonment on charges of genocide relating to his involvement in the Srebrenica massacre in December 2012.) On 30 June 2007 a Slovakian diplomat, Miroslav Lajčák, succeeded Schwarz-Schilling as High Representative and EU Special Representative. Lajčák in October announced a number of measures for reforming parliamentary and government decision-making procedures, including new regulations to prevent representatives of one ethnic group from obstructing the adoption of legislation. On 1 November Špirić resigned from the state premiership, after the PIC expressed support for the reforms. At the end of November Bosnian Serb leaders ended resistance to the proposed legislation. Following an agreement by the political leaders to proceed with the police reforms in accordance with EU criteria, the SAA was initialled on 4 December.</p>
                         <p>On 9 December 2007 Rajko Kuzmanović of the SNSD was elected President of Republika Srpska, following Jelić’s death in September. On 28 December Špirić was reappointed to the state premiership. A police reform plan, proposed by Lajčák, was approved by both chambers of the state parliament in April 2008; the agreement abandoned plans for the creation of a single police force, providing instead for seven state-level co-ordination bodies with authority over the entity police forces. EU officials recognized the measure as satisfying the final requirement for signature of the SAA, which took place on 16 June; however, the agreement’s entry into force was subsequently suspended, owing to a lack of progress in implementing stipulated reforms.</p>

                         <p>In May 2008 Željko Mejakić, the Bosnian Serb commander of the Omarska detention camp, was sentenced by the ICTY to 21 years’ imprisonment, while two other officials received terms of 31 and 11 years, respectively. In June a former Bosnian Serb police commander and close aide to Karadžić and Mladić, Stojan Župljanin, was arrested in Serbia; he was transferred to the ICTY on charges relating to crimes committed against Croats and Bosniaks in the Bosnian Krajina region. (Župljanin and his associate, Mićo Stanišić, were sentenced to 22 years’ imprisonment in March 2013.) On 21 July 2008 Serbian Pres­ident Boris Tadić announced that Karadžić had been arrested in Belgrade by Serbian security officers. Karadžić was extradited to the ICTY on 30 July; he refused to recognize the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, claiming that he had been guaranteed immunity from prosecution if he left politics. In February 2009 the ICTY approved an amended indictment of 11 charges against Karadžić, including two counts of genocide, one related to war crimes in 1992 and one to the massacre at Srebrenica. On 24 March 2016 Karadžić was found guilty of 10 of the 11 counts against him, including the charge of genocide relating to the Srebrenica massacre (but was acquitted of the other genocide charge). He was sentenced to 40 years’ imprisonment. An appeal by Karadžić was rejected by an Appeals Chamber of the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals (IRMCT) at The Hague in March 2019, and his sentence was changed to life imprisonment.</p>
                         <p>Meanwhile, elections to municipal councils and mayoralties nationwide had been conducted on 5 October 2008. The SNSD again performed strongly in Republika Srpska, securing 39 mayoralties overall, including that of Banja Luka, while the SDA received 36 mayoralties and the HDZ BiH 16.</p>
                         <p>In January 2009 Lajčák announced his resignation from the OHR. Austrian diplomat Valentin Inzko succeeded him as High Representative and EU Special Representative in March (holding the latter post until September 2011, after which it was assigned separately). On 27 May 2009 Branković resigned as Prime Minister of the Federation, following charges against him and former premier Edhem Bičakčić of misappropriating entity funds. Mustafa Mujezinović of the SDA was approved as Federation Prime Minister on 25 June. In July Serb paramilitary leader Milan Lukić (extradited from Argentina in 2006) received a term of life imprisonment at the ICTY for war crimes committed in Višegrad. Plavšić (who had been transferred to a Swedish prison) was granted early release under Swedish law, with the approval of the ICTY, on 27 October 2009.</p>
                         <p>In December 2009 Inzko extended the mandate of international judges and prosecutors at the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, overruling a vote in the state legislature. His decision was rejected as unconstitutional by the Republika Srpska National Assembly. Later that month the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled that the state Constitution discriminated against minority ethnic groups, since only Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks were entitled to contest elections to the state Presidency and upper legislative chamber. Legislation allowing Republika Srpska wide-ranging powers on the organization of referendums was approved by the NationalAssembly in February 2010, and upheld by the entity’s Constitutional Court in April.</p>

                         <p>Elections to the state Presidency, the Presidency of Republika Srpska, the state and entity legislatures, and to the Federation cantonal assemblies were conducted on 3 October 2010. Bakir Izetbegović (the son of Alija Izetbegović, and regarded as a moderate) of the SDA was elected as the Bosniak member of the state Presidency, while Komšić and Radmanović were re-elected as the Croat and Serb members, respectively. Dodik was elected as Pres­ident of Republika Srpska, with 50.5% of the votes cast. In the elections to the House of Representatives, the SDP BiH and the SNSD each won eight seats, while the SDA received seven seats. The SDP BiH increased its representation in the Federation House of Representatives to 28 seats, replacing the SDA (23 seats) as the leading party in the chamber. The SNSD remained the dominant party in the Republika Srpska National Assembly, with 37 seats, while the SDS received 18 seats.</p>
                         <p>The three members of the state Presidency were sworn in on 10 November 2010, and five days later Dodik was inaugurated as President of Republika Srpska. On 29 December the National Assembly approved a new Government, headed by Aleksandar Džombić, hitherto the entity Minister of Finance, and principally comprising representatives of the SNSD. On 17 March 2011 the Dom Naroda Federacije (Federation House of Peoples—upper chamber of the Federation legislature) elected Živko Budimir of the extreme nationalist Hrvatska Stranka Prava BiH (HSP BiH—Croatian Party of Rights of Bosnia and Herzegovina) as Federation President and endorsed a new Government, largely comprising members of the SDP BiH and the SDA, and under the premiership of Nermin Nikšić of the SDP BiH. Following their boycott of the entity’s new legislature, the HDZ BiH and HDZ 1990 denounced the election as illegitimate.</p>
                         <p>On 26 May 2011 Serbian security forces arrested Mladić in a village in northern Serbia; following extradition to the ICTY, his trial commenced on 3 June. In December the six main political party leaders reached agreement on the composition of a new state Council of Ministers. Headed by Vjekoslav Bevanda of the HDZ BiH, a former Vice-President of the Federation, it was approved on 10 February 2012, with Lagumdžija as Minister of Foreign Affairs and Špirić as Minister of Finance and the Treasury. However, in May the SDA rejected the state budget for that year. The SDP BiH subsequently formed a new alliance with the Savez za Bolju Budućnost (SBB—Union for a Better Future), and demanded that the SDA representatives in the Council of Ministers be replaced. In October the SDA ministers responsible for defence and security were dismissed, and in the following month SBB leader Fahrudin Radončić was appointed as Minister of Security. Meanwhile, local elections were held on 7 October. The mandate of Mostar’s City Council expired in November, following the postponement of polls there due to disagreement between the local branches of the HDZ BiH and the SDA over stipulated changes to the electoral system.</p>
                         <p>Amid deteriorating economic conditions in Republika Srpska, on 27 February 2013 Džombić submitted the resignation of his Government, citing differences with Dodik. On the same day Dodik designated Željka Cviljanović of the SNSD, hitherto Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economic Affairs and Regional Co-operation, as premier. The National Assembly approved the new Government on 12 March.</p>
                         <p>
            On 26 April 2013 Federation President Budimir and 18 other officials were arrested on charges of corruption and accepting bribes. However, Budimir was released one month later, due to a lack of evidence, and remained in office. In May Jadranko Prlić, the `Prime Minister’ of the unrecognized Bosnian Croat state of `Herceg-Bosna’ in 1992-96, was sentenced to 25 years’ imprisonment for war crimes by the ICTY. The country’s first post-conflict census was conducted during 1-15 October 2013, in compliance with a principal EU requirement. However, the main political parties failed to meet a deadline of 1 October that had been imposed for adoption of the constitutional amendments required by the ECHR ruling of 2009.

                         <p>On 5 February 2014 anti-Government protests in the industrial town of Tuzla in response to the closure of privatized businesses erupted into violence. Demonstrations of support in Sarajevo, Mostar and other major towns in the Federation also became violent, and were forcibly suppressed by police. In March the House of Representatives voted to remove Radončić as Minister of Security.</p>
                         <p>On 12 October 2014 elections were conducted to the state and Republika Srpska presidencies and to the state and entity legislatures. The elections to the House of Representatives demonstrated renewed support for nationalist parties, while the representation of the SDP BiH declined significantly: the SDA took 18.7% of the votes and 10 seats, the SNSD 15.6% and six seats, and the SDS 13.0% and five seats. Bakir Izetbegović of the SDA was re-elected, with 32.9% of votes cast, as the Bosniak member of the state Presidency. Čović, representing the HDZ BiH, was elected as the Croat member, receiving 52.2% of the votes; and Ivanić, supported by an electoral coalition comprising the PDP and the SDS, secured 48.7% and was elected as the Serb member, narrowly defeating Željka Cvijanović, who represented an SNSD-led coalition. Dodik was re-elected to the Presidency of Republika Srpska, with 45.2% of the votes cast, narrowly defeating Ognjen Tadić of the SDS, who received 44.2%. The SNSD won 32.2% of the votes and 29 seats in the elections to the Republika Srpska National Assembly, while an alliance led by the SDS and the Srpska Radikalna Stranka Republike Srpske (Serbian Radical Party of Republika Srpska) received 26.2% and 24 seats. The SDA replaced the SDP BiH as the leading party in the Federation House of Representatives, securing 27.8% of the votes and 29 seats, followed by the SBB, which obtained 14.7% and 16 seats. In December former Federation premier Nikšić was elected Chairman of the SDP BiH, following the resignation of Lagumdžija. On 18 December the Republika Srpska National Assembly endorsed a new Government, led by Željka Cvijanović of the SNSD.</p>
                         <p>Meanwhile, in November 2014 the British and German foreign ministers presented an offer for the resumption of the EU integration process, together with the provision of financial assistance, if Bosnian politicians pledged their commitment to significant reforms. On 29 January 2015 the state Presidency signed a revised joint declaration reaffirming its commitment to reforms required for EU integration. Both chambers of the state Parliamentary Assembly adopted the declaration of commitment on 23 February. On 16 March EU ministers responsible for foreign affairs agreed to proceed with the long-delayed implementation of the SAA (which entered into effect on 1 June).</p>
                         <p>On 9 February 2015 the Federation Parliament elected Marinko Čavara of the HDZ BiH as the entity’s President. The House of Representatives approved the appointment of Denis Zvizdić of the SDA as Chairman of the state Council of Ministers on 11 February. After further protracted discussions, on 31 March the Parliamentary Assembly approved a state Council of Ministers headed by Zvizdić. On the same day Čavara nominated a new Federation Government under the premiership of businessman Fadil Novalić of the SDA, which was approved by the Federation Parliament.</p>
                         <p>In June 2015 the Demokratska Fronta Bosne i Hercegovine (DF—Democratic Front of Bosnia and Herzegovina—formed by Komšić) announced its withdrawal from the Federation Government, after the two other main coalition parties voted to adopt a new regulation under which the Government (rather than the relevant ministers) would appoint heads of state-controlled companies. Radončić’s SBB agreed to join the ruling coalition, and the appointment of SBB members to four vacant ministerial posts previously held by DF representatives was approved on 28 October. (The DF subsequently also withdrew from the state Government.)</p>

                         <heading>Republika Srpska Referendum</heading>
                         <p>Although Republika Srpska leaders initially refused to sign an action plan in accordance with the declaration of commitment with the EU, on 24 July 2015 the state Presidency and the Governments of both entities approved reform legislation; a socioeconomic reform agenda required to advance the country’s EU accession process was subsequently adopted. However, again at the instigation of Dodik, on 15 July the Republika Srpska National Assembly voted to organize a referendum on the jurisdiction of state-level courts and the OHR in the entity; the decision was upheld by the Constitutional Court of Republika Srpska on 9 September. In November Bosnian Serb parties strongly criticized a state Constitutional Court decision to annul an official holiday in Republika Srpska on 9 January marking the anniversary of the declaration of the polity, on the grounds that it represented a form of discrimination against non-Serb ethnic groups in the entity. The Day of Republika Srpska was, nevertheless, celebrated in Banja Luka on 9 January 2016. Following continued international pressure, in February Dodik announced that the planned referendum in Republika Srpska would be postponed until all Serb parties in the entity agreed to the proposal.</p>
                         <p>Despite a boycott by its Bosniak deputies, on 15 July 2016 the Republika Srpska National Assembly adopted a resolution in favour of organizing a referendum on the Day of Republika Srpska issue. Although there were continued protests, including from Inzko, that the plebiscite would contravene the Dayton Agreement, it proceeded on 25 September. The results indicated that 99.8% of votes in the entity, cast by 55.8% of the electorate, were in favour of 9 January being celebrated as the Day of Republika Srpska.</p>
                         <p>Local elections were conducted on 2 October 2016, with a participation rate of 53.9%. Overall, the SDA won 32 mayoral offices, the HDZ BiH obtained 19, while the SNSD strengthened its position, also securing 32 mayoralties, and the representation of the SDS declined to 16 mayoralties. Notably, Mladen Grujičić became the first ethnic Serb Mayor of Srebrenica, while former member of the state Presidency Fikret Abdić, who had been imprisoned for 10 years in Croatia (and who was originally sentenced to 20 years in prison following war crimes charges), was elected Mayor of Velika Kladuša.</p>
                         <p>At the beginning of December 2016 the state Constitutional Court annulled the results of the Republika Srpska referendum on the grounds that it had previously been prohibited by the Court. Nevertheless, the Day of Republika Srpska was celebrated in Banja Luka on 9 January 2017 (and in subsequent years). In November the Republika Srpska National Assembly voted to suspend the 2015 decision to conduct a referendum challenging the state-level judiciary.</p>
                         <p>

            Following intensifying inter-party acrimony, on 21 July 2017 the SBB announced that it had ended co-operation with the SDA in the state and federation ruling coalitions, accusing its Chairman, Izetbegović, of being responsible for allegations in 2016 that SBB leader Radončić had attempted to intimidate a witness in a drug trafficking trial in Kosovo. (He was acquitted of the charge in May 2018.) Also in July 2017 the Constitutional Court ruled that parts of the legislation detailing the legal basis for the election of the Federation House of Peoples were unconstitutional (after a decision by the Court in December 2016 upholding HDZ BiH demands for changes to the electoral system).
          </p>
                         <p>On 22 November 2017 the ICTY sentenced Mladić to life imprisonment on 10 charges: one of genocide (relating to acts against the Bosniak population of Srebrenica), five of crimes against humanity, and four of violations of the laws or customs of war; he was acquitted of one count of genocide in Bosnian municipalities outside Srebrenica. Later in November the ICTY upheld prison sentences imposed on the six former `Herceg-Bosna’ officials in 2013; in protest against the verdict, one of the defendants, Slobodan Praljak, died after drinking poison in court. Bosnian Croat leaders denounced the judgment, and vigils for Praljak were staged in Mostar and elsewhere.</p>

                         <heading>The 2018 Elections and Political Impasse</heading>
                         <p>In March 2018 the death of a student near Banja Luka prompted a public outcry, after claims by his family that he had been murdered by police and that senior officials, including Republika Srpska Minister of Internal Affairs Dragan Lukač, had attempted to conceal the crime. A series of public protests against the authorities ensued in Banja Luka, and subsequently in other towns in May. However, in July the Republika Srpska National Assembly rejected the results of an official inquiry, which had concluded that there was evidence of murder. At Dodik’s instigation, in August the National Assembly annulled the 2004 report on the 1995 Srebrenica massacre and ordered the entity’s Government to form an international commission to produce a new document, prompting denunciations from Bosniak politicians.</p>
                         <p>Elections to the state Presidency, the Presidency of Republika Srpska, the state and entity legislatures, and to the Federation cantonal assemblies were conducted on 7 October 2018. The SDA remained the leading party in the House of Representatives, with nine seats, while the SNSD retained six seats; an HDZ BiH-led coalition and the SDP BiH both increased their representation to five seats, while that of the SDS Lista declined to three seats. The SDA also retained its dominance in the Federation House of Representatives, obtaining 27 seats, although the SDP BiH and the HDZ BiH-led coalition both increased their representation to 16 seats. The SNSD, meanwhile, strengthened its lead in the Republika Srpska National Assembly, with 28 seats, while an SDS-led alliance obtained 16 seats. Dodik was elected as the Serb member of the state Presidency, with 53.9% of the votes cast, and was succeeded as President of Republika Srpska by the entity’s former premier, Cvijanović, who secured 47.0%. Šefik Džaferović of the SDA was narrowly elected as the Bosniak member of the state Presidency, with 36.6% of the votes. The election of Komšić of the DF as the Croat member of the state Presidency, with 52.6% of the votes, attracted some controversy; his defeat over the incumbent, Čović of the HDZ BiH (with 36.1%), was largely attributed to the support of Bosniak votes and consequently prompted protests by Croats in Mostar.</p>
                         <p>
            On 18 December 2018 the Republika Srpska National Assembly approved a new Government for the entity, headed by Radovan Višković of the SNSD. On the same day the Central Election Commission (CEC) announced a decision to amend procedural legislation relating to the election of the Federation House of Peoples, resolving a political impasse; however, the SDA brought a challenge against the decision at the Constitutional Court, thereby delaying the establishment of a new legislature in the Federation. 
            <!--https://balkaninsight.com/2019/02/20/bosnias-federation-entity-finally-forms-new-parliament/-->
            After the Constitutional Court ruled that it had no jurisdiction over the CEC’s decision, on 20 February 2019 the Federation House of Peoples was finally formed; deputies were also elected to the state-level upper legislative chamber.
          </p>
                         <p>In October 2019 the ECHR ruled that the state electoral law should be amended within six months to bring it into conformity with a 2010 Constitutional Court ruling on voting arrangements in Mostar and enable the long-delayed local elections to be held there. On 19 November, following a meeting with EU and US delegates, the tripartite Presidency agreed to appoint Zoran Tegeltija, a former Republika Srpska Minister of Finance who had been nominated by the SNSD, as the new Chairman of the state Council of Ministers. His appointment was approved by the state House of Representatives on 5 December. A new state Council of Ministers, proposed by Tegeltija, was approved by 29 votes in the House of Representatives on 23 December, ending the impasse. The SDA received only one ministerial post, that of Deputy Chairman and Minister of Foreign Affairs, while Radončić again became Minister of Security. The Constitutional Court ruled on 7 February 2020 that public land was the property of the state, rather than the entities, ruling against a newly adopted Republika Srpska law claiming ownership of agricultural land. In response, on 17 February Republika Srpska representatives suspended participation in state-level institutions.</p>

                         <p>In March 2020 the state Council of Ministers announced a national state of emergency and the creation of a state-level body to oversee the co-ordination of measures between the entities. Meanwhile, Dodik partially suspended the Republika Srpska boycott of state-level institutions. The national and entity-level states of emergency remained in force until late May. On 2 June Radončić announced his resignation as state Minister of Security, after his proposal for the deportation of around 9,500 migrants on security grounds was opposed by other members of the Government. He was replaced by a former army officer, Selmo Cikotić of the SDA, on 23 July.</p>
                         <p>
            On 17 June 2020 the SDA and the HDZ BiH signed an internationally mediated agreement in Mostar on a new electoral statute for the city, providing for the organization of the long-delayed local elections there. Amendments to the state electoral law relating to Mostar were adopted by the House of Peoples on 8 July, and later that month it was announced that a new 35-member City Council for Mostar would be elected on 20 December. 
            <!--https://www.ndi.org/publications/bih-local-elections-2020-tectonic-changes-or-taking-positions-elections-2022-->
            Nationwide local elections were conducted on 15 November; a participation rate of around 51% was reported. The SNSD secured 44 of the 143 mayoral posts, the SDA won 26 and the HDZ BiH obtained 21. Voting proceeded in Mostar on 20 December;

            following a recount of votes in a number of constituencies where irregularities were reported, final results were released, according to which the HDZ BiH was narrowly first-placed, securing 13 of the 35 seats in the City Council.
          </p>
                         <p>After Inzko had confirmed his forthcoming retirement as High Representative, on 20 January 2021 Germany nominated Christian Schmidt, a member of the German parliament and a former government minister, to the post. Meanwhile, on 21 January the CEC, citing irregularities, annulled most of the local election results in the Republika Srpska towns of Srebrenica and Doboj, where SNSD candidates had been successful. Following an acrimonious dispute between Dodik and members of the CEC, repeated polls on 21 February resulted in the re-election of Grujičić as Mayor in Srebrenica, and of another SNSD mayoral candidate in Doboj. Meanwhile, the HDZ BiH candidate, Mario Kordić, was narrowly elected Mayor of Mostar on 15 February.</p>

                         <p>In June 2021 the IRMCT rejected an appeal by Mladić and delivered a verdict confirming his life sentence. Also in June the IRMCT sentenced two senior wartime Serbian state security officials to 12 years’ imprisonment for involvement in war crimes perpetrated by a state security special unit in the Bosanski Šamac area of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1992; it was the first time that senior Serbian officials from the Milošević era had been convicted of war crimes in Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
                         <p>On 22 July 2021 outgoing High Representative Inzko imposed amendments to the country’s criminal code prohibiting the denial of genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes, and the extension of any award or honour to war criminals, in response to the increasing frequency of such actions; offenders were to be liable to prison sentences of up to five years. The amendments entered into force six days later. In response, Dodik withdrew all Republika Srpska officials from participation in state institutions. Schmidt, who succeeded Inzko as High Representative on 1 August, warned of an intensifying political crisis, as Dodik threatened to withdraw Republika Srpska from previous agreements, including on the national joint armed forces (which would effectively re-establish a separate entity army). He also announced plans to draft a new constitution for Republika Srpska and to reject all decisions issued by High Representatives. Legislation that was adopted in Republika Srpska formally rejected the application of the amendments to the criminal code. On 10 December the Republika Srpska National Assembly voted in favour of initiating a procedure to withdraw from the central army, security services, tax administration and judiciary.</p>
                         <p>On 24 February 2022, when Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, it was announced that EUFOR was to be reinforced by some 500 troops (to number 1,100), with the aim of preventing potential instability. Bosnia and Herzegovina supported a UN General Assembly resolution, adopted on 2 March, denouncing the Russian invasion and demanding the withdrawal of its forces from Ukraine. However, the Bosnian Government failed to join economic and financial sanctions that were imposed by the EU against Russia, owing to the opposition of Dodik (who had close links with Russian President Vladimir Putin) within the tripartite Presidency, and of his SNSD within the state Council of Ministers. On 6 June Dodik announced that the planned Bosnian Serb withdrawal from Bosnia and Herzegovina’s state structures was to be delayed owing to the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Meanwhile, contention between Bosniak and Croat parties in the Federation over procedures for voting in the forthcoming elections intensified.</p>

                         <p>Elections to the state Presidency, which took place together with polls to the Presidency of Republika Srpska, the state and entity legislatures, and the Federation cantonal assemblies on 2 October 2022, resulted in some gains for moderate candidates. Denis Bećirović of the SDP BiH, who was supported by an 11-party alliance, was elected as the Bosniak member of the state Presidency with 57.4% of the votes cast, defeating the nationalist incumbent, Izetbegović of the SDA (37.3%), while the incumbent Croat member, Komšić of the DF, securing 55.8%, defeated a challenge by Borjana Krišto of the HDZ BiH (44.2%). However, the hitherto President of Republika Srpska, Cvijanović of the SNSD (a close ally of Dodik), succeeded him as the Serb member of the Presidency, with 51.7% of the votes, defeating Šarović of the SDS (35.5%). The composition of the state House of Representatives was largely unchanged: the leading parties were the SDA, which retained nine seats, the SNSD, which retained six, and the SDP BiH with five, while an HDZ BiH-led coalition took four seats. At the elections to the Federation House of Representatives, the leading parties also remained the SDA, which secured 24.4% of the votes and 26 seats, the SDP BiH and the HDZ BiH-led coalition, which each won 15 seats, with 13.5% and 13.4% of the votes, respectively; a coalition of the DF and the Građanski Savez (Civic Alliance) secured 11.0% of the votes and 12 seats. In the elections to the Republika Srpska National Assembly, the SNSD likewise remained dominant, with 34.6% of the votes and 29 seats, while the SDS received 15.0% and 13 seats. The PDP won 10.3% of the votes and eight seats. In the Republika Srpska presidential election, SNSD candidate Dodik secured 47.1% of the votes, and his principal opponent, Jelena Trivić of the PDP (representing a PDP-SDS alliance), won 42.8%. Following allegations of electoral malpractice on behalf of Dodik, the CEC conducted a recount of the preliminary results for Republika Srpska, but on 22 October confirmed the presidential and parliamentary results for the entity.</p>
                         <p>
            Meanwhile, immediately after the polls closed, High Representative Schmidt controversially announced the introduction of significant reforms to the country’s election law and to the Constitution of the Federation, with the stated aim of preventing the obstruction of appointments and other processes. The changes, 
            <i>inter alia</i>
            , provided for an increase in the size of the Federation House of Peoples from 58 to 80 members (with the allocation of representatives rising from 17 to 23 per constituent people), and imposed deadlines for reaching agreement on the composition of key indirectly elected institutions of government. The decisions were perceived by critics principally to benefit the HDZ BiH and the SNSD, and prompted protests in Sarajevo on 24 October 2022. (In early December the Constitutional Court rejected two appeals for the suspension of electoral changes imposed by Schmidt, which had been brought, respectively, by Komšić and a former Bosniak member of the Presidency.)
          </p>
                         <p>
            The HDZ BiH, the SNSD and an alliance of eight parties, including the SDP BiH, signed a coalition agreement on 29 November 2022 that provided for a co-operative government programme, and designated Krišto, the deputy leader of the HDZ BiH, to chair the state Council of Ministers. On 21 December a new Republika Srpska Government, again under the premiership of Višković, was approved by the entity’s National Assembly. Meanwhile, the incumbent state Minister of Human Rights and Refugees, Miloš Lučić (a Serb representative), resigned following his arrest on charges of corruption. Krišto’s official nomination as Chairman of the Council of Ministers by the Presidency was approved by the state House of Representatives on 28 December. The National Assembly on the same day adopted a law that provided for public institutions and services in Republika Srpska to become the sole property of the entity, rather than the state (a law that had been previously adopted but annulled by the Constitutional Court in September). The Day of Republika Srpska was celebrated with a military parade in East Sarajevo on 9 January 2023; on the previous day Dodik had awarded the Order of Republika Srpska to Russian President Putin, 
            <i>in absentia</i>
            , drawing further condemnation from the EU and the USA. Although two parties had withdrawn from the state-level government coalition, demanding the withdrawal of Republika Srpska’s new law on state property, the formation of the new state-level Council of Ministers was finalized on 25 January, with its narrow approval by 23 deputies in the state House of Representatives. Zukan Helez of the SDP BiH was appointed Deputy Chairman and Minister of Defence, and Tegeltija became Deputy Chairman and Minister of Finance and the Treasury.
          </p>
                         <p>Lidija Bradara was elected President of the Federation on 28 February 2023. In early April former Federation premier Novalić was sentenced to four years’ imprisonment, having been found guilty, together with two associates, of corruption in relation to the acquisition of hospital ventilators for COVID-19 patients in 2020; Federation Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Jelka Miličević was acquitted of the charges. In order to resolve an impasse in forming a new government in the Federation, on 27 April Schmidt imposed further amendments to the Constitution of the Federation (together with changes to the entities’ criminal laws), requiring only two of the three members of the Federation Presidency to support a proposed administration. A new Government, led by Nermin Niksić of the SDP, received legislative approval by the Federation House of Representatives on the following day, and was sworn in on 3 May.</p>

                         <heading>Recent Developments: New Republika Srpska Laws</heading>
                         <p>On 23 March 2023 the National Assembly of Republika Srpska approved draft legislation reinstating defamation to the criminal code; the law was passed in late July. Schmidt expressed concern about a joint statement signed on 24 April by the governing parties in Republika Srpska, which, he stated, appeared to establish preconditions for eventual secession. Subsequently, on 21 June the Republika Srpska National Assembly voted to end an obligation to publish officially decisions made by the OHR, with the effect that they would no longer enter into force in the entity. Furthermore, the National Assembly on 27 June approved a law withdrawing the recognition of rulings by the state-level Constitutional Court, and demanding that the Court be reconstituted without foreign judges (three of its judges being selected by the ECHR); Serb representatives in state institutions were to boycott any discussions on EU integration reforms until the entity’s demands were met. The vote had been initiated by Dodik shortly after changes to regulations made by the Constitutional Court allowing it to convene without the attendance of the Republika Srpska judges. Both decisions were denounced by Schmidt as violations of the General Framework Agreement for Peace of 1995. At the beginning of July he implemented measures to annul both laws and to terminate legislative procedures towards their adoption, also introducing amendments to the criminal code. Nevertheless, in August proposed legislation on the Constitutional Court, under which the mandate of foreign judges would be terminated, was presented in the state Council of Ministers by its Serb members. On 6 September Dodik announced that Schmidt would be arrested and expelled from Republika Srpska if he entered its territory (although subsequent visits took place without incident).</p>
                         <p>Meanwhile, after Tegeltija resigned from the state Government (due to his appointment to another official post), in August 2023 Staša Košarac and Srđan Amidžić, both members of the SNSD, were appointed, respectively as Deputy Chairman and Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Relations, and Minister of Finance and the Treasury. In October the Republika Srpska Government began public consultations on a draft law that would restrict the work of non-profit organizations, designate them as `foreign agents’ and subject them to increased oversight. In a report presented to the UN Secretary-General in early November, Schmidt accused Dodik and the Republika Srpska institutions of carrying out `an unprecedented attack’ on the country’s constitutional and legal order.</p>
                         <p>On 18 December 2023 the former head of the country’s Intelligence Security Agency, Osman Mehmedagić, and the President of the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ranko Debevec, were arrested for suspected abuse of office, in connection with a state prosecution investigation into the illegal monitoring of communications by judges and prosecutors in 2020. Despite warnings from EU and OSCE representatives, on 9 January 2024 the Day of Republika Srpska was again celebrated in Banja Luka; on the eve of the military parade two US fighter jets flew over the country in a demonstration of support for its territorial integrity.</p>

            Bosnia and Herzegovina established diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia in December 2000, following the overthrow of Slobodan Milošević. In February 2006 the 
            <xr pageref="Y" ref="IO-UN.527">International Court of Justice (ICJ)</xr>
             at The Hague, Netherlands, began consideration of an appeal brought in 1993 by Bosnia and Herzegovina against Yugoslavia (represented by Serbia, as its successor state), claiming reparations for acts of genocide perpetrated against the Bosniak population. In February 2007 the ICJ ruled that Serbia was not directly responsible for genocide or complicity in genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but that the state was in violation of its obligation under international law in having failed to prevent the 1995 massacre in Srebrenica and to co-operate fully with the ICTY. On 31 March 2010 the Serbian legislature adopted a resolution condemning the July 1995 Srebrenica massacre and formally apologizing for Serbia’s failure to prevent it. Following discussions between the Bosnian and Serbian Ministers of Foreign Affairs, with Turkish mediation, in April 2010 Chairman of the Bosnian collective Presidency Silajdžić and the Serbian President, Boris Tadić, met in İstanbul, Türkiye, where they pledged to improve bilateral relations and to resolve outstanding disputes. In November 2013 the Bosnian and Serbian Governments signed a security agreement.

                         <p>Meanwhile, a `special relations’ agreement was signed by Republika Srpska and Serbia in September 2006. Following Kosovo’s unilateral declaration of independence from Serbia on 17 February 2008, the Bosnian Presidency announced that it would not extend recognition to Kosovo in the near future, owing to the opposition of the Serb population. Large-scale protests against Kosovo’s independence were staged in Banja Luka, and the Republika Srpska National Assembly adopted a resolution denouncing the declaration. At a ceremony marking the 20th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre, held near Srebrenica on 11 July 2010, Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vučić was obliged to flee from violent protesters, causing the Serbian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to issue a formal complaint. The members of the Bosnian Presidency met Vučić in Serbia later in July, in an effort to ease strains. In February, with the support of the Bosniak member of the tripartite Presidency, Bakir Izetbegović, an appeal was lodged at the ICJ against the 2007 verdict clearing Serbia of direct responsibility for genocide. However, on 9 March 2017 the ICJ rejected the appeal, on the grounds that it had been opposed by the Serb member of the Presidency and other Serb leaders, and therefore did not represent a decision on behalf of the state.</p>
                         <p>
            In June 2013 Bosnian and Croatian government representatives, meeting in Brussels, signed an agreement on several bilateral issues prior to Croatia’s scheduled accession to the EU, including Bosnia and Herzegovina’s continued use of the Croatian port of Ploče and on Croatian transit traffic through the Bosnian coastal town of Neum. In late 2014 a dispute arose with Montenegro over a draft border agreement between the two countries, after a resolution proposed by an opposition deputy in the Bosnian state legislature demanded that the Montenegrin coastal area of Sutorina be ceded to Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, in May 2015 the House of Representatives rejected the resolution, and the border demarcation agreement was signed by the Governments of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro in August. In October 2016 Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenković visited Bosnia and Herzegovina in an attempt to ease political tensions over the status of Bosnian Croats, after references were made in Croatia during the legislative electoral campaign that were interpreted as expressing support for the re-establishment of a Croat state of `Herceg-Bosna’. However, shortly afterwards, 10 Bosnian Croat former officers were arrested on suspicion of committing war crimes against Serbs in the north-eastern town of Orašje during 1992-93, prompting protests from both Croatian and Bosnian Croat officials. Following the suicide of a Bosnian Croat war crimes indictee as the ICTY’s verdict against him was upheld (see 
            <i>Domestic Political Affairs</i>
            ), Plenković again visited Bosnia and Herzegovina in December 2017 in an attempt to appease outrage from the country’s Croat community at the ruling. The Croatian Government, in support of Bosnian Croat parties, was strongly critical of the election of DF leader Komšić as the Croat member of the state Presidency in October 2018, prompting further accusations of interference from the Bosnian authorities.

                         <p>In November 2010 the EU agreed to end visa requirements for citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with effect from mid-December. In June 2012 a dialogue on Bosnia and Herzegovina’s EU accession process officially began in Brussels, where agreement was reached on a `roadmap’ for the country’s membership application; however, the main political parties subsequently failed to adopt constitutional reforms by the deadlines stipulated. Nevertheless, under a new EU initiative, a declaration of commitment to political reform was adopted by the state Parliamentary Assembly on 23 February 2015, and an SAA with the EU entered into effect on 1 June. Following the further adoption of a reform agenda by the authorities in July, a formal application for EU membership was submitted on 15 February 2016; EU ministers responsible for foreign affairs accepted the application on 20 September. In May 2019 the European Commission issued its formal opinion on the country’s application, detailing 14 priorities to be fulfilled before accession negotiations could commence. Meanwhile, in December 2018 NATO approved the activation of a long-delayed Membership Action Plan (MAP) for Bosnia and Herzegovina (waiving a condition that all defence property be registered to the central Bosnian authorities).</p>
                         <p>
            In October 2022 the European Commission recommended that Bosnia and Herzegovina be granted the status of candidate country for EU membership, contingent on further reforms. In compliance with these requirements, the state Council of Ministers in early December adopted a comprehensive strategy on migration and asylum under which it was to tighten border controls. On 15 December the European Council confirmed the recommendation of the European Commission and granted Bosnia and Herzegovina official candidate status. In November 2023 the Commission recommended the opening of EU accession negotiations with Bosnia Herzegovina `once the necessary degree of compliance with the membership criteria’ had been achieved. 
            <!--https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_23_5613-->
            According to a report issued by the Commission in that month, the state-level Government installed in January had taken significant reform measures, including the adoption of strategies and action plans to combat organized crime and terrorism, and on migration management. A law on freedom of access to information and legislation designating the human rights Ombudsman as the national preventive mechanism against torture and ill-treatment received legislative approval in August. However, the actions of the Republika Srpska Government (see 
            <i>Domestic Political Affairs</i>
            ) continued to impede state-level progress towards EU membership. In January 2024 an EU delegation, comprising President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, Croatian premier Plenković and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, met Bosnian leaders in Sarajevo. On 21 March the European Council approved a further recommendation by the Commission for the opening of membership negotiations, subject to reform progress.

                         <p>
            Following Republika Srpska’s threatened withdrawal from state institutions (see 
            <i>Domestic Political Affairs</i>
            ), in January 2022 the US Administration of Joe Biden imposed new sanctions against Dodik (then the Serb member of the Presidency), stating that his actions threatened to destabilize Bosnia and Herzegovina. The USA on 6 June also introduced sanctions against Čavara, the HDZ BiH President of the Federation, and another Republika Srpska official, who were both accused of pursuing `ethnonationalist and political agendas’. In October 2023 the US Treasury Department imposed sanctions against Dodik’s adult children, and further US sanctions closed down the websites of government institutions, the presidency, the civil service and the inspection administration in Republika Srpska; in November the US imposed additional sanctions against Bosnian politicians, including the Republika Srpska Minister of Energy and Mining, Petar Đokić, accused of endangering regional security, and the head of the entity’s representative office in the Russian capital, Moscow, Duško Perović, for seeking to facilitate contacts between Dodik and President Putin. However, on 19 November NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg arrived in Sarajevo for his first official visit to Bosnia and Herzegovina.

               <p id="BA.IS.69">In accordance with the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina (`the Dayton accords’), of December 1995, Bosnia and Herzegovina is a single state, which consists of two autonomous entities: the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska. In March 2000, following completion of a demilitarization process, the north-eastern town of Brčko was established as a neutral district and placed under joint Serb, Croat and Bosniak authority. Its status was confirmed under a constitutional amendment adopted in March 2009. A civilian High Representative of the International Community in Bosnia and Herzegovina oversees government institutions and the implementation of the peace accords. The state Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina has a three-member collective Presidency consisting of one Bosniak, one Croat and one Serb. Members of the Presidency are directly elected for a term of four years, and are eligible to serve for only two consecutive terms. Chairmanship of the Presidency is rotated between the members every eight months. The bicameral Parlamentarna Skupština Bosne i Hercegovine (Bosnia and Herzegovina Parliamentary Assembly) comprises the Dom Naroda (House of Peoples) and the Pred­stavnički Dom/Zastupnički Dom (House of Representatives). The House of Representatives has 42 deputies, who serve for a four-year term, of whom 28 are directly elected from the Federation and 14 are directly elected from Republika Srpska. The House of Peoples has 15 deputies, who serve for a four-year term, of whom 10 are selected by the Federation’s legislature and five by the Republika Srpska legislature. The Presidency appoints a Chairman of the state Council of Ministers (subject to the approval of the House of Representatives), who subsequently appoints the other ministers.</p>
               <p id="BA.IS.70">
        The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska each retain an executive presidency, government and legislature. The bicameral Parlament Federacije (Federation Parliament) has a 98-member Predstavnički Dom Federacije/Zastupnički Dom Federacije (Federation House of Representatives), which is directly elected for a four-year term, and

               <p>
        The legislature of Republika Srpska comprises an 83-member Narodna Skupština Republike Srpske (Republika Srpska National Assembly), which is directly elected for a four-year term. This Assembly elects 28 delegates, of whom eight are Bosniaks, eight Croats, eight Serbs, and four representatives of other ethnic groups, to a Vijeće Naroda (Council of Peoples), which is responsible, 
        <i>inter alia</i>
        , for electing the entity’s representatives to the House of Peoples. The President and two Vice-Presidents of Republika Srpska are directly elected, for a four-year term.

In 2022 the principal source of imports was Italy (which accounted for 12.4% of the total); other important suppliers were Serbia, Germany, Croatia and the People’s Republic of China. Croatia was the main market for exports (accounting
        
         for 14.9%); other significant purchasers were Germany, Serbia, Italy, Austria and Slovenia. The principal imports in 2022 were basic manufactures, machinery and transport equipment, mineral fuels and lubricants, chemicals and related products, food and live animals, and miscellaneous manufactured articles.

               <p id="BA.IS.83">Bosnia and Herzegovina’s overall budget deficit for 2021 was KM&#160;321.1m. General government gross debt was KM 13,514m. in 2022, equivalent to 29.7% of GDP. The country’s total external debt was estimated at US&#160;$12,986m. in 2021, of which $5,058m. was public and publicly guaranteed debt. In that year the cost of servicing long-term public and publicly guaranteed debt and repayments to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was equivalent to about 13.8% of the value of exports of goods, services and income (excluding workers’ remittances). According to the IMF, inflation increased at an average annual rate of 1.5% during 2013-22. Consumer prices increased by 2.0% in 2021 and by 14.0% in 2022, according to the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Provisional data indicated that the rate of unemployment was 29.3% in August 2023.</p>
               <p id="BA.IS.85">
        Economic reform in Bosnia and Herzegovina has been hampered by a lack of co-ordination between different levels of government, and the failure of the governing political factions to approve associated legislation, which caused both IMF and 
        <xr pageref="Y" ref="WB02047.IO.TXT">European Union (EU)</xr>
         funding to be withheld. An EU initiative to secure a commitment to the resumption of political reforms resulted in the adoption of a joint declaration at state level in early 2015. A Stabilization and Association Agreement (signed in 2008) consequently entered into force in June 2015, and the Government adopted a comprehensive reform agenda. In February 2016 the IMF approved a three-year credit arrangement under an Extended Fund Facility totalling €553.3m. In August 2018, however, the IMF indefinitely postponed credit, due to the failure of the Bosnian authorities to fulfil reform commitments. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, the EU allocated €73.5m. in assistance to mitigate its economic impact domestically, while the IMF approved emergency financing of €333m. under its Rapid Financing Instrument; however, continued political dissent impeded efforts to reach consensus on the reforms required to secure a new IMF credit facility. The country’s GDP contracted by 3.0% in 2020, but growth resumed at a rate of 7.4% in 2021. However, the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 led to a crisis in food and energy prices in Europe, and GDP growth slowed to 3.9% in that year, while the annual rate of inflation reached 14.0%. Meanwhile, following a recommendation by the European Commission, on 15 December the European Council granted Bosnia and Herzegovina official EU candidate status, contingent on the fulfilment of wide-ranging reforms. A report issued by the Commission in November 2023 acknowledged that the state-level Government had taken significant measures towards meeting requirements in a number of areas; however, a series of secessionist actions taken by the Republika Srpska Government (see 
        <i>Domestic Political Affairs</i>
        ) impeded overall progress. The IMF in September recommended the containment of public spending, particularly wage growth, and the implementation of structural and governance reforms. According to IMF figures, the rate of GDP growth declined to 2.0% in 2023, amid the ongoing impact of the war in Ukraine.
