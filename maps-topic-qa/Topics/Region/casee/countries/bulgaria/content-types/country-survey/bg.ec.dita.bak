               <!--https://www.bcci.bg/resources/files/BCCI-Bulgaria_in_figures-2023.pdf-->
      The Bulgarian economy is small and open. A currency board has operated successfully since 1997, one of the longest periods for a country under such a restrictive monetary regime, and has served as an effective tool for restoring and maintaining stability. The economy has withstood several strong external shocks, including the 2007-08 global financial crisis and recently the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. After the global financial crisis, from which the economy had recovered by 2011, Bulgaria’s gross domestic product (GDP) contracted by 4.0% during the height of the pandemic in 2020. Forecasts of the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Government for rapid economic recovery were downgraded several times, owing to the challenging external environment, but also to internal factors. After the economy was subjected to a uniquely testing environment, forced to perform under four different governments in the space of one year, two of them interim governments, it proved able to sustain progress despite political instability. The economy strongly recovered from the impact of the pandemic in 2021, when GDP growth rebounded at a rate of 7.6% in real terms. However, Bulgaria’s post-pandemic recovery was halted by the global effects of the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 and the ensuing Western economic sanctions imposed against Russia. Real GDP growth dropped to 3.4% in 2022, largely generated by private consumption and exports. The World Bank projected that real GDP growth would slow further to 1.5% in 2023, amid a downturn in the eurozone. Bulgaria’s Ministry of Finance in April forecast real growth of only 1.8% for that year, owing to a deterioration in external demand and financing conditions, and rising interest rates, with some improvement to growth of 3.3% expected to follow in 2024.
    </p>
          <p>The worsening of the international economic environment in 2020 strongly affected Bulgaria’s foreign trade. Exports of goods and services deteriorated from recording growth of 3.9% in 2019 to registering a decline of 11.3% in 2020. The pre-pandemic tendency towards a decreasing role for net exports in GDP continued for a fourth consecutive year, revealing a loss of competitiveness in the economy. Surprisingly, however, in 2021 foreign trade accelerated and fully recovered after the external shock in the previous year. In nominal terms, exports increased by around 25% and imports by nearly 28%. Exports grew by almost 37% in 2022, reflecting both higher prices and volumes of exported commodities (particularly petroleum products and fertilizers), while imports rose by 41%. However, the growth rate of exports was expected to slow significantly in 2023, due to weakened external demand, as well as an EU ban on the Bulgarian oil refinery’s export of petroleum products processed from Russian crude oil.</p>
          <p>The currency board that fixes the exchange rate of the national currency to the euro strengthens Bulgaria’s high degree of financial and commercial integration in the EU. The Bulgarian economy strongly depends on the dynamics of the euro area. External factors play a major role in economic development, which is largely demonstrated by the dynamics of foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows. In the period before the 2007-08 financial crisis, FDI spurred economic growth to a large extent, while the reduction of these inflows after 2008 contributed significantly to the deceleration of growth. The unsustainability of FDI inflows can be broadly explained by their structure. Most FDI stock is concentrated in the non-tradable and low value-added sectors. In the past, the upward phases of the economic cycle and recovery have always been supported by large FDI inflows. In contrast, FDI inflows contracted from €2,974m. in 2020 to €1,600m. in 2021. Inflows rose to €2,379m. in 2022, with Austria (€466m.), Switzerland (€459m.) and Cyprus (€351m.) accounting for the largest shares.</p>
          <p>The structure of the economy has remained fairly stable. The real estate market is a strong driver of economic `boom and bust’ tendencies. Before the global crisis, the growth of house prices in Bulgaria accelerated, doubling over a period of two years. The index reached its peak in the third quarter of 2008, and then declined significantly. The decline persisted until 2016, when prices again began to increase. The increase in disposable incomes and low interest rates fuelled demand for real estate over the last two years. The house price index was positive throughout 2021. The Bulgarian National Bank (BNB—central bank) implemented measures to restrain loans to households in order to protect the economy from a real estate `bubble’, whereby prices are driven up rapidly.</p>

      Although the Bulgarian economy has been growing faster than the EU average, in 2022 it had the lowest level of real GDP per capita in the EU on an international purchasing-power parity basis, at 59% of the EU average (compared with 55% in 2020). Overall, the economy is largely diverse. While in the capital, Sofia, GDP per capita was slightly above the EU average, four other regions (the so-called Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics regions) are the least developed in the EU. The economic slowdown and inflationary pressures adversely affected poverty reduction, with the poverty rate (defined at US $6.85 a day) declining slowly, from 4.5% in 2020 to 3.6% in 2022 and 3.5% in 2023, according to the World Bank.

          <heading>Macroeconomic Stability</heading>
          <p>The macroeconomic framework in Bulgaria is shaped by the restrictions imposed by the currency board established in 1997. Despite the strong external and internal shocks on the economy, during the last two decades the national currency, the Bulgarian lev, has remained stable, without any deviation from the fixed rate of exchange with the euro (1.95583). After the global financial crisis, a long period of macroeconomic stability commenced. The main macroeconomic indicators, i.e. fixed exchange rate, inflation, public debt, fiscal position and current account, stood at levels better than the EU average. Despite the pandemic-related shocks, macroeconomic stability was preserved, but the signs of rising inflation were already present.</p>
          <p>In common with several EU member states, and particularly among the catching-up economies during the pre-crisis period, inflation in Bulgaria expanded rapidly, reaching 12.3% in 2007, but it stood at just 2.3% by 2008. Inflation decelerated in the post-crisis period and for three years deflation was recorded. In 2020 the inflation rate decelerated to 1.7%, compared with 2.5% in 2019, associated with a decline in fuel and energy prices. The reduced consumption of households and businesses also contributed to the downturn in inflation. The monetary policy of the European Central Bank (ECB) in regard to inflation has a strong impact on the Bulgarian economy, due to the currency board and the fixed rate of exchange with the euro.</p>
          <p>The average inflation rate in 2021 was 3.3%, while the year-on-year rate at the end of that year was 7.8%. Increases in the price of fuels and raw materials, as well as in the cost of labour, contributed to the sharply rising rate of inflation. The economic policy response to inflation was the adoption of generous compensation measures that further boosted internal demand and tended to have pro-inflationary effects. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 precipitated a global rise in energy and food prices, Bulgaria recorded one of the highest inflation rates among EU countries, with consumer price inflation averaging 15.3% over that year, and reaching a 24-year high of 18.7% year-on-year in November. Consumer price inflation progressively eased to a rate of 10.1% in May 2023, but continued to be substantially higher than the average for the eurozone at that time (6.1%).</p>
          <p>Since 2009, despite the instability of external demand, exports have increased steadily, resulting in a small surplus on the current account during the past few years. In 2020, however, due to a reduction in external demand, exports contracted and the current account surplus, equivalent to 1.8% of GDP in 2019, deteriorated to a zero balance. A current account deficit of 1.8% was recorded in 2021, amid the post-pandemic recovery, narrowing to 0.7% in 2022.</p>
          <p>
      Bulgaria’s fiscal position has remained quite stable over the entire period since the introduction of the currency board. Although different Governments ruled the country, they maintained a prudent fiscal policy, which is an important driver for macroeconomic stability. The general government balance has been in surplus for five of the last 12 years, and the 2019 surplus amounted to 2.1% of GDP. However, due to pandemic-related expenditure and the contraction in state budget revenues, the fiscal position deteriorated to register a deficit of 4.0% of GDP in 2020 (much less than the 6.9% average in the EU). Revenue as well as expenditure fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter, driven by the instability of the economy and pandemic-related measures and costs. Much expenditure was already fixed in 2019, with an increase in pensions, and in the salaries of workers in public administration and teachers. The State Budget Act was revised twice in order to accommodate the shrinking revenue and expanding expenditure (by around 2,000m. new leva). The practice of revising the state budget during the fiscal year continued in 2021, with high inflation rather than the pandemic providing grounds for the increase in fiscal expenditure, and the deficit expanded slightly in that year, reaching 4.1% of GDP. Fiscal consolidation efforts resulted in a reduction in the budget deficit to 2.8% of GDP in 2022. However, a budget for 2023 that was approved in April, following delays due to a series of pre-term legislative elections, projected a huge deficit, equivalent to 6.4% of GDP. The outgoing interim Government claimed that the high target was the result of previous `political decisions and legislative changes’, which were related to the introduction of tax relief and reduced tax rates with negative effects on budget revenue, an increase in the cost of pensions and other social expenditures, as well as unrealized investment programmes. The European Commission forecast a rise in the deficit to 4.8% of GDP in 2023, but noted several positive factors, including an expected reduction in the net budgetary cost of energy support measures. 
      <!--https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:wYlLzZ7XiOgJ:https://sofiaglobe.com/2023/06/15/bulgarian-mps-approve-bill-to-prolong-2022-budget-act-provisions/&cd=25&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=uk-->
      Following the establishment of a new Government on 6 June, Minister of Finance Asen Vasilev announced that it would abandon the 2023 budget drafted by the interim administration and instead adopt a new state budget with a significantly lower target deficit. The National Assembly in mid-June approved legislation extending the provisions of the 2022 budget, together with some further pension and other benefit increases, until the end of July.
    </p>
          <p>The public debt history of Bulgaria is remarkable. The economic reforms back in the early 1990s began with a public debt-to-GDP ratio of 123%, and during the transition period the debt was cut to the historic low level of 11.3% in 2007. By the end of 2019 it stood at 20.4%, amid strong revenue performance and capital underspending. The extensive government expenditure in 2020 led to a significant increase in the public debt-to-GDP ratio, from 20.2% in 2019 to 25.1% in 2021. General government debt fell to 22.9% of GDP in 2022, remaining one of the lowest ratios in the EU. However, expansionary fiscal policies were expected to result in further increases in public debt. After progressive reductions in gross external debt, it increased in 2020, reaching 63.3% of GDP, but decreased to 58.0% of GDP in 2021 and to 52.5% in 2022. Private sector borrowing, both internal and external, was not as excessive as that of the Government.</p>
          <p>Maintaining the currency board requires the maintenance of large and stable buffers against downside risks. Prior to the introduction of the currency board total reserves in terms of the monthly cost of imports were maintained at about 1-1.5 months, while during the past decade they have remained at around 5-8 months. The reserves-to-debt indicator stood at 8% in 1997 and at 87.2% in 2021. Low levels of public debt and large buffers provide ample room to allow automatic stabilizers to operate in the event of a negative shock. However, the uncertainties related to the spread of COVID-19 encouraged the Government to borrow extensively, leading to an increase in total reserves to the record level of 11.1 months of imports. In 2021 total reserves fell back to 8 months of imports, remaining at that level in 2022.</p>
          <p>Despite Bulgaria’s robust fiscal performance, there are risk factors associated with the low efficiency of public expenditure, the slow pace of public administration reforms and overspending in unreformed sectors such as health care. An upside risk is the increase in the fixed costs of the state budget, owing to the rise in salaries in publicly financed sectors, as well as in pensions.</p>
          <p>As a country with a huge level of out-migration, migrant remittances contribute to financial inflows into the economy. The remittances-to-GDP indicator reached its maximum level of 8.1% of GDP in 2003, dropping to 2.6% by 2010, according to the World Bank. The remittances level rose slightly to 3.7% of GDP in 2017, before declining steadily to 2.3% in 2022.</p>

          <heading>The Labour Market</heading>
          <p>In the absence of monetary and fiscal instruments to help in adjusting the economy to external and internal shocks, the labour market is the main tool to address the challenges. Having left employment during the economic downturn, the labour force does not immediately return to the labour market and does not return to the same sectors of employment. This is one of the lessons that the corporate sector learned from the global financial and economic crisis, which was then emphasized by the pandemic-related crisis.</p>
          <p>The lockdown measures significantly affected supply and demand on the labour market. According to the labour force survey, the unemployment rate slightly increased in 2020, to 5.1%, compared with 4.2% the previous year (amounting to about 25,800 more unemployed), and remained at 5.3% in 2021. This relatively small increase was due at least partly to the measures introduced by the Government to provide 60% of labour costs to businesses in order to protect employment in the most affected enterprises. The economic recovery then benefited the labour market very quickly. By 2022 the labour market had recovered to the pre-pandemic level, with a fall in the unemployment rate to 4.3%.</p>
          <p>Long-term unemployment is one of the main problems affecting the labour market, and there is persistent and high youth unemployment. The youth unemployment rate (referring to the 15-29 age group) was 8.9% in 2019, twice the rate of total unemployment, and the rate jumped to 13.8% in 2020. Young people started a rather slow return to the labour market and youth unemployment remains high.</p>
          <p>
      Recent labour demand surveys indicate large shortages of labour in all sectors, but most severely in industry. Labour market conditions of high demand push wages up and the labour costs of employers keep increasing. Wage rises in the last three years were broadly driven by the government policy of stimulating public administration wages, as well as the wages of sectors that depend on the state budget, a policy that started in 2019. The mismatch of remuneration between the public and private sector widened. 
      <!--https://seenews.com/news/bulgarias-hourly-labour-costs-lowest-in-eu-in-2021-eurostat-778856-->
      According to data from the EU’s Statistical Office (Eurostat), in 2021 Bulgaria recorded the highest growth in hourly labour costs in the EU outside the euro area, averaging 9.1% in that year (although the average hourly cost remained the lowest in the EU, at €7.0 per hour). The excessive growth in wage and labour costs stimulates inflation and undermines the competitiveness of the economy. In 2022 nominal wages continued to increase strongly, reflecting both labour shortages and pressures from high inflation. In that year the average monthly wage in Bulgaria amounted to €889, an increase in nominal terms of 14%. The average hourly labour cost was €8.2, compared with an EU average of €30.5.
    </p>
          <p>The structure of employment by sector has remained fairly stable since the crisis. Agriculture constituted only 6.4% of total employment in 2022, while the industrial sector engaged 30.0% and services 63.6%. The Bulgarian economy is gradually converging to the EU average in terms of employment structure. The differences are seen in the higher exposure to labour-intensive sectors in Bulgaria. The innovative industries are still underdeveloped, and prospects are not positive owing to the country’s low investment rates and limited FDI in the technological sectors. </p>
          <p>The prospects for labour supply look unfavourable within the current economic structure. The ageing labour force is one of the main challenges that the economy faces. Those aged 45-64 constitute 48% of total employment, while the shares for the 15-24 and 25-34 age groups have declined.</p>
          <p>Over the last decade labour-intensive sectors advanced rather rapidly, consuming the largest part of the labour force. Considering the worsening labour market situation resulting from the demographic crisis, ageing and migration, it seems that labour market tools have almost exhausted their capacity as the main instrument for economic adjustment.</p>

          <heading>The Financial Sector</heading>
          <p>In 2021 the financial sector operated in a totally different environment in comparison with that of 2020. The sector successfully passed the test for stability in challenging conditions involving a combination of extreme factors. The economic recovery was accompanied by unprecedented external and internal political and economic instability. Regulatory changes, and most importantly the participation of the banking system in the EU’s Single Supervisory Mechanism (which grants the ECB direct control over some areas of banking supervision within the country) from October 2020, played a major role in the conduct of banking businesses. New regulatory requirements as part of the Basel III framework intended to guarantee banking soundness took place from June 2021. The systemic buffers assigned by the BNB also play a role in the capital indicators of the banking system.</p>
          <p>The financial sector has continued to expand, despite the impact of the global financial crisis, and recently the COVID-19 pandemic. The financial system remains traditional in nature, dominated by the banking sector and relying mainly on deposits. At the end of 2022 25 banks operated in Bulgaria, including seven branches of foreign banks. The BNB has not licensed any new banks for a long time. As part of continuing consolidation in the banking system, together with extensive mergers, in 2021 Belgium’s KBC acquired Raiffeisenbank Bulgaria from the Austrian-based Raiffeisen Bank International.</p>
          <p>From March 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the banking system faced a new source of risk. Although the system entered this period of unprecedented economic turmoil in relatively good shape, the threat to its stability increased. However, despite the pandemic shock on the sector, total banking assets increased by 8.6% and reached 104.1% of GDP in 2020. The banking system then fully recovered in 2021, when total assets grew by 9.2%. Total banking assets increased by a further 14.8% in 2022, when they amounted to 155,400m. new leva (€79,500m.).</p>
          <p>The banking system is almost entirely funded by deposits. To a large extent, the pandemic lockdown and associated uncertainties encouraged savings, which expanded by 11.9% to a record amount of 105,400m. new leva. Despite the low interest on deposits, they continued to grow in 2021, albeit at a slower pace compared with 2020, and reached 78% of GDP. The increase in deposits was a result of both new savings for precautionary purposes and the high propensity to save by the households that hold about two-thirds of deposits in the banking system.</p>
          <p>
      Despite the challenging environment, bank capital increased by 6.6% and contributed 14% of the financial resources of the banking system in 2020. 
      <!--https://abanksb.bg/en/banking-system/the-banking-system-in-bulgaria-in-2022-facts-and-figures/-->
      At the end of 2022 the total capital adequacy in the Bulgarian banking system was 20.1%. The liquidity coverage ratio at the end of 2022 was 235.0% (compared with 274.1% at the end of 2021), much higher than the average for the banks included in the Single Supervisory Mechanism (162.0% at September 2022, according to the ECB).
    </p>
          <p>Over the last few years banks have focused their credit activity on the retail sector, where high wage growth accompanied by low interest rates stimulated high credit demand. The expansion of retail credit was a logical reaction to the regulatory tightening of credit risk requirements, including the implementation of International Financial Reporting Standard 9 (IFRS 9). The BNB maintains a negative interest rate on excess reserves, but the effect on the real economy remains weak. The main factors that determined the performance of the banking sector in 2020 were weak economic activity and a decline in domestic consumption. After demand for credit recovered in 2021, high growth in home loans created some risks for the stability of banks.</p>
          <p>Against the background of the gradual recovery of the Bulgarian economy from the COVID-19 pandemic, growth in lending has increased, while the volume and share of non-performing loans (NPLs) has continued to decline. The volume of NPLs decreased to around 2,700m. new leva (€1,400m.), or 3.2% as a share of total gross loans, at the end of 2022.</p>
          <p>Although the level of NPLs is above the EU average, the banking system in Bulgaria is characterized by a much higher degree of impairment coverage for gross NPLs than the average level for EU countries. At the end of 2022 the coverage ratio of gross NPLs in the Bulgarian banking system was 77.6%, compared with the average for EU banks of 42.8%.</p>
     </gen-section>
     <gen-section print-style="COLUMN" sllink="SLSDOC" slsdocrf="GEN-SECTREF">
          <heading>Profitability</heading>
          <p>Following decreasing profitability, return on assets and return on equity in 2019, the following year was even worse for the banking system. Profitability ratios deteriorated in 2020, and net profit shrank by 51.4%. Regulatory factors, i.e. loss provisioning and impairment requirements, and measures to reduce the NPLs, played an important role. In 2020 total impairments in the system almost doubled to 879m. new leva compared with 2019. The implementation of IFRS 9 required banks to build their own models for forecasting potential further credit losses due to the consequences of the pandemic, and to accrue provisions in advance before the real losses materialized.</p>
          <p>Risk appetite was weak during pandemic period, due to the economic uncertainty and increased impairment requirements. The rise in liquidity due to the higher savings, together with reduced demand for credit, substantially reduced the profitability of banks in 2020, but it recovered rapidly. The net interest income of banks increased by 4.1% on an annual basis in 2021, and then by 17% in 2022, to 3,200m. new leva (€1,650m.) at the end of that year, amid higher lending activity. Net profit in the banking system reached 2,079m. new leva (€1,063m.) at the end of 2022, compared with 1,416m. new leva (€724m.) one year earlier. The other profitability ratios also improved. The return on assets ratio rose to 1.4% at the end of 2022, from 1.1% at the end of 2021. The return on equity ratio reached 12.3% at the end of 2022, compared with 8.9% at the end of 2021. Total impairments in the system fell to 594.2m. new leva by the end of 2021 and, further, to 585.7m. new leva at the end of 2022.</p>
          <p>During 2005-08 the Bulgarian Stock Exchange (BSE) developed rapidly, but the crisis damaged the sector in such a way that it was unable to recover for more than a decade. In 2021 a revival of the capital market started, driven by the new Bulgarian Enterprise Accelerator Market (BEAM), which was designed to promote the development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Transactions on the BSE increased by 42% compared with 2020, while turnover doubled. For the first time since 2007, there were seven initial public offerings in 2021. The net profit of the stock exchange increased substantially, further assisted by the dynamics of the Independent Bulgarian Energy Exchange, which has been acquired by the BSE. The BEAM market enjoyed very high interest among the fast growing small companies. From the beginning of 2021 the securities of global companies (more than 200 financial instruments) have been traded on the BSE, increasing its attractiveness for Bulgarian investors and stimulating this alternative option for investment.</p>
          <p>Amid challenges in the economic and regulatory environment, the banking sector continues to be stable and profitable, with high levels of capital adequacy and liquidity. The main trends for the banking sector are the accelerated processes of digital transformation, cyber security and management of processes and procedures aimed at the transition to, and achievement of, a green and sustainable economy.</p>
          <p>
      The non-banking financial sector has expanded in recent years. 
      <!--https://fintechbulgaria.org/annual-fintech-report-2022/-->
      The number of financial technology (fintech) companies in Bulgaria increased sharply to 156 in 2022, with personnel totalling 11,862 in 2021, while the total revenues of the industry reached about 1,800m. new leva in 2021. During 2017-21 investments in fintech companies rose from 1.3m. new leva to almost 11m. new leva, and in 2021 the industry accounted for around one-fifth of all venture capital investments in Bulgaria.
    </p>
          <p>The deterioration of the external environment and macroeconomic instability (particularly following the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022), together with the change in the interest rate cycle, created new risks for the financial sector. </p>

     <gen-section print-style="COLUMN" sllink="SLSDOC" slsdocrf="GEN-SECTREF">
          <heading>Progress towards the Euro</heading>
          <p>Bulgaria’s progress towards admission to the euro area has been unique. The country has been eager to adopt the euro, particularly owing to its monetary regime, with the strict currency board that has operated successfully since 1997, and has served as an anchor for the exchange rate and for macroeconomic stability. After the adoption of the euro by the three Baltic countries with similar monetary regimes, Bulgaria is currently the only country in the EU with such monetary arrangements. Being deprived of monetary policy instruments, and therefore having limited scope for fiscal policy, leaves no room for the flexibility that would allow it to adjust the economy to external and internal shocks. Euro adoption is the only way out from the currency board. Being fixed to the euro and integrated to a high degree with the economy of the euro area, Bulgaria’s financial and economic stability is strongly affected by ECB monetary policy.</p>
          <p>Since the beginning of the negotiations on EU accession, within the chapter on Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), the Bulgarian position has been that the nature of the currency board deserves recognition for its compatibility with ERM-II. Moreover, ERM-II allows currencies to fluctuate by +/-15%, while the currency board requires a fixed rate of exchange and no fluctuation. Nevertheless, the European Commission did not immediately accept Bulgaria’s position, and after the country’s accession to the EU in 2007 the ECB repeatedly declined applications by the Bulgarian authorities for participation in ERM-II. Finally, in July 2020 Bulgaria was admitted to ERM-II. In 2018 the ECB, the Eurogroup of euro area ministers of finance and the European Commission introduced a radical change with regard to ERM-II entry. At the time of admission to ERM-II, the country was required to participate in so-called close co-operation in the Banking Union, which is established between the ECB and the national competent authorities of participating member states that do not use the euro as their national currency. The national authorities lose some control over the supervision and stability of their systemic banks.</p>
          <p>
      The monetary and financial developments in 2021 indicated that, despite the challenging external environment in 2020 and 2021, the performance of the national currency and the economy in ERM-II had been smooth, without risks to stability. However, the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and issues within the euro area itself generated some public scepticism about early adoption of the euro. Adoption of the euro by the target date of 1 January 2024 remained one of the Government’s priorities, but the fulfilment of inflation criteria and the achievement of fiscal sustainability both presented challenges. On 1 June 2022 the ECB and the European Commission published convergence reports assessing the fulfilment of the criteria by member states: it was considered that Bulgaria had not met all the conditions for adoption of the euro, as its legislation was not yet fully compatible, and it had not satisfied the criteria on price stability. Amid domestic political uncertainty and inflationary pressures in the EU, in February 2023 the interim Government announced a revised target for adoption of the euro by 2025. At mid-2023 the continued high inflation rate and absence of a budget with a target deficit that met EU criteria (see 
      <i>Macroeconomic Stability</i>
      ) constituted obstacles to the accession of Bulgaria to the eurozone.

          <p>Meanwhile, Bulgaria’s National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP), which was to be financed by €6,270m. in EU grants over five years, was endorsed by the European Commission in April 2022; it included significant provisions to accelerate the decarbonization of the energy sector and increase power generation from renewable energy sources (with a target to end coal-fuelled electricity generation by 2040). In December 2022 the European Commission disbursed the first tranche of funds under the NRRP, comprising grants of €1,370m.</p>

          <heading>Continuing Vulnerabilities</heading>
          <p>The main weaknesses of the Bulgarian economy relate to the country’s weak institutions and rule of law, as well as the unfavourable investment climate. In 2020 Bulgaria ranked 61st out of 190 countries, with a score of 72, according to the World Bank’s `ease of doing business’ indicators. Bulgaria scored only 43 points out of 100 on the 2022 Corruption Perceptions Index of Transparency International and ranked 72nd worldwide (with the second highest level of corruption among EU member states). According to a study conducted at the request of a European Parliament committee in early 2023, Bulgaria’s `grey’ economy was the largest in Europe, equivalent to an estimated 33.1% of official GDP.</p>
          <p>The COVID-19 crisis revealed the large deficiencies of structural reforms and presented new challenges for the post-pandemic recovery of the economy. Further difficulties and opportunities are posed by the fulfilment of EU’s environmental pledges. The improvement of transport infrastructure coverage and quality also needs further investment. The state-owned railway company has continued to accumulate huge debts, despite receiving constant state aid.</p>
          <p>The vulnerabilities of the Bulgarian economy are in essence its structural characteristics. The postponement of structural reforms accumulates risks to long-term growth and stability. Those weaknesses limit the potential of Bulgaria to achieve the average GDP per capita for the EU. Addressing those challenges requires much more than simply increasing public expenditure. The European Commission, as well as the ECB, the IMF and the credit rating agencies, point to the structural weaknesses of Bulgaria’s economy, which require strong decisions that may not be welcomed by large parts of the population.</p>
          <p>Owing to its high energy dependence on Russia, Bulgaria was severely affected by the Western sanctions imposed following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Russian state enterprise Gazprom (which had previously provided over 90% of the gas used in Bulgaria) in late April suspended gas supplies to Bulgaria, after the country rejected a demand for payment in Russian roubles. A new Gas Interconnector Greece-Bulgaria pipeline, which became operational at the beginning of October, was initially to provide around 1,000m. cu&#160;m of gas from Azerbaijan to Bulgaria annually; by that time Azerbaijan was supplying around one-third of Bulgaria’s gas. As part of further diversification efforts, in January 2023 a 13-year agreement allowing the transit of gas to Bulgaria via Türkiye was concluded by Bulgarian state gas company Bulgargaz and the Turkish state energy operator. However, in June 2022 Bulgaria was granted an exemption from an EU ban on the import of Russian seaborne crude oil and petroleum products, allowing it to continue to import Russian oil for domestic use until the end of 2024.</p>
          <p>After five parliamentary elections in Bulgaria over the two years from April 2021, a new coalition Government was formed in early June 2023. Its main priorities were the preparation of a new budget for 2023, the completion of judicial reforms and the implementation of commitments under the NRRP. Due to the prolonged political instability, however, delays in the adoption of the targets and measures required for Bulgaria to receive funds under the NRRP had resulted in delays to the release of further tranches, which represented substantial investment resources.</p>
