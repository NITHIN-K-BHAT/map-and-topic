     <p>Often referred to in the media as the poorest and most corrupt country in the European Union (EU), Bulgaria nevertheless has made remarkable progress since breaking with its communist past. Today, Bulgaria is fully integrated into the Euro-Atlantic structures and is aiming to join both the eurozone and the EU’s Schengen area of free movement. Recent crises, however, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine following the Russian Federation’s invasion of February 2022, have had a severe impact on the country, both politically and economically. Bulgarian politics have been eventful, and unique in many ways. Bulgaria has been the country with one of the longest-serving communist heads of state in Eastern Europe (1954-89) and the only democracy in the world to have a former monarch elected as Prime Minister. Bulgaria is also notable for holding five parliamentary elections during the two years from April 2021 and having no stable government over that period. Like many European countries, Bulgaria has had to contend with the rise of populism and nationalism, in addition to its continued struggle against corruption, and, as a result of the war in Ukraine, with a population divided in attitudes towards Russia. This essay reviews the principal developments in Bulgarian politics, with an emphasis on the country’s recent democratic history.</p>

          <heading>Historical Background</heading>
          <p>
      The Bulgarian state was established in 681
      <sc> ce</sc>
      , following a coalition between Proto-Bulgarian and Slavic tribes. By the ninth century the two tribes were further united, though not without resistance, by a common religion (Christian Orthodoxy) and alphabet (the Cyrillic alphabet). This early stage of the Bulgarian state was dominated by a series of conflicts with the Byzantine Empire. The conquest by the OsmanlI (Ottoman) Empire of part of Europe resulted in five centuries of Ottoman rule over the Bulgarian lands, during which time the Bulgarian state seized to exist. A national revival led to a series of uprisings in the late 19th century, culminating with the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78. The post-war San Stefano treaty envisioned a large, new independent Bulgarian state, which, however, proved unacceptable to the Great Powers of Europe, notably the United Kingdom and Austria-Hungary. The Congress of Berlin of 1878 redrew the map of Bulgaria, dividing it into the autonomous Principality of Bulgaria, and Eastern Rumelia within the Ottoman Empire. The subsequent seven decades were defined by various attempts on the part of Bulgarian rulers and governments to secure the return of the territories to which Bulgaria believed it was entitled. A Russian provisional administration aided Bulgaria in establishing state structures and institutions, and a German prince and nephew of the Russian Tsar, Aleksandar von Battenburg, of the House of Hesse-Darmstadt, was invited to become the monarch of the newly independent state. Prince Aleksandar managed to unite the Kingdom of Bulgaria with Eastern Rumelia, before being forced to abdicate the throne in 1887. He was replaced as Prince of Bulgaria by Ferdinand of the House of Saxe-Coburg (Sakskoburg), whose dynasty, including his son, Boris III, and grandson, Simeon II, was to rule Bulgaria until the communist takeover in 1944. Bulgaria participated in all the wars of the first half of the 20th century that took place in the region—the Balkan Wars, the First World War and the Second World War—with the main objective of regaining its territories. Bulgaria allied with Germany in both World Wars, which placed it on the losing side, failing to keep any territories that it might have temporarily regained. Following independence, Bulgaria had mixed experiences with democracy that included frequent changes of government, military coups and sporadic bans on party functioning, as well as communist and Macedonian militant activity. Some present-day parties trace their origins to those early days, including the socialist, agrarian and Macedonian parties. The invasion of the Soviet army in September 1944 aided a coalition of leftist parties, dominated by the Balgarska Komunisticheska Partiya (BKP—Bulgarian Communist Party), to seize power in yet another coup. This coup, however, was to put an end to the frail democracy and institute a lasting Soviet-style regime in the country.

          <heading>Communist Rule (1944-89)</heading>
          <p>Among the countries of Eastern Europe, Bulgaria was known as the most trusted Soviet ally and the country that most closely replicated the Soviet model of one-party rule, fusion of party and state, a centrally planned economy, nationalization of property, collectivization of agriculture, control over cultural and social life, and repression. Bulgaria was also the country with the longest-serving communist leader, Todor Zhivkov, who held power for 35 years until the end of communist rule. Although the regime shed some of its totalitarian characteristics after the death of Soviet leader Stalin (Iosif Dzhugashvili) in 1953, Bulgaria had a very weak, belated and poorly organized dissident movement that did not pose a serious challenge.</p>
          <p>Following the September 1944 coup carried out by the BKP-dominated Otechestven Front (Fatherland Front), the BKP rapidly implemented decisive measures to eliminate its political rivals and to consolidate power. Seizing control of the interior and justice ministries allowed it to pursue and prosecute any `unfriendly elements’. People’s Courts and workers’ councils were created, with the intention of instilling fear among the population and forestalling any opposition. During the few months of their existence, People’s Courts tried 11,122 individuals, sentencing 2,618 of them to death, of whom 1,046 were executed. By contrast, between 1923 and 1944, the period labelled as `the fascist regime’ by the communists, the courts had pronounced 1,590 death sentences on political prisoners, of which 199 had been carried out. The new regime physically eliminated the previous political elite, executing the regency that had ruled on behalf of the child Tsar Simeon II, all members of the previous Government, 67 deputies of the last parliament, and 47 generals. The army and the Bulgarian Orthodox Church were further neutralized through show trials of priests and generals, the dismissal of army officers and a new law on religion. The communists then turned their attention to their political allies within the Otechestven Front, engineering a split between the Agrarians and the Social-Democrats, and executing the popular leader of the Balgarski Zemedelski Naroden Sayuz (Bulgarian Agrarian People’s Union), Nikola Petkov, following a prominent show trial. A referendum in 1946 brought an end to the monarchy, sending the Tsar and his family into exile, and a new Constitution adopted in December 1947 proclaimed Bulgaria a People’s Republic.</p>
          <p>Extensive purges were also carried out within the BKP, aiming to erode support for the domestic communists, led by Traicho Kostov, while solidifying the power of Georgi Dimitrov. A favourite of the Soviet authorities, Dimitrov had distinguished himself with his leadership of the Communist International organization (1919-43) and spent the period of the Second World War in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), returning to become Prime Minister in 1946. The execution of Kostov, after he was sentenced at a show trial in 1949 on charges of planning to overthrow the Government, allowed the ascendancy of Valko Chervenkov, Dimitrov’s son-in-law, also known as Bulgaria’s `little Stalin’. Chervenkov established a true totalitarian regime, installing the final elements of a Soviet-type system. The first five-year plan was adopted in 1949 and the full collectivization of land was completed by 1957. Bulgaria joined the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA, or Comecon), founded between the USSR and many of the newly established communist states of Eastern Europe, in 1949, and the Warsaw Pact in 1955, aligning its trade with the USSR and `sovietizing’ its army. Marxism-Leninism became the official state ideology and the foundation of cultural and educational policy. The Otechestven Front was reduced to a mass organization in charge of exercising social control.</p>
          <p>Stalin’s death in 1953 shook communist regimes across Eastern Europe, which needed to respond to the course adopted by the new Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, whereby personality cult was replaced by collective leadership together with greater social and cultural freedom—a period known as the `thaw’. Chervenkov reluctantly followed the new Soviet model. He put an end to brutal repression, rehabilitated political prisoners and reinstated those who had been purged, encouraged the proliferation of consumer goods, and introduced liberalization in art and culture. Most importantly, Chervenkov relinquished leadership of the party to Todor Zhivkov, considered to be politically unexceptional. Chervenkov, largely misjudging Zhivkov, had hoped for a figurehead who would strictly follow orders. Instead, within a few years, Zhivkov managed to seize complete power and to establish flexible and effective mechanisms for maintaining such power. Yet, Zhivkov refrained from imposing a personality cult and reinstating a totalitarian regime. Shrewdly, Zhivkov adopted a policy of relaxing party control, avoiding repression and harshness and the `soft’ elimination of political rivalries, with the frequent reshuffling of party members, and maintained good relations with the Soviet authorities. Such a strategy gained him popularity both with the Soviet leadership and domestically, where he was praised for being `a man of the people’.</p>
          <p>The Zhivkov era was characterized by economic experiments. In an attempt to stimulate economic growth, Zhivkov adopted a series of policies known as the `Zhivkov thesis’, which envisioned self-management of the agricultural collectives and a new economic plan that emphasized decentralization and applied science and technology. Despite the failure of those policies, by the 1970s Bulgaria had made significant progress in industrialization, urbanization, education, health care, and consumer goods. This, combined with widespread pro-Russian sentiment among the population and the absence of Soviet troops in the country, rendered the regime increasingly legitimate compared with those of many other Eastern European countries. Such positive aspects notwithstanding, Zhivkov also increased the activities of the secret service police, which were transferred under his direct control, requested that Bulgaria be accepted as the 16th Soviet republic both in 1960 and 1973, and adopted a Constitution notable for its first article referring to `the leading role of the Party’.</p>
          <p>The rise to power of Mikhail Gorbachev in the USSR in 1985 marked the beginning of the fall of communist rule across Eastern Europe. Determined to put an end to economic stagnation and political corruption, and to oust hardliners within the party, Gorbachev embarked on radical policies of liberalization known as glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring). The reformist changes proved disastrous for Zhivkov, who was disliked by Gorbachev and who had no intention of implementing liberal reforms. For the first time, Zhivkov fell out of favour with the Soviet authorities, while opposition outside and within the party was mounting. The Soviet reforms allowed for open criticism of the regime and of Zhivkov himself, raising issues of widespread corruption, economic stagnation, environmental degradation, ideological hollowness and cynicism. In an attempt to suppress the increasing challenges to his power, Zhivkov launched a large-scale campaign of ethnic assimilation targeted against the Turkish minority. The so-called `renaming process’ resulted in the forced renaming of over 800,000 ethnic Turks and the exile of 350,000 to Turkey (now known as Türkiye). The campaign caused riots among the ethnic Turks and an international outcry, which prompted a special United Nations (UN) Security Council session on the issue. Meanwhile, dissident activity was on the rise. Thus far characterized by individual acts of dissent, opponents of the regime began to form the first dissident organizations. Such organizations allied over several issues—glasnost and perestroika, political repression and human rights, and environmental damage. Compared with other Eastern European countries, the dissidence in Bulgaria was belated and poorly organized. In fact, organized dissidence did not emerge until 1988, when it comprised around 200 individuals with overlapping membership of the various associations. Moreover, the Bulgarian dissident movement lacked a clear vision and consensus. Although some members advocated the abolition of communist rule altogether, others favoured its reform. Nevertheless, Bulgarian dissidents contributed to the fall of the regime and laid the foundation of the political opposition that was to negotiate the transition to democracy with the BKP.</p>

          <heading>The Post-Communist Transition—the `Lost Years’</heading>
          <p>Bulgaria was one of two countries (the other being Romania) where the former communist party, renamed the Balgarska Sotsialisticheska Partiya (BSP—Bulgarian Socialist Party), won the first democratic elections, and the only country to begin the transition with a Constitutional Assembly that was given the task of drafting a new constitution. This process distracted from more immediate concerns and was dominated by the former communists, who held a majority in the first democratically elected parliament, the Narodno Sobranie (National Assembly). Such circumstances placed Bulgaria far behind other Eastern European countries and posed great obstacles to establishing democratic rule and a market economy.</p>
          <p>The fall of the communist regime in Bulgaria was not the result of a revolution, but rather a pre-emptive action and reform from above. On 10 November 1989, a day after the fall of the Berlin Wall (the barrier separating communist East Germany from West Germany), Zhivkov formally resigned at a BKP plenum, as a result of pressure from senior party figures in co-ordination with the Soviet authorities. Following the emergence of a pro-reformist wing within the BKP, Andrei Lukanov became premier of a new Government in February 1990, and Aleksandar Lilov became leader of the party (which was shortly after renamed the BSP); Petar Mladenov was elected to the new post of President of the country by the National Assembly on 3 April. This allowed the party to retain legitimacy and portray itself as the initiator of reform. Although the change in leadership was imposed from above, it gave a signal to dissident organizations and the population at large, precipitating a series of demonstrations. By early December dissident organizations had allied to form the Sayuz na Demokratichnite Sili (SDS—Union of Democratic Forces), which was to become the main opposition force in the subsequent decade. An eclectic and loosely organized coalition, the SDS was united by little more than its common anti-communist stance. It lacked resources and expertise, a common vision, and a stable organizational structure. Its support was primarily concentrated in large cities, whereas the rest of the country was dominated by the former communists. Following the model in Poland (where radical political reforms were adopted), the BKP and the SDS agreed on `round table’ negotiations that set the terms of a forthcoming transition and prepared for the first democratic elections. Accusations of electoral irregularities notwithstanding, the BSP secured victory at the legislative elections in June. Despite failing to form a stable government in the following two years, the former communists dominated the Constitutional Assembly and hence came to shape the new Constitution. The absence to this day of effective lustration policies further solidified the position of the former ruling elite and the BSP. Lack of open access to the secret service files further fuelled numerous conspiracy theories as to the involvement of the former secret service in the transition and allowed for damaging allegations, particularly around election periods.</p>
          <p>Politics in the 1990s were characterized by a power struggle between the BSP and the SDS, with outcomes often being determined by a third party, the Dvizhenie za Prava i Svobodi (DPS—Movement for Rights and Freedoms), representing principally ethnic Turks, which would strategically ally with one side or the other. This `regularized’ exchange of power was accompanied by unprecedented economic decline and great political instability that resulted in nine governments in the first seven years of the transition, also called the `lost years’. Lukanov’s first two Governments proved short-lived and were followed by a technocratic administration, led by Dimitar Popov, with a limited mandate to organize elections. The October 1991 elections were narrowly won by the SDS, resulting in the formation of a coalition Government between the SDS and the DPS. Lasting a little over a year, the SDS-dominated Government, led by Filip Dimitrov, lost support both from the DPS and its own parliamentary deputies, and collapsed following a failed confidence vote (which had been initiated by Dimitrov himself in an attempt to secure parliamentary support for reform policies). A new Government of largely technocratic ministers, headed by Lyuben Berov, was formed in December 1992 with the support of the DPS. The Berov administration became a symbol of poor governance and schemes involving former members of the communist elite. Berov finally resigned in September 1994, after which a provisional Government, headed by Reneta Indzhova, was entrusted with organizing elections. Legislative elections in December returned the BSP to power. The ensuing socialist Government, under the premiership of BSP leader Zhan Videnov, failed to meet the expectations of the electorate. A reversion to socialist-era practices in trade and the economy proved disastrous, culminating in a banking and financial crisis in 1996 that was accompanied by inflation rates of over 300%. In early 1997 Videnov resigned and another provisional Government was appointed, headed by Stefan Sofianski, the SDS Mayor of the capital Sofia. Immediately instituting a currency board, Sofianski took measures to control inflation and organized new elections. A SDS-led coalition secured victory in April, after which Ivan Kostov of the SDS became leader of the first post-communist Government to complete its four-year mandate. Kostov took decisive measures to reorientate the country towards the Euro-Atlantic structures and set it on course for membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the EU. He introduced a comprehensive stabilization programme, accelerating privatization, and introducing banking and tax reforms, as well as a number of other macroeconomic measures. Despite such unquestionable achievements, the Kostov Government was unable to refute accusations against it of corruption, and was blamed for not bringing to justice those responsible for the 1996 crisis.</p>
          <p>This political exchange of power between the BSP and the SDS during the 1990s is regarded as the bipolar political model by Bulgarian commentators. The model was based on the main divide within society at the time—that between former communists and anti-communists. Traditional labels of `left’ and `right’ had little applicability in the Bulgarian context, where the left came to be dominated by the BKP, hence symbolizing the status quo and the old regime. The right, in turn, was the only available ideological space for party competition, which was occupied by the SDS and many small, short-lived parties and coalitions. The ideological incongruence and fragmentation of the right, coupled with the domination of the left by the former communists, would eventually lead to a complete disintegration of the right in the following decade, with numerous internal splits, regroupings and formation of new right-wing movements. Aside from the BSP, which relied on its communist-era structures, parties were of the elite type, having little grounding in society—they hardly represented voters’ preferences and did not enjoy large membership. Party organizations were weak, with no stable internal procedures either for recruitment or nomination of candidates. Given the political instability, government policy in that period changed direction with every new administration and alternated between the decommunization agenda and shock therapy of the SDS, and the BSP’s gradualist approach and `forgive and forget’ rhetoric. The result was stalled economic reform, declining living standards, low trust and mass disillusionment with political parties, particularly the BSP and the SDS.</p>

          <heading>Bulgaria in NATO and the EU</heading>
          <p>After a decade of political instability and economic hardship, Bulgarians were suffering from transition fatigue and impatient with the democratic process, and were seeking a saviour. It was at this time that the former Tsar Simeon II (Simeon Sakskoburggotski) made a dramatic reappearance. Exiled by the communist regime in 1946 at the age of nine, Sakskoburggotski finally settled in Spain, becoming the symbol of the lost monarchy and Bulgaria’s brief pre-communist experience with democracy. He returned to Bulgaria and formed a new political organization in his name, the Natsionalno Dvizhenie Simeon Vtori (NDSV—National Movement Simeon II), just months before the 2001 parliamentary elections. The NDSV secured an unexpected victory in those elections, with 43% of the votes cast, and proceeded to lead a coalition Government with the DPS. Sakskoburggotski’s return to Bulgarian politics abruptly ended the bipolar political model, taking votes from the SDS, which would almost certainly have won the elections, and also gaining support from BSP voters. The NDSV was centred around its leader, with loose structures based on circles of associates, proclaiming itself to be not a party, but a `coalition of like-minded individuals’. Capitalizing on disillusionment with the transition and established elites, the NDSV relied on a vague platform and ambitious promises such as `fixing the country in 800 days’. This new formula marked the birth of populism in post-communist Bulgarian politics and legitimized the personalist party model which dominates politics to the present day.</p>
          <p>
      Unlike previous governments, Sakskoburggotski’s administration did not change policy direction, and continued the reforms initiated by Kostov. It was during the NDSV’s rule that Bulgaria was declared a functioning market economy, the EU accession plan was signed, and all 31 chapters of the 
      <i>acquis communautaire</i>
       (the EU body of law) were closed. Like Kostov before him, Sakskoburggotski supported NATO ground operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, and he presided over Bulgaria’s accession to NATO in 2004. None the less, Sakskoburggotski failed to deliver on the unrealistic promises made during the electoral campaign, which ultimately caused him to lose the premiership. Consequently, at the 2005 elections the NDSV received only a fraction of its previous electoral support, with 22% of the votes.
    </p>
          <p>The June 2005 legislative elections were won by the BSP, which obtained only around 31% of the votes cast, and was obliged to form a coalition Government. The new `triple coalition’ comprised the BSP, the NDSV and the DPS, and was headed by BSP leader Sergey Stanishev. The triple coalition appeared to make sense ideologically, since it consisted of a social-democratic party and two liberal parties. Past history and legacies, however, rendered this coalition unviable for voters. Being the successor party of the former communist party, the BSP was regarded as the party that had exiled the monarch in 1946 and carried out the renaming campaign against the ethnic Turks during the 1980s. Consequently, voters of all three parties felt betrayed and the coalition proved unable to shed its image of having been formed under a cartel agreement. Even though Bulgaria gained EU membership in 2007, during the time of the triple coalition, the Government was severely criticized by the European Commission for widespread corruption, organized crime, the embezzlement of EU funds and an inefficient judiciary. In July 2008 up to €1,000m. of EU funding allocated to Bulgaria was suspended over corruption scandals, with the result that a range of projects—from road-building to job creation—were halted. The record of the triple coalition was therefore mixed at best.</p>
          <p>Moreover, the 2005 elections resulted in the emergence of an extremist populist association, Partiya Ataka (Ataka—Attack Party). Formed just months beforehand and centred around its charismatic leader, Volen Siderov, Ataka adopted a rhetoric that was clearly nationalist, anti-elite, anti-Western and even anti-democratic. In combining neonationalist and neototalitarian elements, Ataka appealed to voters across the political spectrum, with its mix of nationalism, welfare chauvinism and nostalgia for the communist past. Obtaining over 8% of the votes cast in the 2005 elections, Ataka secured 21 parliamentary seats. Bulgarian nationalist parties subsequently maintained a firm presence in the National Assembly, and between 2017 and 2021 also in government. Ataka’s performance in the October 2006 presidential election proved even more disconcerting, as Siderov secured enough votes to proceed to a second round against the incumbent BSP President, Georgi Parvanov—however, the latter secured a convincing victory in the final vote. In Bulgaria’s first European Parliament elections in May 2007, Ataka received 14.2% of the votes cast, electing three candidates to the Parliament. Its support increased in the 2009 legislative elections from some 300,000 to around 400,000 votes, but resulted in only a marginal gain (to 9.4% of the total), owing to higher voter turnout. Ataka became the fourth-largest party in the country at the time and hence an important actor in parliamentary politics, particularly when voting on foreign policy issues and energy policy—both areas directly related to Bulgaria’s relations with Russia. The 2014 European Parliament and legislative elections proved disastrous for Ataka, but only owing to the emergence of another radical right-wing grouping, and a splinter party from Ataka, the Natsionalen Front za Spasenie na Bulgaria (NFSB—National Front for the Salvation of Bulgaria), which managed to attract a significant part of Ataka’s voter support. As a result, both nationalist formations failed to elect any candidates to the European Parliament. This experience served as an impetus for nationalist parties to unite for the 2017 parliamentary elections, thus securing representation in the National Assembly and becoming a junior coalition partner in government (see below).</p>
          <p>The 2009 elections brought another new party to the political arena, the Grazhdani za Evropeysko Razvitie na Balgariya (GERB—Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria), which subsequently became the most enduring and powerful political force in the country, holding power almost uninterruptedly between 2009 and 2021. GERB was formed in late 2006 by Boyko Borisov, while he was Mayor of Sofia. Shortly after its establishment, GERB gained the endorsement of the European People’s Party (EPP) in the first for Bulgaria European Parliament elections in 2007. and secured five of the 18 Parliament seats allocated to Bulgaria. By the time of the July 2009 Bulgarian legislative elections, GERB had established itself as a major political force and received around 40% of the votes. Failing to secure a parliamentary majority, GERB formed a minority Government. GERB reaffirmed its hold on power in the presidential and local elections of October 2011, winning over one-half of the mayoral seats in the country, while its representative, Rosen Plevneliev, secured 52.6% of the votes cast in the second round of the presidential poll. With Plevneliev as President, the largest representation in the National Assembly, and a Borisov-led Government, GERB controlled all the major organs of executive and legislative power.</p>
          <p>Replicating Sakskoburggotski’s formula, GERB at first lacked an established party structure and ideological coherence. GERB’s programme consisted of elusive and symbolic issues, such as `corruption’ and `crime’, which appealed to a discontented electorate, while its party officials represented a hastily and often apparently randomly selected group of experts and people from Borisov’s personal circle. Lacking recruitment criteria other than Borisov’s personal judgement, GERB (and Borisov) frequently changed ministers (with four health ministers appointed in less than three years during GERB’s first Government, two justice and two education ministers during its second administration, and nine ministers changed in its third cabinet). With time, GERB developed dense structures throughout the country, penetrating national, regional, and local government, and establishing a loyal electoral base. These structures have been crucial in securing GERB’s almost uninterrupted hold on power for over a decade and the party’s continued success in recent parliamentary elections.</p>
          <p>GERB’s rule did not remain unchallenged. In February 2013 GERB’s first Government collapsed, following violent mass protests prompted by disagreements over energy policy. Borisov resigned three months before the scheduled legislative elections, only for GERB to receive the largest share of the vote (30.6%) in the elections held in May. However, GERB was unable to muster enough support in the National Assembly to form a government, and yielded its mandate to the BSP. The BSP formed a coalition Government with the DPS, headed by Plamen Oresharski. The controversial and short-lived appointment by the DPS of Delyan Peevski, an elected deputy and media businessman accused of having connections with organized crime, as head of the State Agency for National Security, precipitated a series of protests, which continued for over 18 months. The protests fostered a new culture of civil society organization, with unprecedented citizen engagement and monitoring. Criticism by the European Commission of the country’s lack of progress in judicial reform and measures against corruption, as well as a pro-Russian energy policy, increased pressure on the Government, which resigned in July 2014 after less than 18 months in office. Further elections were scheduled for October.</p>
          <p>At the legislative elections, held on 5 October 2014, GERB secured 32.7% of the votes, far more than the second-placed party, the BSP, which received its lowest-ever share of the vote, of 15.4%. A fragmented National Assembly, with an unprecedented number of parties (eight), posed a great challenge to government formation. GERB was ultimately able to return to power and form a coalition Government with the Reformatorski Blok (Reformist Bloc—a grouping that united parties from the right, including the SDS and its breakaway movements), the Patryotychen Front (Patriotic Front—a coalition of the NFSB and the VMRO—Balgarsko Natsionalno Dvizhenie, VMRO—BND, IMRO—Bulgarian National Movement), and the Alternativa za Balgarsko Vazrazhdane (ABV—Alternative for Bulgarian Revival), established by former BSP leader and President (in 2001-09) Parvanov. The coalition thus encompassed elements ranging from the extreme right to the centre-left, and disagreements emerged over a number of issues, including pension and health reforms, energy policy, the budget, and a new electoral law, causing dissent between the coalition partners. With a presidential election approaching in late 2016, the ABV left the coalition and began to discuss a joint presidential nomination with the BSP. The two groupings failed to reach agreement on a common candidate, which did not, however, prevent the BSP from securing a convincing victory for its nominally independent candidate, pro-Russian former air force commander Rumen Radev, who attracted votes from across the political spectrum, including from supporters of nationalist parties, to take 59.4% of the ballot in the second round, held on 13 November. Securing re-election in November 2021 (see below), Radev became the first President to obtain a second term in office.</p>
          <p>Radev’s presidency has had a significant impact on political dynamics. A very popular President, who was the most vocal opponent of Borisov, Radev used his political leverage to expand presidential authority (within constitutional limits) and increase the political influence of the presidential office. Radev made frequent use of his veto power in order to challenge government decisions, resulting in increased tensions with Borisov, polarization of the political debate, and political confrontation. Radev’s criticism, and his ability to mobilize popular opinion, ultimately contributed to the ousting of Borisov in 2021. Since then, and due to the inability of successive parliaments to form a regular government, Radev was de facto in charge through a series of interim governments, which, as outlined in the Constitution, are appointed by the President in the absence of a popular or parliamentary vote.</p>
          <p>Borisov’s second resignation, on 14 November 2016, resulted in yet another pre-term general election, held on 26 March 2017—the third in just four years. GERB was again successful, attracting 33.5% of the votes and some 75,000 more individual votes, compared with the previous election. Borisov thus returned to the premiership. However, the most significant revival was achieved by the BSP, which almost doubled its share of the votes, to 27.9%, the second largest share of any party. The 2017 legislative elections proved a disappointment for the DPS, which registered significant losses in terms of both votes and seats in parliament. Support for the party fell to less than 10% of the votes, largely attributed to the splintering into two of the party’s support base following the ousting in December 2015 of its former chairman, Lyutvi Mestan, who subsequently formed his own party, known as DOST (Demokrati Otgovornost, Svoboda i Tolerantnost—Democrats for Responsibility, Freedom and Tolerance—a creative abbreviation, which means `friend’ in Turkish). The most striking defeat in the elections, however, was that of the traditional right wing, in all of its incarnations. The Reformatorski Blok was disproportionately well represented in the second Borisov Government (2014-16), receiving seven ministerial portfolios in return for the support of its 23 deputies. Disagreement within the coalition deepened even further once it entered the Government, making a split inevitable. Consequently, two new groupings emerged from within the Reformatorski Blok during January 2017—the `Yes, Bulgaria’ movement, under the leadership of former Minister of Justice Hristo Ivanov, and the New Republic alliance, headed by Radan Kanev, the leader of the Demokrati za Silna Bulgaria (Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria). As anticipated, none of the new groupings (which included a reworked alliance formed by the Reformatorski Blok) managed to pass the 4% electoral threshold.</p>
          <p>The largest and most significant development in the March 2017 elections was the entry of the nationalists into the Government. Following a split nationalist vote in the previous two elections, Volen Siderov’s Ataka and the Patryotychen Front agreed to join forces, together with VMRO—BND, as the Obedineni Patrioti (OP—United Patriots). The OP received 9.3% of the votes, thereby approximately maintaining the parties’ previous combined level of support, which was a considerable disappointment, given their much higher expectations. However, the configuration of seats in the new National Assembly made the OP the only viable coalition partner for GERB. Consequently, for the first time in Bulgaria’s post-communist history, the radical right was formally included in the government. The OP alliance received five portfolios in the Council of Ministers, and VMRO—BND and the NFSB were awarded deputy premierships. The participation of nationalist parties in the Bulgarian Government had serious policy implications. In early 2018 opposition from the nationalist parties prevented the parliamentary ratification of the Council of Europe’s Istanbul Convention relating to violence against women, principally due to controversy over the presence of the word `gender’ in the text. They advocated for the return of conscription military service and of welfare policies that excluded minorities, and supported Russian interests in several areas, especially foreign and energy policy.</p>

          <heading>Between Democratic Slippage, a Global Pandemic and the War in Ukraine</heading>
          <p>After over a decade in power, GERB’s rule came to be identified with corruption and a steady decline in democratic governance—a process witnessed across the countries of the former Soviet bloc. At the same time, Bulgaria has maintained its pro-EU orientation. Bulgaria held the rotational presidency of the Council of the EU for the first time in 2018, which proved a success, contrary to the expectations of some observers. Bulgaria made good strategic use of its EU presidency, gaining a reputation as a stabilizing factor in the region, and as a mediator between the EU and both the Western Balkans and Türkiye—an image that was subsequently damaged, however, when Bulgaria until mid-2022 vetoed the initiation of EU membership talks for North Macedonia.</p>
          <p>The European Parliament elections in May 2019 demonstrated Bulgaria’s continued commitment to EU values and the strong pro-EU orientation of the majority of the population, despite the political polarization and continued antagonism between GERB and the BSP. The elections were won by GERB, which reaffirmed its hold on power, securing six of the 17 seats allocated to Bulgaria, while the BSP won five seats (one more than in the previous elections). The DPS obtained three seats in the European Parliament (one fewer than before). The nationalist OP coalition was unable to overcome its internal disagreements, and all three parties contested the elections separately. Consequently, the nationalist vote was split and only VMRO—BND achieved the threshold for representation, securing two seats in the European Parliament. Some of the fragmented centre-right managed to combine forces and obtain one seat. A voter turnout of 32.6% was recorded (around three percentage points lower than in the previous European elections).</p>
          <p>At the same time, anti-democratic tendencies in the country deepened during the period in power of GERB, with media freedoms progressively deteriorating, legislative changes restricting political competition and the inclusion of new participants, and a prosecution office that has been accused of the systemic abuse of power and violations of the presumption of innocence. Major corruption scandals involving members of the governing coalition further eroded trust in national institutions. Political confrontation became the norm in public discourse, institutional relations and intra-party politics. The conflict between President Radev and Borisov was accompanied by internal conflicts within each parliamentary party. GERB suffered internal divisions with intra-party purges, as a result of corruption scandals; the BSP was torn by a confrontation between party Chairman Korneliya Ninova and former Prime Minister and BSP leader Stanishev, the longstanding President of the Party of European Socialists (during 2011-22); and the junior coalition partner in government, the OP alliance, split after Siderov of Ataka was ousted as its parliamentary leader.</p>
          <p>The COVID-19 pandemic further exacerbated the political situation, while also resulting in a huge reverse to the economy. The Government’s management of the pandemic deepened the conflict between the President and the Prime Minister, and that between GERB and the BSP.</p>
          <p>In July 2020 anti-Government protests demanding the resignation of Borisov and the Prosecutor-General, Ivan Geshev, erupted. This time, Borisov refused to resign, despite massive protests, but remained in power until the official end of his mandate. The protests engendered several new political formations, including a political movement led by former Ombudswoman Maya Manolova, called Izpravi se! Mutri vŭn! (Stand Up! Mafia, Get Out!), and a populist party headed by prominent folk-pop singer and television presenter Slavi Trifonov, Ima Takav Narod (ITN—There is such a People). Moreover, the Demokrati za Silna Balgariya (DSB—Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria) from the disbanded Reformatorski Blok united with other parties in a coalition known as Demokratichna Balgariya (DB—Democratic Bulgaria). Although GERB (in alliance with the SDS) technically won the legislative elections held on 4 April 2021, with 25.8% of the votes cast and 75 seats, the results represented a major decline in support for both GERB and the BSP za Balgariya (BSP for Bulgaria) coalition (with 14.8% and 43 seats). The effective winners were the anti-Government parties: ITN, the DB alliance and Manolova’s coalition.</p>
          <p>The April 2021 elections marked the beginning of yet another wave of political instability in recent Bulgarian history. Between April 2021 and April 2023 Bulgaria held five parliamentary elections and had a regular government for only nine months. Interim governments appointed by President Radev became the norm while a series of parliaments failed to agree on a governing formula. Thus, early elections were held in July 2021, November 2021, October 2022 and April 2023. The leading parties have changed significantly compared with just a few years ago. Although GERB still attracted the most votes in the elections of October 2022 and April 2023, the BSP’s vote-share dropped to under 10% in both elections, while new parties emerged as dominant political forces—namely Prodalzhavame Promyanata (PP—We Continue the Change), a new anti-corruption and pro-European party, and Vazrazhdane (Revival), a starkly nationalist and pro-Russian party.</p>
          <p>The April 2021 elections failed to produce a government and the National Assembly was dissolved on 12 May. Radev installed an interim Government, and further elections were scheduled for 11 July. On that day ITN, taking 24.1% of the votes cast and 65 seats, succeeded in narrowly defeating the GERB-SDS alliance, with 23.5% and 63 seats, marking the first time that GERB or a GERB-led coalition had not been placed first in elections. ITN received a mandate to form a new government, but subsequently failed to obtain a consensus among the protest and established parties, thus resulting in the third parliamentary elections to take place that year, which were scheduled concurrently with the first round of a presidential election on 14 November.</p>
          <p>A PP-led electoral coalition was placed first in the November 2021 legislative elections; benefiting from the popularity that the party’s leaders, Kiril Petkov and Asen Vassilev, had gained as ministers in the outgoing interim Government, it secured 25.7% of the votes cast and 67 seats, and took voter support from other protest parties. At the first round of the presidential election held on the same day, Radev secured 49.4% of the votes cast, and he was re-elected with 66.7% of the votes in the run-off round on 21 November. A new coalition Government was formed in December, under the premiership of Petkov, comprising his PP together with three coalition partners—the BSP, ITN and the DB alliance. The Government survived until June 2022, when it was removed by a parliamentary vote of no confidence, initiated by GERB after ITN ended its support for the Government and withdrew its members from their ministerial posts.</p>
          <p>Further early elections were scheduled for 2 October 2022. Although they were won by the GERB-SDS alliance, which received 25.3% of the votes cast and 67 seats, no consensus was reached on a government, leading to Radev’s appointment of an interim Government and another set of early elections on 2 April 2023. In these elections, the GERB-SDS alliance was similarly placed first, with 26.5% of the votes cast and 69 seats, closely followed by an alliance between PP and DB, which obtained 24.6% of the votes and 64 seats. GERB sought to form a coalition government with PP-DB; after several rounds of difficult negotiations and a second mandate granted by President Radev, the two alliances agreed on the establishment of a technocratic government with a rotating Prime Minister. On 6 June the new Government, headed by Nikolai Denkov of PP-DB, was approved by the National Assembly. Denkov was to be replaced by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, and former European Commissioner, Mariya Gabriel of GERB, after a period of nine months. Despite the strong antagonism and competition between the two leading blocs in parliament, GERB and PP-DB recognized as a greater threat the continued rise in electoral support for Vazrazhdane and the growth in pro-Russian sentiments in the country. </p>
          <p>
      The war in Ukraine divided public opinion and allowed parties like Vazrazhdane to thrive. With a large pro-Russian population, Bulgaria has been maintaining a delicate balance between its commitment to its Euro-Atlantic partners and pressure from the pro-Russian groups. Although Bulgaria enforced EU sanctions on Russia, phased out Russian oil deliveries, and provided military support for Ukraine, there has been continuous opposition from both inside and outside the National Assembly to these actions. The new Government is expected to face internal disagreements on a number of issues, including judicial reform, fighting corruption, the national budget and the allocation of EU recovery funds. What could help its hold on power and maintenance of political stability is the clear pro-European stance of both GERB and PP-DB. Once again, Bulgaria’s future is uncertain, politically, economically and geostrategically, and it depends on the ability of GERB and PP-DB to co-operate in government
