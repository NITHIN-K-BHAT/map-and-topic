                    <p id="BG.DIR.3">The Constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria, summarized below, took effect upon its promulgation, on 13 July 1991.</p>
                    <dir-section id="BG.DIR.4" sllink="SLSDOC" slsdocrf="DIR-SECTREF" usage="ewyb casee">
                         <heading>Fundamental Principles</heading>
                         <p id="BG.DIR.5">The Republic of Bulgaria is to have a parliamentary form of government, with all state power derived from the people. The rule of law and the life, dignity and freedom of the individual are guaranteed. The Constitution is the supreme law; the power of the state is shared between the legislature, the executive and the judiciary. The Constitution upholds principles such as political and religious freedom (although no party may be formed on separatist, ethnic or religious lines), free economic initiative and respect for international law.</p>

                         <heading>The Narodno Sobranie (National Assembly)</heading>
                         <p id="BG.DIR.9">The National Assembly is the legislature of Bulgaria. It consists of 240 members, elected for a four-year term. Only Bulgarian citizens aged over 21 years (who do not hold a state post or another citizenship, and are not under judicial interdiction or in prison) are eligible for election to parliament. A member of the National Assembly ceases to serve as a deputy while holding ministerial office. The National Assembly is a permanently acting body, which is free to determine its own recesses and elects its own Chairman and Deputy Chairmen.</p>
                         <p id="BG.DIR.10">The National Assembly may function when more than one-half of its members are present, and may adopt legislation and other acts by a majority of more than one-half of the members present, except where a qualified majority is required by the Constitution. The most important functions of the legislature are: the enactment of laws; the approval of the state budget; the scheduling of presidential elections; the election and dismissal of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers (Prime Minister) and of other members of the Council of Ministers; the declaration of war or conclusion of peace; the foreign deployment of troops; and the ratification of any fundamental international instruments to which the Republic has agreed.</p>

                         <heading>The President of the Republic</heading>
                         <p id="BG.DIR.12">The Head of State, the President of the Republic, is assisted by a Vice-President. The President and Vice-President are elected jointly, directly by the voters, for a period of five years. A candidate must be eligible for election to the National Assembly, but also aged over 40 years and a resident of the country for the five years previous to the election. To be elected, a candidate must receive more than one-half of the valid votes cast, in an election in which more than one-half of the eligible electorate participate. If necessary, a second ballot must then be conducted, contested by the two candidates who received the most votes. The one who receives more votes becomes President. The President and Vice-President may hold the same office for only two terms. If the President resigns, is incapacitated, impeached or dies, the Vice-President carries out the presidential duties. If neither official can perform their duties, the Chairman of the National Assembly assumes the prerogatives of the Presidency, until new elections take place.</p>
                         <p id="BG.DIR.13">The President’s main responsibilities include the scheduling of elections and referendums, the conclusion of international treaties and the promulgation of laws. The President is responsible for appointing a Prime Minister-designate (priority must be given to the leaders of the two largest parties represented in the National Assembly), who must then attempt to form a government.</p>
                         <p id="BG.DIR.14">The President has certain emergency powers, usually subject to the later approval of the National Assembly. Many of the President’s actions must be approved by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers. The President may return legislation to the National Assembly for further consideration, but can be overruled.</p>

                         <p id="BG.DIR.16">The principal organ of executive government is the Council of Ministers, which supervises the implementation of state policy and of the state budget, the administration of the country and the Armed Forces, and the maintenance of law and order. The Council of Ministers is headed and co-ordinated by the Chairman (Prime Minister), who is responsible for the overall policy of government. The Council of Ministers, which also includes Deputy Chairmen and Ministers, must resign upon the death of the Chairman or if the National Assembly votes in favour of a motion of no confidence in the Council or in the Chairman.</p>

                         <p id="BG.DIR.18">
            The judicial branch of government is independent. The Supreme Court of Cassation exercises supreme judicial responsibility for the precise and equal application of the law by all courts. The Supreme Administrative Court rules on all challenges to the legality of acts of any organ of government. The Supreme Judicial Council is responsible for appointments within the ranks of the justices, prosecutors and investigating magistrates, and recommends to the President of the Republic the appointment or dismissal of the Chairmen of the two Supreme Courts and of the Chief Prosecutor (they are each appointed for a single, seven-year term). These last three officials are, 
            <i>ex officio</i>
            , members of the Supreme Judicial Council, together with 22 others, who must be practising lawyers of at least 15 years' professional experience. These members are elected for a term of five years, 11 of them by the National Assembly and 11 by bodies of the judiciary. The Supreme Judicial Council is chaired by the Minister of Justice, who is not entitled to vote.

                         <p id="BG.DIR.21">Bulgaria is divided into regions and municipalities. Municipalities are the basic administrative territorial unit at which local self-government is practised; their principal organ is the municipal council, which is elected directly by the population for a term of four years. The council elects a mayor. Regional government is entrusted to regional governors (appointed by the Council of Ministers) and administrations, and is responsible for regional policy and the implementation of state policy at a local level.</p>

                         <p id="BG.DIR.23">The Constitutional Court consists of 12 justices, four of whom are elected by the National Assembly, four appointed by the President of the Republic and four elected by the justices of the two Supreme Courts. Candidates must have the same eligibility as for membership of the Supreme Judicial Council. They serve a single term of nine years, but a part of the membership changes every three years. A chairman is elected by a secret ballot of the members.</p>
                         <p id="BG.DIR.24">The Constitutional Court provides binding interpretations of the Constitution. It rules on the constitutionality of: laws and decrees; competence suits between organs of government; international agreements; national and presidential elections; and impeachments. A ruling of the Court requires a majority of more than one-half of the votes of all the justices.</p>

Amendments must be proposed by one-quarter of the parliamentary membership or by the President. In some cases, a majority of two-thirds of all the Members of the National Assembly will suffice.</p>

                         <p id="BG.DIR.28">A Grand National Assembly consists of 400 members, elected by the generally established procedure. It alone is empowered to adopt a new Constitution, to sanction territorial changes to the Republic, to approve changes to the form of state structure or form of government, and to enact amendments to certain parts of the existing Constitution (including those concerning the direct application of the Constitution, the domestic application of international agreements, and the irrevocable nature of fundamental civil rights and of certain basic individual rights, even in times of emergency or war).</p>
                         <p id="BG.DIR.29">Any bill requiring the convening of a Grand National Assembly must be introduced by the President of the Republic or by one-third of the members of the National Assembly. A decision to hold elections for a Grand National Assembly must be supported by two-thirds of the members of the National Assembly. Enactments of the Grand National Assembly require a majority of two-thirds of the votes of all the members, in three ballots on three different days. A Grand National Assembly may resolve only on the proposals for which it was elected, whereupon its prerogatives normally expire.</p>
