               <p id="HR.IS.3">The Republic of Croatia is situated in South-Eastern Europe and has a long western coastline on the Adriatic Sea. It is bordered to the north-west by Slovenia, to the north-east by Hungary and to the east by Serbia (the province of Vojvodina). Bosnia and Herzegovina abuts into Croatia, forming a southern border along the Sava river and an eastern border within the Dinaric Alps. The Croatian territory of Dubrovnik, which is situated at the southern tip of the narrowing stretch of Croatia (beyond a short coastal strip of Bosnia and Herzegovina), has a short border with Montenegro. The climate is continental in the hilly interior and Mediterranean on the coast. There is steady rainfall throughout the year, although summer is the wettest season. The average annual rainfall in Zagreb is 890&#160;mm (35&#160;ins). Both the ethnic Croats (who comprised 91.6% of the total population according to the 2021 census) and the Serb minority (3.2%) speak closely related languages of the Southern Slavonic group formerly referred to as variants of Serbo-Croat, but also known, respectively, as Croatian and Serbian. Croatian is written in the Latin script, while Serbian is more commonly written in the Cyrillic script. There are, in addition, a number of small minority communities in Croatia, notably the Slav Muslim (Bosniak) community. The national flag (proportions 1 by 2) consists of three horizontal stripes, of red, white and dark blue, with the arms of Croatia (a shield of 25 squares, alternately red and white, below a blue crown composed of five shields) fimbriated in red and white and set in the centre of the flag, overlapping all three stripes. The capital is Zagreb.</p>

                    <heading>Historical Context</heading>
                    <p id="HR.IS.5">From the 16th century the territory of what is now Croatia was divided between the OsmanlI (Ottoman—Turkish) and Habsburg (Austrian) Empires (although Dalmatia and Istria were dominated at different times by Venice and by France, while Ragusa—Dubrovnik—was formerly an independent republic). After the Hungarian revolution of 1848-49, Croatia and Slavonia (the north-eastern region of present-day Croatia) were made Austrian crown lands. The Habsburg Empire became the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary in 1867, and the territories were restored to the Hungarian Crown in the following year. Croatia gained its autonomy and was formally joined with Slavonia in 1881. Following the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the end of the First World War in October 1918, a Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (under the Serbian monarchy) was proclaimed on 4 December. The new Kingdom united Serbia, including Macedonia and Kosovo, with Montenegro and the Habsburg lands (modern-day Croatia, Slovenia and Vojvodina). King Aleksandar imposed a royal dictatorship in January 1929, formally renaming the country Yugoslavia in October. In 1934 the King was assassinated in France by Croat extremists.</p>
                    <p id="HR.IS.7">After German and Italian forces invaded Yugoslavia in 1941, the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), incorporating all of Bosnia and Herzegovina and parts of Serbia and Slovenia, as well as much of modern-day Croatia, was established on 9 April. The NDH was led by the leader of the Fascist Ustaša (Rebel) movement, Ante Pavelić. During the Ustaša regime armed resistance was waged by the Partisans, led by Josip Broz (Tito), the Croat-Slovene leader of the Komunistička Partija Jugoslavije (Communist Party of Yugoslavia). The NDH collapsed in 1945, and Croatia was restored to Yugoslavia as one unit of a federal communist republic, which became the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) in 1963.</p>
                    <p id="HR.IS.8">Following an increase in nationalism in Croatia, in December 1971 the Croatian communist leaders were obliged to resign, and were arrested; a purge of the republican branch of the ruling party, the Savez Komunista Hrvatske (SKH—League of Communists of Croatia), followed. In 1974 Tito introduced a new Constitution, which enshrined the federal and collective nature of the Yugoslav state. As the power of the SKH began to decline, however, Croatian nationalism re-emerged as a significant force. Franjo Tuđman formed the Hrvatska Demokratska Zajednica (HDZ—Croatian Democratic Union) in 1990, which rapidly became the main challenger to the ruling party, by then called the Savez Komunista Hrvatske—Stranka Demokratskih Promjena (SKH—SDP, League of Communists of Croatia—Party of Democratic Reform).</p>

                    <heading>Domestic Political Affairs</heading>
                    <p>At multi-party elections to the tricameral republican Assembly (Sabor), held in two rounds in April-May 1990, the HDZ obtained a majority in each of the chambers, with 205 out of 351 seats in total, while the SKH—SDP took 73 seats. Tuđman (who had campaigned in support of a Greater Croatia’) was elected President of Croatia. However, a Serb National Council’, based at Knin (in the south-western Krajina region), formed in July, organized a referendum on autonomy for the Croatian Serbs, which, despite attempts by the Croatian authorities to prohibit it, took place in late August and early September. In October the `Serb National Council’, announcing the results of the referendum, declared autonomy for the Krajina areas as the `Serb Autonomous Region (SAR) of Krajina’.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, in August 1990 the Socialist Republic of Croatia was renamed the Republic of Croatia. In that month the Assembly voted to dismiss the Croatian member of the Yugoslav federal State Presidency, Stjepan Šuvar, and replace him with Stjepan (Stipe) Mesić, then President of the Government (premier) of Croatia. In December the Assembly enacted a new republican Constitution, which declared Croatia’s sovereignty, its authority over its own armed forces and its right to secede from the SFRY. Tensions increased in January 1991, when the Croatian authorities refused to comply with an order by the federal State Presidency to disarm all paramilitary groups, and subsequently boycotted negotiations on the future of the federation. On 21 February Croatia asserted the primacy of its Constitution and laws over those of the SFRY. Later that month the self-proclaimed SAR of Krajina declared its separation from Croatia and its intention of uniting with Serbia. In April a Cro­atian National Guard was formed, replacing the Territorial Defence Force. On 19 May some 94% of the voters participating in a referendum favoured Croatia becoming a sovereign entity, while 92% rejected a federal Yugoslavia.</p>

                         <heading>Independence and War</heading>
                         <p>
            On 25 June 1991 Croatia and Slovenia declared independence from the SFRY. Two days later the SAR of Krajina declared its unification with the self-proclaimed Serb Community of Municipalities of Bosnian Krajina’, based in Banja Luka, in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Amid escalating fighting between the Croat and Serb communities in Croatia, in August an SAR of West Slavonia (in north-eastern Croatia) was declared; an SAR of Slavonia, Baranja and West­ern Srem (Sirmium) also proclaimed its autonomy later that month. In the same month Tuđman appointed a coalition Government, dominated by the HDZ. In October the Croatian Government refused to extend the three-month mora­torium on the process of dissociation from the SFRY that had been agreed during peace negotiations sponsored by the European Community (EC—later 
            <xr pageref="Y" ref="WB02047.IO.TXT">European Union, EU</xr>
            ) in The Hague, Netherlands, in July. By November the Yugoslav People’s Army (JNA), supported by Serbian irregular troops, had secured about one-third of Croatian territory. The main area of conflict was Slavonia, although Serbian and JNA attacks were also concentrated on the port of Zadar, in central Dalmatia. Meanwhile, in October principally Montenegrin units of the JNA attacked and besieged Dubrovnik. The eastern Slavonian town of Vukovar (where intense fighting had taken place) surrendered on 18 November, after the 13th ceasefire agreement negotiated by the EC, which supervised the subsequent civilian evacuation. (At least 260 civilians were massacred by JNA troops during the evacuation.) In December United Nations (UN) Security Council Resolution 724 provided for observers to be sent to the SFRY, in addition to a small team of civilian and military personnel. In the same month a `Republic of Serb Krajina’ (RSK), formed by the union of the three SARs, was proclaimed.
          </p>
                         <p>In November 1991 the Supreme Council (a special war cabinet, chaired by Tuđman) ordered all Cro­ats to vacate any federal posts that they held. On 5 December Mesić resigned as Yugoslavia’s nominal head of state; the federal Prime Minister, Ante Marković, resigned on 19 December. The EC initiated recognition of Croatia on 15 January 1992, and it was formally admitted to the UN in May.</p>
                         <p id="HR.IS.15">With more than 6,000 dead and 400,000 internally displaced in Croatia, the Croatian National Guard and the JNA signed a UN-sponsored, unconditional ceasefire on 2 January 1992. In February a 14,000-strong UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) was entrusted with ensuring the withdrawal of the JNA from Croatia and the demilitarization of the three Serb-held enclaves, which were designated UN Protected Areas (UNPAs). In the same month UNPROFOR’s mandate in Croatia was extended to cover those areas occupied by JNA troops and with majority Serb populations, but outside the official UNPAs. In May the JNA began to withdraw from Croatia. However, sporadic shelling continued, and UNPROFOR failed to prevent the expulsion of over 1,000 Croats by Serbian forces from East Slavonia. After Croat forces launched a series of offensives in Serb-held areas, UN Security Council Resolution 762 was adopted on 30 June, requiring the Croatian forces to withdraw to previous positions and to refrain from entering Serb-controlled areas. In July a military court in Split convicted 19 leading figures from the RSK of threatening the territorial integrity of Croatia. Shortly afterwards, the leaders of the RSK renounced their claims to independence.</p>
                         <p>Presidential and legislative elections (the latter to a new bicameral legislature comprising a directly elected Zastupnički Dom—Chamber of Representatives—and an indirectly elected Županijski Dom—Chamber of Counties) were held in Croatia on 2 August 1992. Tuđman was re-elected President, with 56% of the votes cast, defeating Dražen Budiša of the Hrvatska Socijalno-Liberalna Stranka (HSLS—Croatian Social Liberal Party). At the legislative elections the ruling HDZ obtained a majority, securing 85 of the 138 seats contested in the Chamber of Representatives. A new Government, under the premiership of Hrvoje Šarinić, was subsequently appointed. Elections to the Chamber of Counties were held on 7 February 1993. The HDZ won 37 of the elective 63 seats, while the HSLS and allied parties obtained 16 seats.</p>
                         <p>Meanwhile, in January 1993 Croatian troops launched an offensive across UN peacekeeping lines into Serb-held Krajina, subsequently regaining control of the strategic Maslenica bridge. President Dobrica Ćosić of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (comprising Serbia and Montenegro) warned the UN that, if UNPROFOR did not intervene, Yugoslavia would dispatch troops to defend the Serbs in Croatia. At local elections in Istria in February, a party advocating Istrian autonomy, the Istarski Demokratski Sabor (IDS—Istrian Democratic Assembly), obtained 72% of the votes cast. In March Šarinić’s Government resigned, and a former business executive, Nikica Valentić, was appointed Prime Minister.</p>
                         <p>In July 1993 the UN negotiated the Erdut Agreement between the leaders of Croatia and Serbia, whereby by the end of the month Croat forces were to leave the Maslenica area, which would be returned to UNPROFOR administration. However, the Croats failed to&#160;withdraw and fighting resumed. In August the Croatian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mate Granić, declared the Erdut Agreement invalid. Following worsening Serb-Croat hostilities, a UN-mediated ceasefire was agreed in mid-September. On 4 October the UN Security Council voted unanimously to extend UNPROFOR’s mandate by Resolution 871, which also required the return to Croatian sovereignty of all remaining areas occupied by JNA troops outside the UNPAs, and the disarmament of Serb paramilitary groups. The Resolution was rejected by the Assembly of the RSK, which proceeded to order the mobilization of all Serb conscripts in Krajina. Multi-party elections held in the RSK in December were declared illegal by the Constitutional Court of Croatia. In January 1994 Milan Martić, a candidate supported by President Slobodan Milošević of Serbia, was elected President’ of the RSK. In February Tuđman approved proposals, advanced by the USA, for the formation of a Bosniak (Muslim)-Croat federation within Bosnia and Herzegovina, as the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. (Croatian army units had from 1992 supported the self-styled breakaway Croat state in western Bosnia and Herzegovina, the `Croat Community of Herzeg-Bosna’.) Following the repeated extension of a ceasefire in the RSK, on 30 March 1994 it was agreed that an UNPROFOR-monitored buffer’ zone would be established there.</p>
                         <p>In April 1994 Tuđman suspended Josip Manolić, the President of the Chamber of Counties, from his position within the HDZ. Manolić, together with Mesić (by this time the President of the Chamber of Representatives), left the HDZ to form a new party, the Hrvatski Nezavisni Demokrati (HND—Croatian Independent Democrats). The HND, led by Mesić, became the largest opposition party in the Assembly, with 18 deputies.</p>
                         <p>Meanwhile, the ceasefire in the RSK continued precariously. In March 1995 Tuđman reversed a decision to expel UNPROFOR from Croatian territory, and agreed to a revised peacekeeping plan, following intensive diplomatic negotiations with the international community. A compromise UN mandate was to provide for a reduced peacekeeping force (the UN Confidence Restoration Operation—UNCRO) until October. In the same month a formal military alliance was announced between the Herzeg-Bosna and the (by that time predominantly Bosniak) Bosnian government armies. In April Bosnian Serb artillery attacked Dubrovnik and its airport. On 1-2 May Cro­atian government forces regained control of West Slavonia. The Croatian Serbs launched artillery attacks on Zagreb, Karlovac and Sisak. On 3 May, under the mediation of the UN Special Envoy, the warring parties agreed a ceasefire, according to which Serb artillery was to be surrendered to the UN, in exchange for the safe passage of all Serb civilians and troops from West Slavonia into Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>

                         <heading>`Operation Storm’</heading>
                         <p>In July 1995 a joint offensive by Croatian government forces and Herzeg-Bosna troops resulted in the seizure of the Serb-held town of Bosansko Grahovo, in western Bosnia and Herzegovina, thereby blocking the principal supply route from Serb-held areas of northern Bosnia and Herzegovina to Serb-held Krajina. On 4 August Croatian government troops launched a massive military operation (Operation Storm) and rapidly recaptured the Krajina enclave, as a result of which about 150,000 Croatian Serbs fled or were expelled to Serb-held areas in Bosnia and Herzegovina or to Serbia. In early September the UN announced that some 10,500 peacekeeping troops were to be withdrawn from Croatia, in view of the restoration of government authority over Krajina. On 20 September the Chamber of Representatives voted to suspend sections of the law on minorities, which had provided the Krajina Serbs with special rights in areas where they had been a majority, shortly after the adoption of a new electoral law reducing the reserved representation of the Serb minority in the Croatian legislature from 13 seats to three.</p>
                         <p>Amid allegations of state media bias, the HDZ secured about 45% of the votes cast in elections to the Chamber of Representatives on 29 October 1995, winning 75 of the 127 seats. A new Government was appointed in early November, headed by the erstwhile Minister of the Economy, Zlatko Matesa.</p>
                         <p>Meanwhile, on 3 October 1995 Croatian government officials and Serb leaders in East Slavonia signed an agreement on basic principles’, following talks in the Serb-held town of Erdut. In November an agreement was signed on the status of East Slavonia, which was to be placed under the authority of a UN-appointed transitional administration for up to two years prior to its full reintegration into Croatia. In January 1996 the UN Security Council established the UN Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium (UNTAES), with a mandate to supervise the demilitarization of the area, and the return of refugees and displaced persons. The UN Security Council also authorized the establishment of a UN Mission of Observers in Prevlaka (UNMOP) to assume responsibility for monitoring the demilitarization of the Prevlaka peninsula, south-east of Dubrovnik, which was claimed by Yugoslavia as part of Montenegro.</p>
                         <p>In April 1996 the Regional Executive Council of East Slavonia appointed a former RSK President’ (1992-94), Goran Hadžić, as President of the region. A new Regional Assembly (comprising representatives of Krajina and the five East Slavonian municipalities) and Executive Council were subsequently established. In the same month the Chamber of Representatives approved legislation providing for the transfer of authority to conduct criminal proceedings to the UN International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY—based in The Hague) and the extradition of the accused. A 30-day process for the demili­tarization of East Slavonia was completed on 20 June 1996.</p>
                         <p>
            In August 1996 an agreement pro­viding for the establishment of full diplomatic relations between Cro­atia and Yugoslavia was signed. In October the 
            <xr pageref="Y" ref="CE.IO">Council of Europe</xr>
             agreed to accept Croatia’s application for membership, after the Government undertook to ratify the European Convention on Human Rights.
          </p>
                         <p>In early April 1997 Serb officials in East Slavonia con­ducted a referendum (which the Croatian Government and UN officials declared to be illegitimate) regarding the future of the enclave; about 99.5% of the participating electorate voted in favour of East Slavonia remaining a single administrative unit under Serb control after its reintegration into Croatia. In mid-April elections to the Chamber of Counties and to a number of municipal and regional councils took place. The HDZ secured 42 of the 63 elective seats in the Chamber of Counties, while the Hrvatska Seljačka Stranka (HSS—Croatian Peasants’ Party) took nine, the HSLS six, the Socijaldemokratska Partija Hrvatske (SDP—Social Democratic Party of Croatia, which had been constituted from the former SKH—SDP) four, and the IDS two seats. (Tuđman nominated a further five deputies, of whom two were to be members of the Serb community in East Slavonia.) On 15 June Tuđman was re-elected President with 61.4% of the votes cast, defeating two other candidates; the Constitutional Court endorsed the results of the election later that month. Tuđman was inaugurated for a second term on 5 August.</p>
                         <p>Meanwhile, in July 1997 the Government announced the initiation of the programme for the return of some 80,000 Croat refugees to East Slavonia. East Slavonia was returned to Cro­atian authority in January 1998, when the mandate of UNTAES officially ended, and an increase in the number of Serbs leaving the region was reported. In May the Government announced a programme that relaxed conditions for the return of Serb refugees to Croatia, following international pressure.</p>

                         <heading>The Death of Tuđman and the Defeat of the HDZ</heading>
                         <p>In October 1998 Andrija Hebrang resigned as Minister of Defence and Vice-President of the HDZ. On 26 November 1999 the Assembly provisionally transferred the powers of head of state to the parliamentary Speaker, Vlatko Pavletić, after Tuđman underwent emergency medical treatment. Tuđman died on 10 December, and an election for his successor was scheduled for 24 January 2000.</p>
                         <p>At elections to the Chamber of Representatives on 3 January 2000, a coalition led by the SDP and the HSLS secured 47.0% of the votes cast and 71 of the 151 seats; the HDZ obtained 30.5% of the votes and 45 seats, and an alliance of five other opposition parties including the HSS and the IDS 15.9% and 25 seats. Of the nine candidates contesting the first round of the presidential election on 24 January, Mesić, who was the joint candidate of the four other principal opposition parties, secured 41.1% of the votes cast, while HSLS leader Budiša (representing the SDP-HSLS alliance) won 27.7% and the HDZ candidate, Granić, hitherto Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, 22.5%. On 27 January Pavletić appointed the Chairman of the SDP, Ivica Račan, as Prime Minister. In the second round of presidential voting on 7 February, Mesić secured 56.2% of the votes. On 9 February the Assembly adopted a motion expressing confidence in a new coalition Government formed by Račan.</p>
                         <p>In April 2000 Granić left the HDZ to form a new party, the Demokratski Centar (DC—Democratic Centre). In that month Ivo Sanader was elected leader of the HDZ. In May the Chamber of Representatives approved constitutional amendments guaranteeing representation in the legislature for those ethnic groups constituting more than 8% of the total population. Further amendments, adopted by the Chamber of Representatives in November 2000, re­duced the powers of the President and increased those of the legislature, which was to appoint the Government. In March 2001 the Government submitted a proposal to the Chamber of Representatives for the abolition of the Chamber of Counties. Despite opposition from the HDZ, the Chamber of Representatives approved a constitutional amendment converting the Assembly into a unicameral legislature.</p>
                         <p>In July 2001 the Government voted to extradite two Croat generals suspected of war crimes to the ICTY, precipitating the resignations of four HSLS ministers. In mid-July Račan’s administration won a motion of confidence in the Assembly, which also approved a statement reaffirming the Government’s policy of co-operation with the ICTY. Following the forced resignation of Budiša (who had strongly opposed the extradition) from the leadership of the HSLS, the four former representatives rejoined the Government. Later in July one of the indicted suspects, Gen. (retd) Rahim Ademi, surrendered to the ICTY. The other, Gen. (retd) Ante Gotovina, who had been indicted on similar charges, pertaining to having led Operation Storm in 1995, remained at large. In October 2001 Croatia signed a Stabilization and Association Agreement with the EU, which was ratified by the Assembly on 5 December.</p>
                         <p>In February 2002 Budiša was re-elected to the presidency of the HSLS; the HSLS leadership decided to remove the First Deputy Prime Minister, Goran Granić, and two further ministers from the Government, reportedly owing to their failure to support Budiša. The remaining three HSLS members in the Government subsequently tendered their resignations to demonstrate disagreement with the party leadership. However, in March Budiša became First Deputy Prime Minister, while Granić (henceforth an independent) and three of the HSLS representatives were reappointed to the Government.</p>
                         <p>In May 2002 Milan Martić, the former `President’ of the RSK, who had been indicted in 1996 for war crimes, in particular in connection with the bombardment of Zagreb in 1995, surrendered to the ICTY. In early July 2002 Budiša withdrew the HSLS from the government coalition, in opposition to the ratification of an agreement on Croatian-Slovenian joint ownership of the Krško nuclear power installation in Slovenia. Although Račan submitted his resignation, he was returned to the office of Prime Minister by Mesić, and a reconstituted Council of Ministers was approved by the Assembly on 30 July.</p>
                         <p>In December 2002 the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Croatia and Yugoslavia reached a provisional accord on the Prevlaka peninsula, allowing the UN Security Council to end the mandate of UNMOP; the peninsula was to remain demilitarized and joint maritime patrols were to be introduced. In February 2003 Croatia formally applied for EU membership.</p>
                         <p>In March 2003 a former army commander, Gen. (retd) Mirko Norac (the most senior officer to be convicted by a Croatian court), was sentenced to 12 years’ imprisonment for his involvement in the killing of some 50 Croatian Serb civilians in 1991; two further defendants received terms of 15 years and 10 years, respectively. (In May 2004 the ICTY issued an indictment against Norac on five further charges relating to an attack by Croatian troops in 1993.) In November 2003 the former leader of the self-proclaimed SAR of Krajina, Milan Babić, was charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity at the ICTY, in connection with the `ethnic cleansing’ of Croats from regions under his control in 1991-92. (Babić was sentenced to 13 years’ imprisonment in June 2004; he committed suicide in March 2006.)</p>

                         <p>Legislative elections were conducted on 23 November 2003. The HDZ obtained 66 of the 152 elective seats in the Assembly, while the SDP, led by Račan, won 43 seats (including 28 in coalition with other parties). After the HDZ negotiated agreements with an HSLS-DC coalition and the HSS, on 23 December a new, HDZ-dominated Government, headed by Sanader, was approved by 88 votes in the Assembly. The administration included former members of the Tuđman administration, notably Hebrang, as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Health and Social Welfare. The newly elected President of the DC, Vesna Škare-Ožbolt, was appointed as Minister of Justice.</p>
                         <p>In March 2004, following continued international pressure, two retired generals, Ivan Čermak and Mladen Markač, surrendered to the ICTY, on charges related to the seizure of Krajina by Croatian government forces in 1995. Croatia officially became a candidate country for EU membership in June 2004, subject to continued compliance with the ICTY.</p>
                         <p>At the first round of a presidential election on 2 January 2005, Mesić, supported by an SDP-led alliance, secured 48.9% of the votes cast; his principal opponent, Jadranka Kosor of the HDZ, a Deputy Prime Minister, won 20.3%. At the second round on 16 January, Mesić was re-elected President, with 65.9% of the votes. In February Sanader reorganized the Government, after Hebrang resigned from the Council of Ministers. Mesić was inaugurated as President on 18 February.</p>
                         <p>
            In March 2005, following an official report by ICTY Prosecutor Carla Del Ponte, stating that Croatia had failed to demonstrate full co-operation with the ICTY (with regard to Gotovina), the EU postponed the opening of accession negotiations; they officially began on 4 October, after Del Ponte stated that co-operation with the ICTY had improved. In December Gotovina was apprehended in the Canary Islands, Spain, reportedly as a result of information received from the Croatian authorities; his arrest effectively removed the main obstacle to the country’s membership of the 
            <xr pageref="Y" ref="NATO.IO">North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)</xr>
             and the EU. Extradited to the Tribunal, Gotovina pleaded not guilty to charges relating to the killing and expulsion of Serbs from the Krajina region in August-November 1995.
          </p>
                         <p>In February 2006 Sanader announced that Škare-Ožbolt had been removed from the post of Minister of Justice, and the DC withdrew from the Government. In January 2007 Račan resigned as SDP Chairman (he died in April, and Zoran Milanović was elected Chairman of the party in June). In June Martić was sentenced to 35 years’ imprisonment at the ICTY on 16 charges of war crimes. In the same month the trial began of Norac and Ademi (who had been transferred to the Croatian judiciary by the ICTY in November 2005).</p>
                         <p>At elections to the Assembly on 25 November 2007, the HDZ won 66 of the 153 seats, and the SDP 56. In December the Minister of the Interior, Ivica Kirin, tendered his resignation, after it emerged that he and other senior government officials had participated in a hunting trip with Mladen Markač (in violation of the conditions for Markač's provisional pre-trial release from the ICTY). Following lengthy negotiations, the HDZ formed a coalition with the HSS, the HSLS and the Samostalna Demokratska Srpska Stranka (SDSS—Independent Democratic Serb Party); the new Government was approved by the Assembly on 12 January 2008.</p>
                         <p>
            The trials of Gotovina, Markač and Čermak commenced at the ICTY in March 2008. In May, following trials at Zagreb County Court, Norac was sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment, while Ademi was acquitted. In October, after the fatal shooting of the daughter of a prominent lawyer, Sanader dismissed the Minister of the Interior and the Minister of Justice, together with the national chief of police. Tomislav Karamarko, hitherto the head of the Security and Intelligence Agency, received the interior portfolio. Later that month the editor of independent newspaper 
            <i>Nacional</i>
            , Ivo Pukanić, and another journalist were killed by a car bomb. (In November 2010 six men were sentenced by a court in Zagreb to prison terms ranging from 15 to 40 years, after being convicted of Pukanić’s murder.)

                         <heading>The Conviction and Acquittal of Gen. Gotovina</heading>
                         <p>In May 2009 an HDZ parliamentary deputy, Branimir Glavaš, fled to Bosnia and Herzegovina, after being convicted by a Zagreb court of atrocities against Serb civilians in Osijek in 1991 and sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment. On 1 July 2009 Sanader announced his resignation as Prime Minister; he named Jadranka Kosor as his successor to the premiership and to the chairmanship of the HDZ. Kosor’s nomination was approved by the Assembly on 6 July. In the first round of a presidential election on 27 December, Ivo Josipović of the SDP, a university professor, secured 32.4% of the votes cast; the Mayor of Zagreb and independent candidate Milan Bandić obtained 14.8% of the votes, and Hebrang of the HDZ won 12.1%. (Sanader was expelled from the HDZ in January 2010.) In the second round of the presidential election on 10 January, Josipović was elected to the presidency, with 60.3% of the votes cast. He was inaugurated on 18 February. In July the HSLS withdrew from the ruling coalition.</p>
                         <p>In September 2010 Glavaš was detained in Bosnia and Herzegovina at the request of the Croatian authorities, after his conviction had been confirmed, with a reduced sentence of eight years, by the Croatian Supreme Court. On 9 December Sanader (who had returned to the Assembly as an independent deputy) was detained in Austria, following an arrest warrant issued by Croatia.</p>
                         <p>In mid-April 2011 the ICTY convicted Gotovina and Markač of war crimes against the Serb population of the Krajina region in 1995, sentencing them to 24 years’ and 18 years’ imprisonment, respectively. (Čermak was acquitted.) Their sentences precipitated large protests. On 20 July 2011 the arrest of Goran Hadžić, the final indicted war crimes suspect to remain at large, was announced by the Serbian authorities; he was extradited to the ICTY. (Hadžić died in 2016.) Following his extradition from Austria, Sanader’s parliamentary immunity was removed in September 2011, and his trial on charges of corruption began on 3 November.</p>
                         <p>In legislative elections, which took place on 4 December 2011, the centre-left Kukuriku coalition, comprising the SDP, the Hrvatska Narodna Stranka-Liberalni Demokrati (HNS, Croatian People’s Party-Liberal Democrats), the IDS and the Hratska Stranka Umirovljenika (HSU—Croatian Pensioners’ Party), secured 45.7% of the votes cast and 80 of the 151 seats in the Assembly, defeating the HDZ, which obtained 18.4% of the votes and 47 seats. Josipović appointed SDP and Kukuriku leader Milanović as Prime Minister; his new Government, comprising members of the four coalition parties, was approved in the Assembly on 23 December. In May 2012 former Minister of the Interior Karamarko was elected Chairman of the HDZ, replacing Kosor.</p>
                         <p>In mid-November 2012 the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY overturned the convictions of Gotovina and Markač. The announcement was widely welcomed in Croatia, but prompted outrage in Serbia. On 20 November Sanader was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment for having received bribes while in office, in exchange for preferential contracts; further corruption cases against him continued.</p>

                         <p>
            Elections to the European Parliament took place in Croatia for the first time on 14 April 2013, with a voter participation rate of about 21%. The HDZ won six of the 12 seats available, while the SDP took five. Upon Croatia’s scheduled accession to the EU on 1 July (see 
            <i>Foreign Affairs</i>
            ), the Deputy Prime Minister responsible for Domestic, Foreign and European Affairs, Neven Mimica, resigned to become a European commissioner. In August controversy arose over legislation adopted the day before Croatia’s admission to the EU, which barred the extradition of those suspected of having committed crimes before August 2002. Croatia’s failure to extradite to Germany a former senior official of the State Security Service (SDS), Josip Perković, in connection with the murder of a Yugoslav defector in 1983, prompted criticism from the European Commission; it was announced that Croatia’s extradition legislation would be amended to conform with EU requirements, and Perković was arrested on 1 January 2014. The Supreme Court dismissed an appeal against his extradition to Germany. A former head of the SDS, Zdravko Mustač, was also extradited to Germany in April, in connection with the same killing. (Perković and Mustač were sentenced to life imprisonment in August 2016.) On 11 March 2014 Sanader and three other former HDZ officials were convicted of misappropriating funds from state companies for party activities during 2003-09; Sanader was sentenced to a further nine years’ imprisonment and ordered to repay US&#160;$2.8m., while the HDZ was to be liable for nearly $5.3m.
          </p>
                         <p>At elections to the European Parliament on 25 May 2014, the HDZ, in coalition with five other parties, including the extreme nationalist Hrvatska Stranka Prava (HSP—Croatian Party of Rights) and the HSS, secured six of the 11 seats allocated to Croatia, while an alliance of the SDP, the HNS, the HSU, the IDS and the SDSS won four seats. The rate of participation was 25.1%.</p>
                         <p>The first round of the presidential election on 28 December 2014 was contested by four candidates: the incumbent, Josipović of the SDP, was first-placed, with 39.1% of the votes cast, followed by Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović of the HDZ, with 37.8%. However, in the second round on 11 January 2015, Grabar-Kitarović, a former Minister of Foreign Affairs and hitherto a NATO official, narrowly defeated Josipović, securing 50.7% of the votes. She was inaugurated on 15 February.</p>
                         <p>In January 2015 the Constitutional Court overturned the Supreme Court’s 2010 conviction of Glavaš; he was welcomed by supporters upon his subsequent return to Osijek from Bosnia and Herzegovina. (In July 2016 the Supreme Court annulled his conviction; following protracted delays, his retrial began in Zagreb in July 2021.)</p>

                         <p>At legislative elections on 8 November 2015, the HDZ-led Domoljubna Koalicija (Patriotic Coalition) was narrowly first-placed, with 34.6% of the votes cast and 59 seats, while the SDP-led alliance Hrvatska Raste (Croatia is Growing) obtained 33.4% and 56 seats. A grouping of independents formed in 2012, Most Nezavisnih Lista (Most—Bridge of Independent Lists), headed by Mayor of Metković Božo Petrov, was third-placed, with 13.6% and 19 seats.</p>
                         <p>On 23 December 2015 Tihomir Orešković, a non-partisan businessman, was named as Prime Minister-designate. His new Government, comprising HDZ and Most representatives, as well as independents, was approved by the Assembly on 22 January 2016, despite opposition objections to the nomination of two HDZ candidates accused of far-right sympathies. HDZ Chairman Karamarko was appointed as First Deputy Prime Minister and Petrov as Deputy Prime Minister. Karamarko resigned from the Government in June, amid allegations of corruption, and differences between him and Orešković. The Government subsequently lost a vote of no confidence in the Assembly, which had been brought by the HDZ. On 20 June the Assembly voted to dissolve itself, and in mid-July President Grabar-Kitarović scheduled pre-term legislative elections. On the same day the SDP, the HNS, the HSU and the HSS signed an agreement reconstituting the Hrvatska Raste alliance as the Narodna Koalicija (People’s Coalition). Andrej Plenković, a member of the European Parliament, was elected Chairman of the HDZ, after Karamarko’s resignation from the post.</p>

                         <p>At the elections to the Assembly on 11 September 2016, the HDZ (in alliance with the HSLS and two smaller parties) was first-placed, with 40.4% of the votes cast and 61 seats, while the SDP-led Narodna Koalicija obtained 35.8% and 54 seats, Most won 8.6% and 13 seats and the populist Živi Zid (Human Shield—in coalition with five other parties) 5.3% and eight seats. The new Assembly was convened on 14 October, when Most leader Petrov was elected as its President. After another coalition agreement was signed between the HDZ and Most, a Government headed by Plenković was approved by 91 votes in the Assembly on 19 October. Plenković’s administration also included independents, notably Martina Dalić, a former finance minister, in the post of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Economy, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Crafts. New HDZ representatives included Davor Ivo Stier, who became Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign and European Affairs.</p>
                         <p>On 27 April 2017 Plenković dismissed three Most ministers for their failure to support Minister of Finance Zdravko Marić, a former senior executive at Croatia’s largest private firm Agrokor, which was discovered to be severely indebted; Most subsequently withdrew from the Government. In early May representatives of Most supported a motion expressing no confidence in Marić, which was narrowly defeated. Petrov subsequently resigned as legislative Chairman; he was replaced by Gordan Jandroković.</p>
                         <p>After the HDZ reached a coalition agreement with the liberal HNS (previously part of the SDP-led alliance) in order to avoid further pre-term legislative elections, on 9 June 2017 the Assembly approved a reorganized Government. HNS representatives included the new acting leader of the party, Predrag Štromar, as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Construction and Physical Planning. Stier subsequently resigned as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign and European Affairs, and was replaced by Marija Pejčinović Burić (also of the HDZ).</p>
                         <p>In November 2017 Slobodan Praljak, a former general and official of the Croat Republic of Herceg-Bosna’ proclaimed in 1993 during the Bosnian conflict, who had been sentenced to 20 years’ imprisonment by the ICTY in 2013, committed suicide by drinking poison at a tribunal appeal hearing after it had upheld the verdict against him. Parts of the Croatian media strongly criticized the ICTY’s conviction of Praljak (together with five other Bosnian Croats), which had also implicated former President Tuđman. Several thousand people, including senior ministers, attended a commemoration service for Praljak in Zagreb.</p>

                         <p>Elections to the European Parliament were held on 26 May 2019.

            The Ministers of Public Administration and of State Property resigned in July 2019, following media allegations of wrongdoing in property deals. A government reorganization was approved by the Assembly on 19 July. Seven newly appointed ministers included Gordan Grlić Radman of the HDZ as Minister of Foreign and European Affairs, while Minister of Internal Affairs Davor Božinović and Minister of Finance Marić additionally received a deputy premiership.
          </p>
                         <p>Meanwhile, in July 2019 former premier Milanović was officially nominated by the SDP as its candidate in the forthcoming presidential election. The first round of the election on 22 December was contested by 11 candidates: Milanović was narrowly first-placed, with 29.6% of votes cast, while Grabar-Kitarović, contesting the election as an independent candidate with the support of the HDZ, received 26.7% of the votes, and popular singer Miroslav Škoro, an independent, 24.5%. At a second round on 5 January 2020, Milanović was elected President, defeating Grabar-Kitarović with 52.7% of votes cast. The rate of participation by the electorate was 51.2% in the first round and 55.0% in the second. Milanović was inaugurated on 18 February.</p>

                         <p>In January 2020 Plenković dismissed Minister of Health Milan Kujundžić of the HDZ, after Kujundžić admitted to `irregularities’ in the declaration of his property assets, following media allegations. The first case of COVID-19 was reported in Croatia on 25 February. On 18 March the Assembly adopted legislation increasing the authority of the National Civil Protection Headquarters to order wide-ranging containment measures at national level. An earthquake struck Zagreb on 22 March, injuring 27 people (one later died). On 23 April the Government announced the staged easing of pandemic-related restrictions.</p>
                         <p>Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence Damir Krstičević tendered his resignation in May 2020, after a training aircraft crashed near Zadar, killing two pilots. Meanwhile, following concerns that a resurgence in COVID-19 cases could disrupt the legislative elections due to take place later that year, the Government announced an agreement with the opposition to bring forward the polls; the Assembly was dissolved on 18 May. Shortly afterwards, President Milanović scheduled early elections for 5 July. The HDZ, contesting the elections as part of an alliance in some districts, unexpectedly strengthened its representation in the Assembly, attracting 37.3% of the votes and winning 66 seats. The SDP-led Restart Koalicija (Restart Coalition) obtained 24.9% of the votes and 41 seats, and a coalition of nationalist and environmentalist groups, led by the Domovinski Pokret Miroslava Škore (Miroslav Škoro Homeland Movement—newly established by former presidential candidate Škoro), was placed third, with 10.9% of the votes and 16 seats. Most recorded a decline in support, obtaining 7.4% of the votes and eight seats, while a left-wing alliance led by the environmentalist Možemo!—Politička Platforma (We Can!—Political Platform) secured 7.0% and seven seats. A participation rate of 46.4% was recorded (the lowest since the elections of 1990). On 23 July a new Government, again under the premiership of HDZ leader Plenković, and principally comprising members of the HDZ, was approved by the Assembly. Boris Milošević of the SDSS was appointed as Deputy Prime Minister for Social Affairs and Human Rights, and Mario Banožić, hitherto Minister of State Property, succeeded Krstičević as Minister of Defence.</p>
                         <p>In response to a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases, restrictions were reintroduced on 28 November 2020 (and subsequently extended). A further earthquake struck near the central town of Petrinja on 29 December, killing at least seven people. Some restrictions were eased from 1 March 2021, by which time a vaccination programme against COVID-19 had commenced. In mid-November the Government made vaccine certificates mandatory for access to public facilities. Shortly afterwards, some 15,000-20,000 people staged a rally in central Zagreb in protest against that decision and other restrictions. (All COVID-19-related international entry restrictions and most domestic measures were lifted with effect from 2 May 2022.)</p>
                         <p>Meanwhile, local elections had taken place on 16 and 30 May 2021. The HDZ suffered losses in the mayoral elections, securing 56 posts, compared with 63 previously, while independent candidates took 28 mayoralties and the SDP 22. Notably, in Zagreb (where the longstanding Mayor, Milan Bandić, had died), the environmentalist candidate, Tomislav Tomašević of Možemo!, secured victory in a second round of voting.</p>
                         <p>Croatia’s former Minister for Regional Development and EU Funds during 2016-19, Gabrijela Žalac (a senior member of the HDZ), and three others were arrested in November 2021 on suspicion of corruption in relation to a software contract, as part of an operation by the EU’s European Public Prosecutor’s Office. (Žalac was released from investigative custody in January 2022.)</p>

            Meanwhile, on 25 February 2022, one day after the Russian Federation’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Assembly adopted a 10-point declaration condemning Russian aggression and demanding the withdrawal of its troops from Ukrainian territory.

            On 29 April the Assembly approved the appointment of Anja Šimpraga of the SDSS as Deputy Prime Minister and Marin Piletić of the HDZ as Minister of Labour, Pensions, Family and Social Policy, replacing, respectively, Milošević and Josip Aladrović, who were reported to be under investigation for corruption; at the same time, Davor Filipović of the HDZ became Minister of the Economy and Sustainable Development, succeeding Tomislav Ćorić. The appointment of professor of economics Marko Primorac as Minister of Finance was approved in mid-July, after Marić unexpectedly resigned. The Minister of Maritime Affairs, Transport and Infrastructure, Oleg Butković, also received the additional role of Deputy Prime Minister.
          </p>
                         <p>In July 2023 President Milanović for the first time used his constitutional power to convene an extraordinary session of the Assembly to discuss a lengthy strike by employees in the judiciary; his decision incurred criticism from Plenković, amid increasing acrimony between the two leaders. The strike action in the judicial system in support of higher wages ended in late July. In October a court in Osijek sentenced four football supporters to 30 days’ imprisonment for singing fascist Ustaša songs at a match between Croatia and Türkiye (as Turkey had been redesignated in June 2022). Following the conclusion of his retrial at Zagreb County Court, on 27 October Glavaš was sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment; shortly afterwards, he fled to Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
                         <p>In mid-November 2023 Minister of Defence Banožić was removed, after the judicial authorities reported that he had caused a traffic accident in which the other driver was killed. (He was later charged with negligence in connection with the accident.) Banožić was replaced by a hitherto county prefect and senior HDZ official, Ivan Anušić, who was also appointed as a Deputy Prime Minister. Minister of the Economy and Sustainable Development Filipović and his adviser were dismissed in mid-December over suspected corruption in arrangements with a local television station; Filipović was replaced by an HDZ parliamentary deputy, Damir Habijan.</p>
                         <p>In January 2024 the Government presented to the Assembly draft changes to the criminal code that would penalize unauthorized leaks of material from criminal proceedings with prison sentences of up to three years. The proposed measure was condemned by Milanović and by the Croatian Journalists’ Association (but was adopted by the Assembly in March). Public dissatisfaction at the Government increased, after the Assembly in early February approved the HDZ’s nomination of Ivan Turudić as the new state Attorney-General (with effect from May); Turudić’s selection drew opposition criticism owing to his association with the HDZ and his alleged links with former officials accused of corruption. On 17 February an anti-Government protest, organized by 11 opposition parties led by the SDP, was staged in Zagreb to demand early legislative elections. At the end of that month the Assembly rejected an opposition motion for the dissolution of the legislature. However, following a meeting of HDZ officials, in early March Plenković announced that the Assembly would be dissolved, prior to early elections. In mid-March Milanović scheduled the elections for 17 April; although he declared his intention to be the prime ministerial candidate of the SDP, the Constitutional Court ruled that he would only be permitted to contest the elections if he first resigned as President.</p>

                    <p>In early 2007 a dispute between Croatia and Slovenia over their joint maritime boundary was revived. In March 2008 the Croatian Government agreed to postpone the implementation of an environmental fishing zone that it had declared in the Adriatic Sea until Cro­atia’s admission to the EU. In December the Slovenian Government announced that it would veto Croatia’s EU accession process, after Croatia presented documentation to the European Commission, which was considered by Slovenia to predetermine the maritime border. Nevertheless, in February 2009 Slovenia’s legislature ratified the protocols for Croatia’s accession to NATO, and on 1 April Croatia was admitted as a member of the Alliance. Following discussions between Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor and her Slovenian counterpart, it was agreed in September that the border dispute should not present an obstacle to Croatia’s EU accession negotiations. An agreement signed by the Governments of Croatia and Slovenia, under which international arbitrators were to delineate the joint border, was ratified by the Assembly on 20 November. In March 2013 the Croatian and Slovenian Governments signed a memorandum of understanding on a longstanding dispute over the reimbursement of Croatian depositors of Slovenia’s former Ljubljanska Banka, under which settlement was to be determined by international arbitration. Resolution of the issue allowed parliamentary ratification of Croatia’s accession treaty with the EU by Slovenia in early April. On 1 July Croatia duly became a member of the EU.</p>
                    <p>In July 2015 Croatia withdrew from the process on the border dispute at the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague, after evidence emerged of unauthorized conversations between the Slovenian judge at the Court and the Slovenian government representative. The PCA’s ruling in June 2017 awarded Slovenia around 75% of the Bay of Piran, as well as a maritime `corridor’ leading to international waters; however, Croatia refused to accept the judgment (arguing that it had withdrawn from the border dispute process), and both sides reported territorial violations. Slovenia officially began to implement the arbitration decision on 30 December. Minister of Foreign and European Affairs Gordan Grlić Radman announced in December 2020 that, following a meeting with his Slovenian and Italian counterparts, Croatia and Italy each intended to declare an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the Adriatic Sea. Accordingly, on 5 February 2021 the Croatian legislature unanimously adopted a decision declaring Croatia’s EEZ.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, despite the failure to ratify a 1999 agreement regarding the delineation of a small border area on the Adriatic Sea, in June 2013 representatives of the Governments of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina signed an agreement in Brussels, Belgium, on Bosnia and Herzegovina’s use of the Croatian port of Ploče and on Croatian transit traffic through the Bosnian coastal town of Neum.</p>

          During a visit to Zagreb in June 2007, the President of Serbia, Boris Tadić, issued an unprecedented apology to the Croatian people for atrocities committed by Serbs during the war. In November 2008 the 
          <xr pageref="Y" ref="IO-UN.527">International Court of Justice (ICJ)</xr>
           ruled that it had jurisdiction to hear a case of genocide brought by Croatia against Serbia (as the successor state to the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, and Yugoslavia), pertaining to crimes allegedly committed by Yugoslav forces in Croatia in 1991-95, which had been submitted to the Court in 1999. In January 2010 Serbia submitted a genocide counter-case against Croatia for alleged war crimes committed in 1995. In early February 2015 the ICJ rejected Croatia’s genocide case against Serbia, on the grounds that Croatia had failed to substantiate its allegations; Serbia’s counter-claim was also rejected.
        </p>
                    <p>At the invitation of President Grabar-Kitarović, her Serbian counterpart, Aleksandar Vučić, made his first official visit to Zagreb in February 2018, when he presented Grabar-Kitarović with files on ethnic Serbs missing from the 1991-95 war. However, in April 2018 a Croatian parliamentary delegation curtailed its visit to Serbia, after extreme nationalist leader Vojislav Šešelj insulted the representatives and the Croatian flag inside the chamber of the Serbian legislature. A statement made by Vučić at a commemoration ceremony for Serb victims of Operation Storm in August, which compared Croatia’s treatment of ethnic Serbs to the acts of Second World War Nazi Germany, caused the cancellation of a planned visit by Grabar-Kitarović to Serbia. In January 2022 the Croatian Minister of Culture and Media formally rejected a new Law on Cultural Heritage adopted by Serbia, which claimed the dual heritage (with Croatia) of literature created during the 1358-1808 Republic of Dubrovnik. A visit by Serbian Prime Minister Ana Brnabić to Zagreb on 30 April 2023, when she met Plenković, following an exchange of ministerial visits earlier that year, indicated some improvement in bilateral relations. However, in November the Croatian Government denounced Serbia’s expulsion of a Croatian diplomat for the alleged violation of `diplomatic norms’, subsequently expelling a Serbian diplomat in retaliation.</p>
                    <p>An escalation in refugee arrivals during 2015 precipitated a regional crisis and increased tensions between states in Central and South-Eastern Europe. In mid-September the Hungarian Government sealed its border with Serbia, causing migrants seeking asylum in Western Europe to divert their route via Croatia; in response, the Croatian authorities temporarily closed border crossings with Serbia. In March 2016 Slovenia announced that it would only admit migrants seeking asylum in that country or in clear humanitarian need; Croatia and Serbia subsequently imposed similar measures. The Croatian Government participated in the EU’s refugee relocation scheme; however, in December 2018 international monitoring organization Human Rights Watch presented findings that the Croatian police had committed acts of abuse and extortion against migrants attempting to enter the country.</p>
                    <p>In July 2020 EU ministers of finance approved Croatia’s admission to the exchange rate mechanism (ERM-II), as a prerequisite for its planned adoption of the euro, and in June 2022 the European Commission and the European Central Bank confirmed that Croatia had fulfilled the economic criteria required to adopt the euro on 1 January 2023. On 8 December 2022 the Council of the EU approved the admission of Croatia to the Schengen area. On 1 January 2023 Croatia accordingly both officially adopted the euro and was admitted to the Schengen zone, thereby removing the need for border and customs checks at its borders with other members of the zone. Slovenia reintroduced temporary controls at its borders with Croatia and Hungary on 21 October, and in early November Croatia, Slovenia and Italy agreed measures, including the launch of joint border patrols, to increase co-operation in addressing irregular migration.</p>
                    <p>In early August 2023 over 100 Croatian nationals were placed in pre-trial detention in Greece, in connection with violent clashes between supporters of the Greek and Croatian football teams in the capital, Athens, which had resulted in the death of one Greek supporter. President Milanović criticized the mass detentions, causing some tensions between the Croatian and Greek Governments. However, in September a further 10 football supporters were arrested in Croatia, in response to warrants issued by Greece.</p>
                    <p>Amid escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine, in January 2022 President Milanović stated that Croatia would recall its troops from NATO forces stationed in eastern Europe in the event of a Russian offensive against Ukraine (a stance that appeared to be contradicted by the Croatian Government). The Ukrainian foreign ministry subsequently summoned the Croatian ambassador to protest. However, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, the Government announced that Croatia would dispatch infantry weapons and defence equipment worth some €16.5m. to Ukraine, after the Ukrainian Government requested military aid. The Russian Government in July added Croatia to a list of states considered to have undertaken `unfriendly actions towards Russian companies and citizens’. A co-ordination forum on support for Ukraine was convened in Zagreb in October, attended by international delegates, including the Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi. During 2022 at least 11,000 Ukrainians sought refuge in Croatia, after fleeing from the conflict. By the end of 2023, according to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, a total of 24,150 refugees from Ukraine had been recorded in the country.</p>

               <p id="HR.IS.79">In 2022 Croatia recorded a visible merchandise trade deficit of US&#160;$18,905.5m., while there was a deficit of $1,462.4m. on the current account of the balance of payments.

        Croatia acceded to the 
        <xr pageref="Y" ref="WB02047.IO.TXT">European Union (EU)</xr>
         on 1 July 2013, and an EU excessive deficit procedure was officially closed in June 2017, after Croatia’s budget deficit was reduced to below 3% in conformity with EU criteria. In October Croatia presented a national strategy for the introduction of the euro (notably involving the reduction of public debt to no more than 60% of GDP). The COVID-19 pandemic had a severe economic impact in Croatia, owing to the suspension of the important tourism industry; Croatia’s GDP contracted by 8.6% in 2020 overall. In mid-March the Government adopted support measures, which included the payment of minimum wages. Despite the ensuing fiscal deterioration, Croatia was formally admitted to the EU’s Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM-II) in July. A long-delayed liquefied natural gas terminal and pipeline project on the Croatian island of Krk (as part of plans to assume a greater national role in EU energy policy) was inaugurated in January 2021. The easing of pandemic-related travel restrictions allowed rapid recovery in the tourism sector, and overall GDP growth in that year rebounded by a record 13.1%. However, the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, precipitating an energy crisis and inflationary pressures in Europe, had a negative impact on the Croatian economy. The Government in September adopted measures worth around €2,800m. in an effort to reduce the impact of high energy prices, including the introduction of a special tax on the profits of energy companies. Following confirmation by the European Commission and the European Central Bank in mid-2022 that Croatia had fulfilled the necessary economic criteria, Croatia was admitted to the euro area on 1 January 2023. In October the World Bank forecast that GDP growth would moderate from 6.3% in 2022 to 2.7% in 2023, although private consumption and demand in the tourism industry remained strong, alongside investment activity supported by EU funding. According to official figures, the rate of consumer price inflation had decelerated to 4.5%
        
        , year-on-year, by December, compared with a rate of 7.8% in August.
