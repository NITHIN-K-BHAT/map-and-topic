          <p id="CZ.GEOG.1">The Czech Republic (Czechia) is a landlocked state located in Central Europe, covering an area of 78,871 sq&#160;km (30,452 sq&#160;miles). It comprises the lands of Bohemia and Moravia and part of the historic region known as Silesia, most of which is now in Poland. The country is bordered by Poland to the north, Slovakia to the east, Germany to the west and Austria to the south.</p>
          <p id="CZ.GEOG.2">Bohemia, the westernmost of the Czech Lands, covers the region drained by the upper Labe (Elbe) and its tributary, the Vltava (Moldau), on which the capital, Prague (Praha), stands. This region is a plateau (average height 500&#160;m), bordered to the north-west and south-west by low ranges of mountains (the Krušné Hory, or Erzgebirge, and the Český Les, or Böhmerwald, respectively), which form a natural frontier with Germany. The Krkonoše Hory (Riesengebirge) range, the highest of the Sudetic (Sudeten) mountains, marks the border with Poland, rising to 1,603&#160;m (5,259 ft) at Mount Sněžka. Several important rivers, including the Vltava and the Ohře, rise in the south-western hill country and flow north into the Labe, and hence into the North Sea. Moravia, in the east of the country, is a mainly lowland region, which has traditionally been a crossing-point between Poland and south Central Europe. It is drained by the Dyje and Morava rivers; the latter forms part of the border with Slovakia and flows south to join the Danube (Dunaj) on the borders of Slovakia and Austria. Eastern Moravia is more rugged and mountainous, with the Little and White Carpathian Mountains forming the rest of the border with Slovakia.</p>
