                    <p id="CZ.DIR.3">The following is a summary of the main provisions of the Constitution of the Czech Republic, which was adopted on 16 December 1992 and entered into force on 1 January 1993, as subsequently revised on numerous occasions:</p>

                         <heading>General Provisions</heading>
                         <p id="CZ.DIR.5">The Czech Republic is a sovereign, unified and democratic law-abiding state, founded on respect for the rights and freedoms of the individual and citizen. All state power belongs to the people, who exercise this power through the intermediary of legislative, executive and judicial bodies. The fundamental rights and freedoms of the people are under the protection of the judiciary.</p>
                         <p id="CZ.DIR.6">The political system is founded on the free and voluntary operation of political parties respecting fundamental democratic prin­ciples and rejecting force as a means to assert their interests. Political decisions derive from the will of the majority, expressed through the free ballot. Minorities are protected in decision-making by the majority.</p>
                         <p id="CZ.DIR.7">The territory of the Czech Republic encompasses an indivisible whole, whose state border may be changed only by constitutional law. Procedures covering the acquisition and loss of Czech citizenship are determined by law. No one may be deprived of his or her citizenship against his or her will.</p>

                              <p id="CZ.DIR.10">Legislative power in the Czech Republic is vested in two chambers, the Poslanecká Sněmovna (Chamber of Deputies) and the Senát (Senate). The Chamber of Deputies has 200 members, elected for a term of four years. The Senate has 81 members, elected for a term of six years. Every two years one-third of the senators are elected. Both chambers elect their respective Chairmen and Deputy Chairmen from among their members. Members of both chambers of the legislature are elected on the basis of universal, equal and direct suffrage by secret ballot. All citizens of 18 years and over are eligible to vote.</p>
                              <p id="CZ.DIR.11">The legislature enacts the Constitution and laws; approves the state budget and the state final account; and approves the electoral law and international agreements. It elects the President of the Republic (at a joint session of both chambers), supervises the activities of the Government, and decides upon the declaration of war.</p>
