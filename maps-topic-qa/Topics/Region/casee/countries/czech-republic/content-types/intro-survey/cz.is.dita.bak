               <p id="CZ.IS.3">The Czech Republic (Czechia) lies in Central Europe and comprises the Czech Lands of Bohemia and Moravia, and part of Silesia. Its neighbours are Poland to the north, Germany to the north-west and west, Austria to the south, and Slovakia to the east. The climate is continental, with warm summers and cold winters. The average mean temperature is 9°C (49°F). Czech, a member of the west Slavonic group, is the official language. There is a sizeable Slovak minority and also small Polish, German, Silesian, Roma, Hungarian and other minorities. The major religion is Christianity (principally Roman Catholicism). The national flag (proportions 2 by 3) has two equal horizontal stripes, of white and red, on which is superimposed a blue triangle (half the length) at the hoist. The capital is Prague (Praha).</p>

                    <heading>Historical Context</heading>
                    <p id="CZ.IS.5">In October 1918, following the collapse of the Austro-Hun­garian Empire, the Republic of Czechoslovakia was established. The new state united the Czech Lands of Bohemia and Moravia, which had been incorporated into the Austrian Empire in the 16th and 17th centuries, and Slovakia, which had been under Hungarian rule for almost 1,000 years. In 1938 the British, French and Italian Prime Ministers concluded an agreement with the German Nazi leader, Adolf Hitler, whereby the Sudetenland (an area mostly in northern Bohemia, inhabited by German speakers) was ceded to Germany, and other parts of Czecho­slovakia were transferred to Hungary and Poland. Nazi armed forces occupied the remainder of Czechoslovakia in March 1939, and a German protectorate was established in Bohemia and Moravia. In Slovakia, which had been granted self-government in late 1938, a separate state was formed, under the pro-Nazi regime of Jozef Tiso.</p>
                    <p id="CZ.IS.6">After Germany’s defeat in the Second World War in 1945, the pre-1938 frontiers of Czechoslovakia were restored, although a small area in eastern Slovakia was ceded to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). Almost all of the German-speaking inhabitants of the country were expelled, and the Sudetenland was settled by Czechs from other parts of Bohemia. In response to Slovakian demands for greater autonomy, a legislature (the Slovenská Národná Rada—Slovakian National Council) and an executive Board of Commissioners were estab­lished in Bratislava, the principal Slovakian city. At elections in 1946, the Komunistická Strana Československa (KSČ—Communist Party of Czechoslovakia) emerged as the leading party. The party’s leader, Klement Gottwald, became Prime Minister in a coalition Government, and communist control became complete on 25 February 1948. A People’s Republic was established on 9 June. Gottwald succeeded Eduard Beneš as President, a position that he held until his death in 1953. The country aligned itself with the Soviet-led Eastern European bloc, and there were many political trials. Although these ended under Gottwald’s successors, Antonín Zápotocký and, from 1956, Antonín Novotný, there was no relaxation of policy until 1963, when a new Government, with Jozef Lenárt as Prime Minister, was formed. Meanwhile, the country was renamed the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, under a new Constitution, proclaimed in 1960.</p>
                    <p id="CZ.IS.8">In January 1968 Alexander Dubček succeeded Novotný as First Secretary of the KSČ, and in March Gen. Ludvík Svoboda succeeded Novotný as President. Oldřich Černík became Prime Minister in April. The new Government envisaged widespread reforms. In August, however, an estimated 600,000 Warsaw Pact forces invaded Czecho­slovakia, occupying Prague and other major cities. Mass demonstrations in protest at the invasion were held throughout the country, and many people were killed in clashes with occupation troops. The Soviet Government exerted pressure on the Czecho­slovak lead­ers to suppress their reformist policies, and in April 1969 Dubček was replaced by a fellow Slovak, Gustáv Husák, as First (subsequently General) Secretary of the KSČ. Under Husák’s leadership, there was a purge of the KSČ membership and the Government. The reforms were duly abandoned, with the exception of the federalization programme. This was implemented in January 1969, when the unitary Czechoslovak state was transformed into a federation, with separate Czech and Slovakian Republics, each having its own legislature and government. A Federal Government was established as the supreme executive organ of state power, and the legislature was transformed into a bicameral Federální Shromáždění (Federal Assembly). The first legislative elections since 1964 were held in November 1971, and 99.8% of the votes cast were in favour of candidates of the Národný Front (National Front—the communist-dominated organi­zation embracing all legal political parties in Czecho­slovakia).</p>
                    <p id="CZ.IS.9">In May 1975 Husák was appointed to the largely ceremonial post of President of Czechoslovakia, retaining his positions of Chairman of the Národný Front and General Secret­ary of the KSČ. He was replaced in the latter post by Miloš Jakeš, an economist and member of the Presidium of the party’s Central Committee, in December 1987. Repressive measures continued against the Catholic Church and dissident groups, such as Charta 77 (Charter 77—established in January 1977), which played a leading role in anti-Government demonstrations from 1988. In February 1989 the Czech playwright Václav Havel (a leader of Charta 77) was sen­tenced to nine months’ imprisonment. (He was released in May, following international condemnation.)</p>
                    <p id="CZ.IS.11">In November 1989 the protest action evolved into a process of largely peaceful political change, which subsequently became known as the velvet revolution’. On 17 November a mass anti-Government demonstration in Prague was violently dispersed by the police; large numbers of demonstrators (mainly students) were injured. Protests continued in Prague and in other towns. Later that month several opposition and human rights organizations, including Charta 77, were united in an informal alliance, the Občanské Fórum (OF—Civic Forum), which rapidly attracted popular support. On 24 November it was announced that Jakeš and the entire membership of the Presidium of the Central Committee had resigned. Karel Urbánek succeeded Jakeš as General Secretary, and a new Presidium was elected. Opposition demands for the ending of censorship and the release of all political prisoners were accepted by the authorities, and at the end of November the articles guaranteeing the KSČ’s predominance were deleted from the Constitution.</p>
                    <p id="CZ.IS.14">In December 1989 the OF and its Slovakian counterpart, Verejnosť Proti Násiliu (VPN—Public Against Violence), denounced the composition of the reorganized Government, which included only five non-communists. Ladislav Adamec resigned as Prime Minister, and was replaced by Marián Čalfa. In the following week a new, interim Federal Government was formed, with a majority of non-communist members. Husák resigned as Federal President and, at the end of December, was replaced by Havel. Dubček was elected Chairman of the Federal Assembly. Meanwhile, at an emergency congress of the KSČ the position of General Secretary of the Central Committee was abolished. Adamec was ap­pointed to the new post of Chairman of the party.</p>
                    <p id="CZ.IS.15">In April 1990 the Federal Assembly voted to rename the country the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic (CzSFR), thereby satisfying Slovakian demands that the new title should reflect the equal status of Slovakia within the federation. On 8-9 June the first democratic legislative elections since 1946 were held in Czechoslovakia, with the participation of some 97% of the electorate. In the elections at federal level, the highest proportion of the votes cast (about 46%) was secured by the OF, in the Czech Lands, and by VPN in Slovakia. The KSČ, with about 14% of the votes, obtained the second highest representation in the Federal Assembly. The Křesťanská a Demokratická Unie (KDU—Christian Democratic Union), a coalition of the Československá Strana Lidová (ČSL—Czechoslovak People’s Party), the Křesťanskodemokratická Strana (KDS—Christian Democratic Party) and the Slovakian-based Kresťanskodemokratické Hnutie (KDH—Christian Democratic Movement), received some 12% of the votes. The new Federal Assembly was to serve a transitional two-year term, during which time it was to draft new federal and republican constitutions and elect a new Federal President. In June Dubček was re-elected Chairman of the Federal Assembly and a new Federal Government, comprising representatives of the OF, VPN, the KDH and independents, was established. In early July Havel was re-elected President.</p>
                    <p id="CZ.IS.19">In late 1990 divisions increased between the moderate Slovakian movements, such as VPN and the KDH, and more radical parties, which campaigned for full independence. In March 1991 Vladimír Mečiar, the Slovakian Prime Minister and a founding member of VPN, announced the formation of a minority faction within VPN known as the Hnutie za Demokratické Slovensko (HZDS—Movement for a Democratic Slovakia), which supported greater autonomy. Meanwhile, there had been a split within the OF, with conservatives and economic liberals forming the Občanská Demokratická Strana (ODS—Civic Democratic Party), led by Václav Klaus. In April the Slovakian National Council voted to remove Mečiar from the Slovakian premiership, after which the HZDS was established as a separate political group.</p>
                    <p id="CZ.IS.20">Following the legislative elections of 5-6 June 1992, the ODS, led by Klaus, which (in coalition with the KDS) won about 34% of the votes cast in the Czech Lands, became the largest party in the 300-member Federal Assembly, with a total of 85 seats. Two other splinter groups from the former OF, including the Občanská Demokratická Aliance (ODA—Civic Democratic Alliance), failed to win representation in the Federal Assembly. Mečiar’s HZDS emerged as the dominant political force in Slovakia, obtaining 57 seats (the second largest representation) in the Assembly. The leading party in the Slovakian Government, the KDH (which advocated a continued federation), secured only 14 seats, one seat fewer than the separatist Slovenská Národná Strana (SNS—Slovak National Party). The successor organizations to the communist parties of the two republics achieved considerable success: the Levý Blok (Left Bloc), which included the Komunistická Strana Čech a Moravy (KSČM—Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia), won a total of 34 seats in the Federal Assembly.</p>
                    <p id="CZ.IS.21">In late June 1992 a new, HZDS-dominated Slovakian Government was announced, with Mečiar as Prime Minister. A transitional Federal Government, dominated by members of the ODS and the HZDS, was appointed in early July under Jan Stráský of the ODS. A new coalition Czech Government, led by Klaus and dominated by the ODS, was also appointed in early July. Havel resigned in mid-July following three attempts to elect a President in the Federal Assembly, in which the HZDS and the SNS had prevented his re-election.</p>
                    <p id="CZ.IS.22">Following the events of June-July 1992, on 17 July the Slovakian National Council approved a (symbolic) declaration of Slovakian sovereignty, and in the following week the Czech and Slovakian Prime Ministers agreed to the dissolution of the CzSFR, with effect from 1 January 1993. In October 1992 the Czech and Slovakian Governments ratified a number of accords, including a customs union treaty abolishing trade restrictions between the two republics following independence. On 25 November the Federal Assembly adopted legislation providing for the constitutional disbanding of the federation, having secured the necessary three-fifths’ majority. Accordingly, the Federal Government accel­erated the process of dividing the country’s assets and liabilities as well as its armed forces (mainly in the ratio of 2 to 1—the proportion of the Czech and Slovak populations within Czechoslovakia).</p>

                    <p id="CZ.IS.23">In anticipation of the establishment of the Czech Republic as an independent state, a bicameral body was introduced under a new Constitution, which was adopted on 16 December 1992; the 200-member Česká Národní Rada (Czech National Council) was transformed into a Poslanecká Sněmovna (Chamber of Deputies—lower house), while an upper house, the Senát (Senate), was to be elected at a later date. On 17 December a treaty pledging cordial relations and co-operation was signed, followed by the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two republics. At midnight on 31 December all federal structures were dissolved and the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic were officially established. The two republics were quickly recognized by the states that had maintained diplomatic relations with the CzSFR, as well as by those international bodies of which the CzSFR had been a member. Treaties and agreements to which the CzSFR had been a party were to be honoured by both republics.</p>

                         <heading>The Presidency of Václav Havel</heading>
                         <p>On 26 January 1993 the Chamber of Deputies elected Havel as the Czech Republic’s first President; the composition of the Government remained largely unchanged. Central banks for each state were established, and in February two separate currencies were introduced. In April 1994 the Chamber of Deputies adopted legislation permitting the restitution of property expropriated from Czech Jews during the Nazi occupation. Renewed controversy emerged in 1995 over the so-called lustration, or screening, law, which had been adopted by the Czechoslovak Federal Assembly in October 1991 and effectively banned former communist functionaries, as well as members of the former state security service, from holding senior political, economic and judicial posts; in October 1995 the Chamber of Deputies approved an extension of the lustration law until 2000.</p>
                         <p id="CZ.IS.27">The first general election since the dissolution of the CzSFR took place on 31 May and 1 June 1996. The ODS (which had merged with the KDS in April) won 68 of the 200 seats in the Chamber of Deputies (with 29.6% of the total votes cast), while the Česká Strana Sociálně Demokratická (ČSSD—Czech Social Democratic Party), under the leadership of Miloš Zeman, greatly increased its parliamentary representation, winning 61 seats (26.4%). The coalition of the ODS, the KDU-ČSL (which obtained 18 seats) and the ODA (13 seats) lost its overall majority, achieving a total of 99 seats. The KSČM and the Sdružení pro Republiku—Republikánská Strana Československa (Association for the Republic—Republican Party of Czechoslovakia) secured 22 and 18 seats, respectively. In July Klaus formed a new Government; in exchange for the ČSSD’s support of the minority administration, Zeman was appointed Chairman of the Chamber of Deputies. The ruling coalition held 52 of the 81 seats in the Senate following elections in November.</p>
                         <p id="CZ.IS.31">
            In November 1997 allegations of impropriety in the funding of the ODS led to the resignation of the Klaus administration, after the KDU-ČSL and the ODA withdrew from the coalition. Josef Tošovský, hitherto Governor of the Czech National Bank, was designated Prime Minister in December, and a new, interim Government was ap­pointed in January 1998; the four ODS ministers subsequently defected to the breakaway Unie Svobody (US—Freedom Union). Meanwhile, on 20 January Havel was narrowly re-elected to the presidency. In April the Czech Republic’s proposed membership of the 
            <xr pageref="Y" ref="NATO.IO">North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)</xr>
             was formally approved by the legislature.
          </p>
                         <p>Early elections to the Chamber of Deputies were held on 19-20 June 1998. The ČSSD retained its position (held since the earlier defection of the ODS deputies to the US) as the largest party in the Chamber of Deputies, winning 74 seats (with 32.3% of the votes cast), while the ODS secured 63 seats (with 27.7% of the votes). The KSČM, the KDU-ČSL and the US won 24, 20 and 19 seats, respectively. The rate of voter participation was 74%. Under an agreement signed between Zeman and Klaus in July, the ODS pledged not to support a motion expressing no confidence in a minority ČSSD government, in exchange for a number of senior parliamentary posts, including the chairmanship of the Chamber of Deputies (to which Klaus was later elected). On 17 July Zeman was appointed Prime Minister, and a new Council of Ministers was subsequently formed.</p>
                         <p>In July 1999 Ivo Svoboda was dismissed as Minister of Finance (in 2004 he was convicted of embezzlement and sentenced to five years’ imprisonment.) In September 1999 the Council of Ministers approved constitutional amendments, drafted by a joint ČSSD-ODS commission, which aimed to restrict presidential powers, including the right to appoint the Prime Minister and the heads of principal state institutions, and the right to grant amnesty. The Chamber of Deputies approved the changes in January 2000.</p>
                         <p>In April 2001 Vladimír Špidla, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, was elected unopposed to the chairmanship of the ČSSD, after Zeman agreed to relinquish the party leadership. In early 2002 the KDU-ČSL and US-DEU (formed by a merger of the US with a small party, the Demokratická Unie—Democratic Union) formed an electoral alliance, known as the Coalition. At elections to the Chamber of Deputies held on 14-15 June, the ČSSD was the most successful party (with 30.2% of the votes cast). President Havel invited Špidla to form a government, and on 9 July an agreement establishing a new administration was signed by the leaders of the ČSSD and the Coalition. A new, multi-party Government, headed by Špidla and dominated by the ČSSD, was approved by the Chamber of Deputies in August.</p>

                         <p>
            Prior to the expiry of Havel’s second term on 2 February 2003, voting took place in both legislative chambers to select a successor. Following several inconclusive rounds of voting, Klaus (who had relinquished the chairmanship of the ODS) was elected President on 28 February, defeating the candidate of the ruling coalition, Jan Sokol, with 142 of the 281 votes cast in both chambers. In October the Minister of Finance, Bohuslav Sobotka, was also appointed Deputy Prime Minister, with responsibility for implementing the public finance reform programme. At the end of June 2004 Špidla resigned as Prime Minister and as leader of the ČSSD, despite a vote of confidence in his party leadership. In the Czech Republic’s first elections to the European Parliament earlier in the month (following accession on 1 May to the 
            <xr pageref="Y" ref="WB02047.IO.TXT">European Union—EU</xr>
            ), the ČSSD had obtained only two of the 24 seats contested. In August Stanislav Gross, the acting leader of the ČSSD and hitherto the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior, formed a Government, which included six new ministers, and again comprised members of the KDU-ČSL and the US-DEU, as well as of the ČSSD.
          </p>
                         <p>Gross was elected as Chairman of the ČSSD in March 2005. At the end of that month the KDU-ČSL (which demanded Gross’s resignation, after allegations of financial impropriety) withdrew from the governing coalition, and the Government lost its majority in the Chamber of Deputies. Gross resigned on 25 April, and Klaus appointed the Minister of Regional Development and deputy leader of the ČSSD, Jiří Paroubek, as Prime Minister. The new, largely unchanged Council of Ministers (with the renewed participation of the KDU-ČSL) was confirmed in office on 13 May by the Chamber of Deputies. Gross resigned as ČSSD leader in September; he was succeeded by Paroubek in May 2006.</p>
                         <p>Elections to the Chamber of Deputies took place on 2-3 June 2006. The ODS won 81 of the 200 seats, with 35.4% of the votes cast; the ČSSD secured 74 seats, with 32.3% of the votes, the KSČM obtained 26 seats (12.8%), the KDU-ČSL 13 seats (7.2%) and the Strana Zelených (SZ—Green Party) six seats (6.3%). The rate of participation was 64%. The Chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolánek, was invited by Klaus to form a new administration. However, the ČSSD refused to support a proposed coalition between the ODS, the KDU-ČSL and the SZ, which narrowly failed to secure a parliamentary majority. In mid-August a member of the ČSSD, Miloslav Viček, was elected provisionally as Chairman of the Chamber of Deputies. Topolánek finally succeeded in forming a minority ODS-led administration, which was installed in early September. In early October, however, he resigned, after his Government lost a vote of confidence in the Chamber of Deputies. A new coalition administration, led by Topolánek and comprising members of the ODS, the KDU-ČSL and the SZ, was endorsed by a motion of confidence in the Chamber of Deputies on 19 January 2007. In August Topolánek narrowly succeeded in securing approval in the Chamber of Deputies for an extensive programme of fiscal reforms.</p>
                         <p>On 15 February 2008 Klaus, representing the ODS, was narrowly re-elected as President, defeating Jan Švejnar, who had been supported by the ČSSD. Klaus was inaugurated on 7 March. Elections to one-third of the seats in the Senate, conducted in two rounds in October, resulted in significant gains for the ČSSD, which secured 23 of the 81 seats, although the ODS remained the largest faction in the chamber, with 33 seats. On 26 March Topolánek’s Government submitted its resignation, following a motion of no confidence in the Chamber of Deputies. On 9 April President Klaus nominated Jan Fischer, a non-partisan candidate and hitherto the head of the Czech Statistical Office, as Prime Minister.</p>
                         <p>On 9 May 2009 a new Government, under Fischer, and comprising predominantly technocratic ministers nominated by the principal parties, was installed, with the intention that early legislative elections be held. At elections to the European Parliament on 5-6 June, the ODS secured nine seats, the ČSSD seven seats, the KSČM four seats, and the KDU-ČSL two seats; voter turnout was estimated at 28.2%. Also in June a former Chairman of the KDU-ČSL, Miroslav Kalousek, established a new conservative party, Tradice, Odpovědnost, Prosperita 09 (TOP 09—Tradition, Responsibility, Prosperity 09), headed by former Minister of Foreign Affairs Karel Schwarzenberg.</p>

                         <heading>Corruption Allegations</heading>
                         <p>In March 2010 Jan Dusík of the SZ resigned as Minister of the Environment, in protest against government proposals concerning the modernization of the Prunéřov coal-fired power station. The remaining SZ representative resigned later in March, after the party announced the withdrawal of support for the Government. Topalánek announced his resignation as Chairman of the ODS in April, after the publication of a controversial interview. At the end of that month the Chairman of the Chamber of Deputies, Miloslav Vlček of the ODS, also resigned, following allegations of the misuse of public funds.</p>
                         <p>At the elections to the Chamber of Deputies on 28-29 May 2010, the ČSSD obtained 22.1% of the votes and 56 seats, while the ODS was placed second, with 20.2% and 53 seats, followed by TOP 09 (16.7% and 41 seats) and the KSČM (11.3% and 26 seats). An anti-corruption party, Věci Veřejné (VV—Public Affairs), obtained 10.9% and 24 seats. The KDU-ČSL failed to secure representation in the chamber. In late May Paroubek resigned as Chairman of the ČSSD, acknowledging that the party would be unable to form a governing coalition, and was replaced in an interim capacity by Sobotka. On 28 June Klaus nominated Petr Nečas (who had been elected ODS Chairman earlier in the month) as Prime Minister. After an agreement was signed between the ODS, TOP 09 and VV, which together held 118 of the 200 legislative seats, a new coalition Government, headed by Nečas, was appointed on 13 July. Among the principal appointments was that of Schwarzenberg as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, and that of Radek John, the leader of VV, as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior.</p>
                         <p>Elections to one-third of the seats in the Senate were conducted in October 2010: the ČSSD, winning 12 of the 27 contested seats, obtained the highest representation in the chamber, with 41 seats overall, while the ODS won eight seats, its total representation falling to 25 seats. In April 2011 a former director of the police organized crime division, Jan Kubice, was appointed as Minister of the Interior. John resigned as Deputy Prime Minister in May, when he was re-elected as Chairman of VV. On 1 July VV representative Karolína Peake became Deputy Prime Minister (and Chairman of the Government Legislative Council).</p>
                         <p>On 14 December 2011 the Chamber of Deputies approved a constitutional amendment initiated by the Government providing for the introduction of direct elections to the presidency; this was endorsed by the Senate in February 2012, with effect from the end of Klaus’s mandate in 2013. After Vít Bárta, the leader of the VV parliamentary group, was found guilty, in April 2012, of bribery, Peake announced her resignation from VV, and the formation of a new parliamentary faction, which attracted a number of VV deputies, including the government members nominated by the party. A mass anti-Government demonstration was subsequently staged in Prague. On 22 April the ruling coalition was dissolved; the ODS and TOP 09 announced that they would co-operate with the former VV members. Five days later the reconstituted Government won a parliamentary vote of confidence. Peake’s faction was officially registered as a new political party, LIDEM—Liberální Demokraté (LIDEM—Liberal Democrats), in May and formed part of the ruling coalition.</p>
                         <p>In elections to one-third of the seats in the Senate, conducted on 12-13 October and 19-20 October 2012, the representation of the ODS declined by 10 seats to 15, while the ČSSD, remaining the largest faction, took 41 seats. At the end of October Jaromír Drábek of TOP 09 resigned as Minister of Labour and Social Affairs following revelations of corruption in the ministry, as a result of which the First Deputy Minister had been detained and charged. Following an agreement between Nečas and party dissenters, on 7 November the Government narrowly won a vote of confidence in the Chamber of Deputies that was linked to approval of tax increases. Also in December Nečas dismissed Peake as Minister of Defence, shortly after her appointment to the post, owing to administrative disagreements; she remained in the Government as Deputy Prime Minister.</p>

                         <heading>Directly Elected Presidency</heading>
                         <p>The country’s first direct election to the presidency was contested by nine candidates on 11-12 January 2013, with a second round on 25-26 January. The first-placed candidate in the second round of voting was former Prime Minister Zeman, with 54.8% of the votes cast, defeating Schwarzenberg. In early March, shortly before the expiry of his presidential term, the (ČSSD-dominated) Senate voted to impeach Klaus, on the grounds that he had violated the Constitution by granting an extensive amnesty to prisoners in January; the Constitutional Court subsequently dismissed the accusations of treason against Klaus. Zeman was inaugurated as President on 8 March.</p>
                         <p>On 17 June 2013 Nečas and his Government resigned, following the arrest of Nečas’s Chief of Staff and several other senior officials on charges of having abused the state security apparatus, allegedly to spy on several prominent figures, and of receiving bribes. A new, interim Government headed by former Minister of Finance Jiří Rusnok, principally comprising non-partisan technocrats, was appointed by President Zeman on 11 July. However, on 7 August the proposed administration lost a vote of confidence in the Chamber of Deputies. On 20 August the Chamber of Deputies voted in favour of its dissolution, and later that month Zeman scheduled pre-term elections.</p>
                         <p>The legislative elections, held on 25-26 October 2013, failed to produce a parliamentary majority: the ČSSD won 20.5% of the votes cast and 50 seats, followed by a liberal, anti-corruption party, Akce Nespokojených Občanů (ANO—Action of Dissatisfied Citizens—with 18.7% and 47 seats), the KSČM (14.9% and 33 seats), TOP 09 (12.0% and 26 seats), the ODS (7.7% and 16 seats), the new populist party Úsvit Přímé Demokracie (Dawn of Direct Democracy, 6.9% and 14 seats), and the KDU-ČSL (6.8% and 14 seats). Following lengthy negoti­ations between the ČSSD, ANO and the KDU-ČSL, a coalition agreement was signed in early January 2014. On 17 January Zeman designated ČSSD Chairman Sobotka as Prime Minister. A new administration headed by Sobotka, which included the leader of ANO, industrialist Andrej Babiš, as First Deputy Prime Minister, responsible for the Economy, and Minister of Finance, was approved by the Chamber of Deputies on 29 January.</p>
                         <p>In elections to the European Parliament, held on 23-24 May 2014, ANO secured 16.1% of the votes cast and four seats, followed by TOP 09 (together with Starostové a Nezávislí—STAN—Mayors and Independents), which secured 16.0% of the votes and four seats, and the ČSSD, with 14.2% and four seats. The KSČM took 11.0% of the votes and three seats, the KDU-ČSL 10.0% and three seats, the ODS 7.7% and two seats, and the Strana Svobodných Občanů (Free Citizens’ Party) 5.2% and one seat. The rate of participation by the electorate was 19.5%. Partial elections to the Senate were conducted on 10-11 and 17-18 October; the ruling ČSSD’s overall representation in the chamber declined to 29 seats, while the ODS held 14 seats.</p>

                         <heading>ANO Election Victory</heading>
                         <p>In May 2016 the Government approved a proposal (first presented by Zeman in 2013) that the country be referred to as `Czechia’ as an informal alternative to the `Czech Republic’ in foreign languages; the United Nations (UN) recognized the alternative name in July. Partial elections to the Senate, conducted on 7-8 October and 14-15 October 2016, demonstrated a further decline in support for the ČSSD, which henceforth held 19 seats in the chamber, compared with nine for the ODS and eight for the KDU-ČSL. </p>
                         <p>In early May 2017 Sobotka announced that he was to submit the resignation of his Government, in an effort to remove ANO leader Babiš from his position as First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, amid corruption allegations. However, after Zeman (who supported Babiš) indicated that he would retain all members of the Government, Sobotka decided to remain in office. Finally, on 24 May Babiš resigned as Minister of Finance, and ANO ally Ivan Pilný subsequently duly took office. Sobotka resigned as Chairman of the ČSSD in June. In early October Babiš (whose parliamentary immunity had been lifted in September) and ANO’s Deputy Chairman Jaroslav Faltýnek were formally charged with fraud involving the illegal acquisition of €2m. in EU subsidies by his business interests. (The charges against Faltýnek were dropped in March 2018.)</p>
                         <p>At legislative elections held on 20-21 October 2017, ANO was the first-placed party, with 29.6% of the votes and 78 seats (thereby ending the dominance of the traditional parties), followed by the ODS, with 11.3% of the votes and 25 seats. The pro-EU Pirátská Strana (Piráti—Pirate Party) obtained 10.8% and 22 seats, and the right-wing populist Svoboda a Přímá Demokracie (SPD—Freedom and Direct Democracy, established in 2015), with 10.6% and 22 seats, secured parliamentary representation for the first time. The KSČM won 7.8% of the votes and 15 seats, the ČSSD 7.3% and 15 seats (a decline of 35 seats compared with the previous elections, when it had been the leading party), the KDU-ČSL 5.8% and 10 seats, TOP 09 5.3% and seven seats, and a group of independents 5.2% and the remaining six seats. An official rate of participation by the electorate of 60.8% was recorded. Later that month Babiš announced his intention to form a minority government, owing to the refusal of the ODS and other principal parties to join a coalition administration while criminal investigations against him were under way.</p>
                         <p>Babiš officially assumed the office of Prime Minister on 6 December 2017. A new Government comprising members of ANO and independents was subsequently formed: Richard Brabec and Martin Stropnický, both of ANO, were appointed, respectively, as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Environment, and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs. The first round of the presidential election was contested by nine candidates on 12-13 January 2018: the incumbent President, Zeman, who favoured strong relations with the Russian Federation, secured 38.6% of the votes cast, while his main challenger, Jiří Drahoš, a former Chairman of the Czech Academy of Sciences, who supported the country’s commitment to the EU and NATO, received 26.6%. A rate of participation by the electorate of 61.9% was recorded. At the second round on 26-27 January, Zeman was narrowly elected to a second term of office with 51.4% of the votes cast. Voter turnout was high, at 66.6%.</p>
                         <p>Meanwhile, the new Government lost a delayed parliamentary vote of confidence, which took place on 16 January 2018. Babiš subsequently tendered the resignation of his administration; however, it remained in office in an interim capacity, after Zeman immediately granted him a new mandate. Shortly afterwards, the Chamber of Deputies voted to lift the parliamentary immunity of Babiš (which had been restored following the legislative elections), together with that of the ANO Deputy Chairman, Jaroslav Faltýnek. On 18 February former parliamentary speaker Jan Hamáček was elected as the new leader of the ČSSD. Zeman was inaugurated for a second term on 8 March; a protest against him in Prague took place a few days later. In March a campaign initiative, Milion Chvilek pro Demokracii (A Million Moments for Democracy), was launched to demand the resignation of Babiš, subsequently organizing regular protests.</p>

                         <p>On 27 June 2018 a new, minority Government, led by Babiš, and comprising members of ANO and the ČSSD, took office. Hamáček became First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior (following the ČSSD’s insistence that it hold the interior portfolio). After President Zeman refused to endorse the candidate nominated as Minister of Foreign Affairs (who had adopted a favourable stance towards EU migration quotas), Hamáček additionally assumed the post on an interim basis. An independent, Jan Kněžínek, was appointed as Minister of Justice on 10 July, after the resignation of the previous nominee, Taťána Malá, who was accused of plagiarism. The new Government, which was reliant on the legislative support of the KSČM, secured a vote of confidence on the following day. In mid-October Tomáš Petříček of the ČSSD was approved by Zeman as Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>
                         <p>
            Partial elections to the Senate, which were conducted, together with municipal elections, on 5-6 October 2018, with a second round on 12-13 October, reflected popular discontent with the ruling parties. 
            <!--https://www.volby.cz/pls/senat/se1214?xjazyk=EN&xdatum=0&xv=2-->
            The ODS secured 10 of the 27 contested seats, while ANO and the ČSSD each won only one seat, with the result that the opposition parties gained control of the chamber. However, ANO won the municipal polls in all regional capitals except Prague, where the ODS was placed first, and Liberec. Zdeněk Hřib, the leader of the ČPS, was elected Mayor of Prague by an opposition alliance in the City Assembly in November.
          </p>
                         <p>In November 2018 Babiš’s son, who had also been implicated in the corruption allegations involving his father’s business interests, claimed in a Czech television broadcast that he had been compelled to travel to the Russian-occupied territory of Crimea in order to prevent him from testifying against Babiš. The allegations, which were strongly denied by the Prime Minister, intensified public sentiment against him, and further demonstrations demanding his resignation took place in Prague later that month. On 23 November Babiš’s Government survived a parliamentary motion of no confidence, after ANO’s coalition partner, the ČSSD, abstained from voting. In a significant ruling in early February 2019, Babiš’s local Černošice council, near Prague, upheld a complaint by non-governmental organization Transparency International that he was in breach of conflict of interest regulations through his continued involvement with Agrofert, a conglomerate that he had wholly owned until 2017. Nevertheless, Babiš was re-elected unopposed as Chairman of ANO later that month.</p>
                         <p>After concluding an investigation into allegations of misuse of EU funds surrounding the Prime Minister, on 17 April 2019 the police recommended that Babiš be charged with fraud and referred the investigation to prosecutors. The following day Kněžínek resigned as Minister of Justice. In a government reorganization at the end of that month, Minister of Finance Alena Schillerová additionally became a Deputy Prime Minister. Karel Havlíček was appointed Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry and Trade, and Marie Benešová became Minister of Justice.</p>
                         <p>In elections to the European Parliament on 24-25 May 2019, ANO won 21.2% of the votes cast and six seats, ahead of the ODS, with 14.5% and four seats. The ČPS secured 14.0% of the votes and three seats, a coalition of TOP 09 and STAN won 11.7% and three seats, the SPD obtained 9.1% and two seats, the KDU-ČSL won 7.2% and two seats and the KSČM won 6.9% and one seat. Voter turnout was 28.7%, some 10 percentage points higher than that recorded in 2014.</p>

                         <heading>Anti-Government Protests</heading>
                         <p>Meanwhile, the appointment of Benešová, who was widely regarded as an ally of Babiš, prompted increasing public support for the protest movement in mid-2019. Protests were further fuelled by a local media report that a preliminary EU investigation had found Babiš to be in breach of rules on conflict of interest, owing to his ongoing links with former business concerns. A demonstration demanding that Babiš resign, organized in Prague on 23 June by Milion Chvilek pro Demokracii, was attended by some 250,000 protesters, constituting the largest protest rally held in the country since Czech independence. The campaign’s organizers additionally demanded the resignation of Benešová, and the end of subsidies and government contracts for Agrofert (ownership of which had been transferred from Babiš to a trust in 2017). Nevertheless, on 27 June Babiš survived a parliamentary vote of no confidence.</p>
                         <p>In mid-September 2019 Prague’s municipal prosecutor announced that the fraud investigation into Babiš’s business interests had been abandoned. A mass protest to demand the Prime Minister’s resignation, attended by 200,000-300,000 people, was held in central Prague on 16 November, the eve of the 30th anniversary of the Velvet Revolution. At the beginning of December Czech media outlets reported that a European Commission audit had confirmed that a potential conflict of interest remained between Babiš’s position as Prime Minister and his connections to Agrofert. Shortly afterwards, the Prosecutor-General overturned the decision announced in September, and stated that the fraud investigation in relation to Babiš was to continue. A further anti-Babiš protest was staged in Prague on 10 December.</p>
                         <p>In response to the emerging COVID-19 pandemic, on 12 March 2020 the Government declared a 30-day state of emergency, and restrictions on free movement were introduced four days later. Some restrictions on commercial activity and freedom of movement were eased during April. Amid a sharp resurgence in cases, in late September Adam Vojtěch was replaced as Minister of Health by epidemiologist Roman Prymula. One month later, however, Prymula was dismissed, after published photographs revealed that he had visited a restaurant, in apparent breach of the emergency COVID-19 restrictions imposed by the Government; he was succeeded by Dr Jan Blatný, an independent, on 29 October. A further 30-day state of emergency was declared with effect from 5 October. Meanwhile, a European Commission auditing review of 22 October confirmed that Prime Minister Babiš had breached domestic and EU conflict of interest legislation in connection with the contracts awarded to Agrofert. Blatný was dismissed as Minister of Health on 7 April 2021, following criticism by Babiš of his management of the pandemic, and his refusal to allow the use of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine, which had not been approved by the European Medicines Agency. He was replaced by Petr Arenberger, hitherto a hospital director. The state of emergency was progressively extended until 11 April, after which the easing of pandemic-related restrictions began. Minister of Foreign Affairs Tomáš Petříček was removed on 12 April, after he unsuccessfully challenged the ČSSD Chairman, first deputy premier Hamáček, for leadership of the party at its national congress. Jakub Kulhánek assumed the foreign affairs portfolio later in April. Arenberger resigned as health minister in late May amid allegations of financial misconduct, and Babiš reappointed Vojtěch, to the post.</p>
                         <p>Meanwhile, partial elections to the Senate were held on 2-3 October 2020, concurrently with polls to regional councils, with a second round on 9-10 October. Of the 27 seats contested, STAN won 11, the ODS five and the KDU-ČSL three. The rate of participation was 36.3% in the first round and 16.7% in the second. However, ANO retained support in the regional elections, securing 21.8% of the votes cast and 178 of the 675 seats, followed by the ODS, with 14.9% and 99 seats; the ČPS, with 13.3% of the votes, also increased its representation to 99 seats, and STAN, with 14.6%, took 91. In late October the ODS, the KDU-ČSL and TOP 09 formed an alliance, Spolu (Together), to contest the forthcoming legislative elections, with ODS leader Petr Fiala as its candidate for prime minister. In January 2021 an electoral alliance of STAN and the Piráti, Piráti a Starostové (Pirates and Mayors—PaS), was also established.</p>

                         <heading>Recent Developments: New Government of Petr Fiala</heading>
                         <p>The legislative elections held on 8-9 October 2021 produced a close result: the Spolu alliance received the most votes, with 27.8%, compared with 27.1% for ANO (which had been expected to win comfortably). ANO secured 72 seats (a loss of six compared with the 2017 elections), while Spolu’s 71 seats represented a gain of 29 seats compared with the performance of its three constituent parties in 2017. PaS won 15.6% of the votes and 37 seats (a gain of nine), while the SPD received 9.6% and 20 seats. Despite President Zeman’s stated commitment to invite the largest single party to form a government, there was little support from potential coalition partners for a second Babiš-led administration. Shortly after the publication of the results, Spolu and PaS agreed to begin coalition talks, and in mid-October Babiš announced that he would not attempt to form a government.</p>
                         <p>Meanwhile, on 10 October 2021 Zeman was admitted to intensive care in hospital. On 18 October Senate President Miloš Vystrčil announced that he had received information indicating that Zeman was unlikely to be able to exercise his official duties for several weeks, after which senators discussed invoking constitutional provisions relating to presidential incapacity that would enable the President’s duties temporarily to be redistributed. On 2 November Spolu and PaS announced the successful conclusion of coalition talks, with the proposed cabinet to be led by Fiala. Two days later, Zeman left intensive care and, although he remained hospitalized until late November, the process to transfer his powers was abandoned. Markéta Pekarová-Adamová, the leader of TOP 09, was elected to chair the new Chamber of Deputies on 10 November.</p>
                         <p>
            Zeman formally appointed Fiala as Prime Minister on 28 November 2021. Zeman initially rejected the nomination of Piráti’s Jan Lipavský to the foreign affairs portfolio, criticizing 
            <i>inter alia</i>
             his perceived inexperience. However, after Fiala refused to withdraw Lipavský’s nomination and reiterated his intention to seeking a ruling of the Constitutional Court on the matter, Zeman agreed to the appointment, and formally approved Fiala’s cabinet on 17 December. Other notable appointments included those of Zbyněk Stanjura, a longstanding ally of Fiala who had served in Nečas’ cabinet, as Minister of Finance, and STAN leader Vit Rakušan as First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior. The Government was confirmed in office after a confidence vote on 13 January 2022.
          </p>
                         <p>In June 2022 the Minister of Education, Youth and Sports and the Deputy President of STAN, Petr Gazdik, announced his resignation from both roles, after he was accused of links with organized crime. Vladimír Balaš, also of STAN, succeeded him as Minister of Education, Youth and Sports. The trial of Babiš on the longstanding charges of fraud in securing EU subsidies officially began on 12 September. Nevertheless, at the end of October Babiš announced that he would contest the forthcoming presidential election.</p>
                         <p>
            Partial elections to the Senate, held on 23-24 September 2022 (together with local elections), followed by a further round on 30 September-1 October, resulted in significant defeat for ANO in the second round. The constituent parties of the Spolu alliance, the ODS, the KDU-ČSL and TOP 09, won, respectively, eight, seven and three of the 27 contested seats, while ANO took only three seats. The official rate of participation was 42.7% in the first round and 19.4% in the second. 
            <!--https://www.expats.cz/czech-news/article/czech-local-election-results-to-be-official-on-tuesday https://www.volby.cz/pls/senat/se31?xjazyk=EN&xdatum=20220923&xv=1-->
            However, ANO made some gains in the municipal elections, taking 1,748 seats; overall the KDU-ČSL remained the first-placed party, with 3,252 seats, followed by the ODS (2,294). Meanwhile, on 3 September a cost of living crisis ensuing from the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February (see 
            <i>Other External Relations</i>
            ) prompted a rally attended by some 70,000 in Prague, at which demonstrators demanded the resignation of the Government and that the Czech Republic become militarily neutral. A further protest took place in late October.
          </p>
                         <p>On 9 January 2023 Babiš was acquitted of the charges of corruption relating to EU subsidies. In addition to Babiš, the leading presidential candidates to contest the forthcoming election were an economist and former university rector, Danuše Nerudová, and a retired army general (and a former Chairman of the NATO Military Committee), Petr Pavel, who were both independents supported by the Spolu alliance. On 13-14 January Pavel was placed first of eight candidates, winning 35.4% of the votes cast, narrowly ahead of Babiš, who obtained 35.0%, while Nerudová was third-placed, with 13.9%; a voter turnout of 68.2% was recorded. Pavel and Babiš proceeded to a second round on 27-28 January, when Pavel was elected to the presidency, with 58.3% of the votes cast and a record participation rate of 70.2%. He took office on 9 March.</p>

            Further anti-Government demonstrations were organized in Prague by a new populist party, Právo Respekt Odbornost (Law, Respect, Expertise), on 11 March and 16 April 2023. A larger package of economic austerity measures, proposed by the Government in May in response to a rapidly widening budget deficit, was signed into law by President Pavel on 22 November, following its approval by both parliamentary chambers. Opposition parties rejected the measures and announced plans to refer the issue to the Constitutional Court. On 27 November several labour unions organized mass protests and a one-day multi-sector strike in opposition to the government spending cuts, proposed changes to the pension system, the failure to raise salaries in the public sector and to continued high inflation; the strike action, which included the closure of most schools to demand higher funding for the education sector, was reported to be the largest since the establishment of the Czech Republic as an independent state.
          </p>
                         <p>The Government declared a day of national mourning after 14 people were killed and 25 were injured in a shooting by a student at the university in central Prague on 21 December. In early January 2024 opposition parties demanded the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Labour and Social Affairs Marian Jurečka, after it emerged that a Christmas party at his ministry had been held as planned despite the mass shooting earlier that day.</p>

            In 1997 the Government began to consider issues affecting the Roma population (unofficially estimated at some 300,000), after large numbers, claiming to have suffered persecution in the Czech Republic, attempted to obtain political asylum abroad. The Government established an interministerial commission for Roma community affairs in October. In early 1998 the Government formed a second commission, headed by Roma, to address issues affecting the Roma population, and a 40-year law restricting their nomadic way of life was revoked. In November 2007 the European Court of Human Rights found the Czech Republic to be in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights for educational discrimination against the Roma population, owing to the prevalence of Roma children in `special schools’ for children with learning disabilities. In response to the continued educational segregation of Roma children, in September 2014 the European Commission launched infringement proceedings against the Czech Republic.
            <!--http://www.amnestyusa.org/news/press-releases/czech-republic-eight-years-after-the-dh-judgement-a-comprehensive-desegregation-of-schools-must-take-->
            The Czech Government consequently adopted an expanded plan of reforms, which included the introduction of support measures for pupils identified as having special educational needs, a compulsory year of pre-school education for all pupils, and clear criteria to ensure that children with mild educational difficulties were provided for within mainstream education. Meanwhile, in October 2015 the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights urged the Government to adopt legislation to allow compensation to be provided to Roma women who had undergone sterilization without their consent. In July 2021 the Czech legislature finally ratified a law approving compensation payments to the Roma women concerned, but campaigners subsequently cited failings in the effective implementation of the scheme.

                         <p>In June 2023 the murder of a Roma man, which unconfirmed media reports indicated had been committed by a Ukrainian national, prompted Roma protests against the large number of Ukrainian refugees that had settled in the Czech Republic following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, amid increasing tensions between the two minority communities.</p>

Measures pro­viding for dual Czech-Slovakian citizenship became fully effective in October 1999, and in November an agreement on the division of former federal property between the Czech Republic and Slovakia was signed in Bratislava. The Czech Government consequently relieved Slovakia of its debts by buying the Czech National Bank’s claim for a symbolic one koruna. In May 2000 the two Governments signed an agreement that resolved the remaining issues associated with the division of jointly held assets.</p>

In December the two countries signed an agreement, whereby the plant would not operate at commercial capacity until its safety and environmental impact had been fully evaluated. In August 2001, however, the Czech authorities declared that a report issued by the European Commission demonstrated the safety of the plant and immediately commenced its reconnection with the national power network. Further safety issues were eventually agreed, and in April 2003 the Temelín installation began production at full capacity.</p>

            In December 2002 the Czech Republic was one of 10 nations formally invited to join the EU. A plebiscite on EU membership was held in the Czech Republic on 13-14 June 2003, and of the 55.2% of the electorate who took part, 77.3% voted in support of Czech membership. The Czech Republic became a full member on 1 May 2004. In December 2007 the Czech Republic implemented the EU’s Schengen Agreement, enabling its citizens to travel to and from other member states without border restrictions. Following the debt crisis in the eurozone, in early 2012 the Czech Republic refused to enter into the EU’s Treaty on Stability, Co-ordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union (the `fiscal compact’). In March 2014 the Government announced that it would sign the fiscal compact as a demonstration of commitment to EU integration, but a vote in the lower house was later deferred. After the Government led by Andrej Babiš supported the long-delayed adoption of the fiscal compact, it was ratified by the legislature in late 2018, and finally signed by President Zeman on 6 March 2019.

                         <p>In late 2015 an escalation in the number of refugees fleeing from civil conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic to Europe precipitated a crisis in transit states; in October the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights criticized the Czech authorities’ detention of refugees in poor conditions, and expressed concern at strong anti-immigration sentiments in the country. In May 2016 the Czech Government strongly opposed a new system of mandatory quotas for the redistribution of refugees proposed by the European Commission. On 7 December 2017 the European Commission formally referred the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) under infringement procedures for non-compliance with its relocation scheme. On 2 April 2020 the ECJ ruled that the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland had violated the law by refusing to fulfil their obligations under the EU’s migrant relocation scheme. The Czech Republic (together with several other European states) temporarily reintroduced border controls in early October 2023, in an effort to stem irregular migration and people smuggling.</p>

            In August 1993 the Czech Republic and Russia signed a treaty of friendship and co-operation (replacing the Russian-Czechoslovak treaty of 1992). In March 1999 the Czech Republic, together with Hungary and Poland, became a full member of the

                         <p>At a NATO summit meeting, which took place in Bucharest, Romania, in April 2008, member states endorsed US plans (which were strenuously opposed by Russia) to position missile defence bases in the Czech Republic and Poland. In July an accord providing for the installation of a US anti-missile radar system in the Czech Republic was officially signed in Prague. However, the US Administration announced in September 2009 that the plans for the deployment of part of a long-range missile defence system on Czech and Polish territory had been abandoned. In June 2011 the Czech Government announced the Czech Republic’s withdrawal from the USA’s revised defence plans, owing to dissatisfaction with the country’s downgraded participation. In March 2019 Prime Minister Babiš and other senior government ministers made an official visit to the USA, during which Babiš met US President Donald Trump in Washington, DC, USA. </p>
                         <p>Following Russia’s annexation of the Crimean peninsula in March 2014, the Czech Government stated that (unlike neighbouring states such as Poland) it was not in favour of NATO troops being permanently stationed in the country in response to subsequent conflict in parts of eastern Ukraine. The Czech Government supported the imposition of EU sanctions against Russia in March. However, President Zeman opposed the sanctions against Russia, and also attracted particular criticism for attending Victory Day celebrations (marking the 1945 surrender of Nazi German forces to the USSR) in the Russian capital, Moscow, on 9 May 2015. In April 2020 Russia denounced the removal of a statue of a controversial Soviet-era military commander in Prague, which followed the renaming of a square outside the Russian embassy after a murdered Russian opposition politician, Boris Nemtsov, in February. Relations deteriorated further in June, when the Czech Government expelled two Russian diplomats, amid claims that false information alleging a planned poison attack against the Mayor of Prague and two other municipal politicians had been passed to the Czech intelligence services by a Russian embassy employee. The Russian Government subsequently announced the retaliatory expulsion of two Czech diplomats.</p>
                         <p>The Czech Government strongly criticized Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, and supported the imposition of new wide-ranging EU sanctions against Russia. Notably, Zeman joined the criticism. On 16 March Prime Minister Fiala and his Polish and Slovenian counterparts were the first foreign leaders to visit the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, in a gesture of solidarity. In April the Czech Republic began to supply tanks to Ukraine, becoming the first NATO member state to do so. Following dissent over a planned EU ban on Russian crude oil imports, in a compromise agreement reached at the end of May, the Czech Republic (together with Hungary and Slovakia) was granted a temporary exemption from sanctions on Russian oil delivered by pipeline, owing to its high energy dependence on Russia. The Chamber of Deputies in mid-November adopted a resolution that recognized the regime in Russia as `terrorist’, in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and a series of intensified attacks targeting Ukrainian infrastructure. At the beginning of December both parliamentary chambers ratified legislation that permitted the training of up to 4,000 Ukrainian troops on Czech territory. After the financing of military support to Ukraine caused increasing budgetary strains, in October 2023 the Czech Ministry of Defence announced an agreement under which the Czech Republic and Denmark would jointly supply heavy military equipment, which would be provided by Czech defence companies and financed from the Danish budget. According to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, there were 375,590 Ukrainian refugees in the Czech Republic at the end of 2023. The Czech Government announced in November that it had frozen Russian state-owned property assets in the country, under an expanded national sanctions list.</p>

        <xr pageref="Y" ref="WB02047.IO.TXT">European Union (EU)</xr>
         criteria, legislation providing for a series of tax increases was introduced in January 2013 (subsequently reducing the budget deficit to 1%-2% of GDP). The economy, based on services and manufacturing, performed strongly in the second half of the 2010s, owing to stable access to EU funding, increased investment and private consumption. A small budgetary surplus was recorded annually in 2016-19, the rate of unemployment was reduced to the lowest in the EU, and government debt declined. Labour shortages continued to present the principal obstacle to growth, while also contributing to sharply rising wages. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 prompted the Government to announce fiscal rescue measures, comprising wage subsidies, tax concessions, and other support for employees and businesses affected by containment measures. GDP consequently contracted by 5.8% in that year, while the country recorded an elevated budget deficit. A modest recovery was recorded in 2021, with GDP growth of 3.3%. However, the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 precipitated an energy crisis and inflationary pressures in Europe, , and real GDP growth weakened to 2.5% in that year.

        Although rises in consumer price inflation began to slow during the second half of 2023, the cost of living crisis persisted. A large package of government austerity measures was approved in November, with the aim of reducing the widening budget deficit (which was estimated at 3.4% in 2023) over the following two years: in addition to spending cuts, value-added tax was to be restructured into two rates (12% and 21%) rather than the previous three, corporation tax and personal property tax were to be increased, and citizens were to pay higher taxes on medicine and alcoholic beverages. The new policy prompted protests and multi-sector strike action (see 
        <i>Domestic Political Affairs</i>
        ). According to the IMF, GDP declined by 0.2% in 2023, principally reflecting reduced household consumption, owing to declines in wages, in real terms, and low consumer confidence, although 
        
        positive GDP growth was forecast for 2024.
