          <heading>Introduction</heading>
          <p id="ESTONIA.ECONOMY.EDITED.P1">Estonia is located in north-eastern Europe and is one of the smallest member states of the European Union (EU), accounting for around 0.3% (1.35m.) of its population in 2023. As a small country with a complicated historical background, encompassing rapid political and economic reforms, and successful integration into global political and economic structures, Estonia provides a compelling case in terms of post-socialist transition and European (re)integration processes as well as the global context. Estonia has learned from its experiences before and during the Second World War and has been particularly active regarding its integration into global and regional institutional networks. With Latvia and Lithuania, it constitutes one of only three former Soviet republics to become member states of the EU from May 2004. Estonia joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1999, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 2004, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 2010, and became a member of the eurozone at the beginning of 2011. The World Bank classifies Estonia as a high-income economy—defined as a country with a gross national income (GNI) per head of at least US&#160;$12,476. In 2021 World Bank estimates indicated that the GNI of Estonia, at constant 2015 prices, was $28,370m., equivalent to $21,827 per head ($41,770 per head on an international purchasing-power parity—PPP—basis). Estonia has gradually improved its competitiveness and was ranked 22nd in the 2022 World Competitiveness Ranking by the International Institute for Management Development. For the ninth consecutive year, the US-based Tax Foundation declared that Estonia had the best tax code in the OECD, ranking the country first in its 2022 International Tax Competitiveness Index. This essay aims to examine the post-socialist reform process and recent economic developments in Estonia, emphasizing the process of convergence and integration in the context of European and global development.</p>

          <heading>Economic Policy Priorities during the Transition Process</heading>
          <p id="ESTONIA.ECONOMY.EDITED.P2">Radical reforms in Estonia started in 1987-88, with the debate between economists and politicians about the concept of economic autonomy known as Isemajandav Eesti (IME—Estonian Self-Sufficiency—the acronym meaning `miracle’ in Estonian). In 1990 economic autonomy, which had formerly been the priority, was replaced by the goal of political independence or the task of re-establishing independent statehood in Estonia. The new target for economic reforms became the restoration of a market economy. Estonia’s favourable location between East and West, the market economy experience it gained during the period of independence between the two World Wars (1918-40), and its historical and cultural traditions of co-operation with the well-developed countries around the Baltic Sea (especially with Finland), were critical initial conditions affecting the country’s economic development and speed of reforms.</p>
          <p id="ESTONIA.ECONOMY.EDITED.P3">After Estonia regained its independence in 1991, it was considered essential to launch economic reforms immediately. Since 1991 all Estonian governments have followed the principle that for the market to operate efficiently, firms and individuals need to have direct access to international markets, both as consumers and producers. Sustainable economic growth required external liberalization and the convertibility of currency. External liberalization in the Estonian case was combined with the core components of the transition to a market-based economy: price liberalization, stabilization, privatization, restructuring and institutional reform, and the introduction of hard budget constraints. Economic reform policy in Estonia had the following priorities: the early liberalization of prices and the gradual elimination of state subsidies; monetary reform and use of a currency board system; rapid privatization using the sale method; a conservative fiscal policy with a balanced state budget requirement; and an extremely liberal foreign trade regime.</p>
          <p id="ESTONIA.ECONOMY.EDITED.P4">The Estonian Government and the Bank of Estonia (Eesti Pank—the central bank) co-operated closely with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank during the preparation and execution of these economic reforms. Estonia liberalized open sector prices in 1991-92, and the monthly inflation rate declined from 20% in mid-1992 to below 0.3% in 1999. Annual inflation plummeted from near-hyperinflation in 1992, to 3%-4% in 1999. Another essential benchmark was the decision in June 1992 not to launch the Bank of Estonia as a traditional central bank, but as a currency board with certain traditional functions of a central bank. The Estonian kroon was pegged to the German Deutsche Mark at a rate of 8:1, which was maintained. After Germany implemented the single European currency, the euro, within the formation of the economic and monetary union (EMU), Estonia began to peg the kroon to the euro. This ended in 2011 when Estonia joined the eurozone.</p>
          <p id="ESTONIA.ECONOMY.EDITED.P5">Rapid privatization with active participation from strategic foreign investors has been one of the fundamental aspects of the successful transition in Estonia. The privatization process was drafted with strategic advice and support from the German Treuhandanstalt (Trust Agency). In contrast to most transition economies, privatization proceeded rapidly and without any excessive transfer of state-owned assets to insiders, resulting in substantial benefits. The final phase of privatization dismantled the long-held monopoly positions within several state-owned infrastructure sectors such as telecommunications, shipping, railways and energy. By the end of the 1990s the privatization of most state-owned enterprises had been completed in Estonia.</p>
          <p id="ESTONIA.ECONOMY.EDITED.P6">The liberalization of the foreign direct investment (FDI) regime was also very rapid in Estonia. The legal framework for FDI was set within the first few years after the country regained independence. The general provisions were very favourable to investors: national treatment was applied, and the full repatriation of profits was guaranteed. Since 2000, corporate income tax from investments has been abolished and firms need to pay such a tax only after having paid dividends. This contributed to the process of establishing Estonia as an attractive business location, and the country has subsequently been successful in attracting FDI.</p>
          <p id="ESTONIA.ECONOMY.EDITED.P7">Conservative fiscal policy has been another essential cornerstone of Estonian economic policy. The central bank is prohibited by law from extending credit to central and local governments, establishing an efficient institutional safeguard for ensuring that public sector finances remain balanced. According to Estonian law, the Riigikogu (State Assembly) is not allowed to pass an unbalanced state budget. Hence, the consolidated general government budget deficit has consistently been among the lowest in Europe. Consequently, the public-sector deficit has been very small, while public debt was equivalent to around 18.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2021, the lowest level among eurozone countries. The Government’s fiscal position was strengthened by an extensive reform of the public pension system in 2002, which moved Estonia from the public pay-as-you-go system to a three-tier, partly privately funded system.</p>
          <p id="ESTONIA.ECONOMY.EDITED.P8">Another cornerstone of Estonian economic policy is its orientation toward openness. The country’s foreign trade policy was distinct from that of other transition economies owing to the complete absence of tariffs and quantitative restrictions. This bold approach brought an unprecedented rapid reorientation of trade to the West. The share of the Russian Federation and other countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States in the Estonian export market dropped from 80% in the early 1990s to 4%-5% in the early 2000s. A fixed exchange rate, combined with a liberal trade regime, motivated domestic firms to improve their competitiveness in the world market. It was also highly valued by export-orientated foreign investors.</p>

          <heading>Economic Convergence during Three Crises</heading>
          <p id="ESTONIA.ECONOMY.EDITED.P9">After regaining independence, the primary aim of Estonia’s long-term economic policy framework was to catch up with industrialized EU member countries in terms of real income levels. In general, the Estonian catching-up process has been rapid: GDP per head (PPP-adjusted) rose from 34% of the EU-15 average in 1994 to 87% of the EU-27 average in 2021. However, owing to the small size and openness of the Estonian economy, it remains vulnerable to external shocks, and therefore the convergence process has been uneven.</p>
          <p id="ESTONIA.ECONOMY.EDITED.P10">By 2020 the Estonian economy had experienced three periods of crisis. In the early 1990s Estonia experienced a typical transitional crisis that was associated with the opening of foreign trade, rapid price liberalization and the privatization of state-owned firms. The second crisis occurred in late 1998 due to the Russian crisis, which brought about a massive devaluation of the Russian rouble. This reduced the competitiveness of Estonian goods on the Russian market and led to a decline in GDP in 1999. The recovery of the Estonian economy started in 2001, transforming into a period of economic expansion between 2004 and 2007, with average annual GDP growth of 8.2%, and a reduction in unemployment from 9.7% to 4.6%. The economic upturn resulted from a combination of several factors. In May 2004 Estonia joined the EU, which contributed to GDP growth through improved access to the EU market, increased activity by foreign investors, and access to EU structural funds. At the same time, it also created internal imbalances, which were caused by the expansion of lending by Nordic banks. The rise in Estonian domestic demand was the primary factor behind GDP growth, which was financed with the help of extremely rapid growth in private sector external debt. The ratio of total external debt to GDP in Estonia increased from 20% in 1999 to 108% by mid-2007, and this fuelled the real estate boom. In 2001-07 the internal market-orientated sectors that particularly benefited from the upturn, such as construction, wholesale and retail trade, and business services, significantly increased employment. Export-orientated sectors only moderately increased employment, due to their rapidly growing labour costs.</p>
          <p id="ESTONIA.ECONOMY.EDITED.P11">The third economic crisis in Estonia began in 2008 and was a combination of external factors arising from the global financial crisis and the existing internal imbalances. This resulted in declines in Estonia’s GDP of 5.0% in 2008 and 14.3% in 2009. The depth of the decline is comparable with the fall in the GDP of the USA during the Great Depression. Owing to the application of a currency board system, the role of monetary policy as an adjustment tool during the economic crises was very limited in Estonia. Hence, significant adjustments took place through the labour market, causing the employment rate of those aged between 20 and 64 years to decrease from 77.0% in 2008 to 66.7% in 2010, when the unemployment rate reached 16.7%. Within this business cycle, profound structural changes took place in the economy. The construction sector contracted sharply (its success having been linked with the real estate boom), as did several labour-intensive industries such as textiles, apparel and furniture. Therefore, labour market adjustments were highly sector-specific. The structural changes and intensive penetration of export markets engendered a strong recovery in the domestic economy. GDP growth was 7.5% in 2011 and 5.1% in 2012. A solid fiscal position also helped to restore financial market confidence.</p>

          <heading>The COVID-19 Crisis and Economic Recovery</heading>
          <p>The first case of COVID-19 infection in Estonia was detected on 28 February 2020. On 12 March a state of emergency was declared in the country, introducing medium-level quarantine requirements, which included the closure of schools (with a transfer to e-learning), shopping centres and leisure facilities. However industrial activities continued without interruption. Estonia benefited from a strong e-state, which made it possible to transfer operations to e-solutions relatively smoothly. A very large proportion of service providers in both the public and private sectors used distance working. The applied quarantine measures were successful and prevented a sharp deterioration in the public health situation. </p>
          <p>The Estonian Government reacted quickly to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 crisis. Additional funding of €1,140m. was approved, representing about 10% of the state budget. An Unemployment Insurance Fund was launched, providing for wage subsides (at a total cost of €250m.) to cover up to 70% of labour costs for firms in which turnover and the number of employees had decreased by at least 30% due to the pandemic. Additional measures worth €350m. were related to emergency guarantees for issuing new loans or relaxing repayment schedules offered by the state-owned financial institution KredEx. The third series of measures was linked to reductions in excise taxes, of 25% on diesel fuel, 7.1% on natural gas, and 3.1% on electricity.</p>
          <p>These measures as a whole helped Estonian companies very effectively, so that it was possible to prevent a rapid rise in unemployment. In the services sector, especially transport services and accommodation, however, employment declined sharply. Overall, the Estonian economy weathered the crisis surprisingly well in 2020. The total decline in annual GDP was 2.9%, which was one of the smallest contractions in the countries of the EU. The outcome was better than initially feared primarily because the restrictions introduced in Estonia to prevent the spread of COVID-19 cases were relatively loose. This was demonstrated above all by the performance of businesses focused on the domestic market. Second, the economic downturns in Estonia’s main trading partners (Finland, Sweden, Germany, Latvia and Lithuania) in 2020 were significantly smaller than expected and lower than in most other European countries, so that Estonia’s export companies were affected less severely. Third, the Estonian economy received strong support from the measures taken by the public sector, commercial banks and the central bank.</p>
          <p>The second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic affected Estonia much more seriously. In March 2021 new and aggressive waves of infection were recorded and stringent measures were again announced. However, the restrictions introduced in March to prevent the spread of COVID-19 cases had a surprisingly low impact on economic growth. In 2021 GDP recovered to record overall growth of 8.3%. Compared with 2019, the economy grew by 5.2%, exceeding pre-pandemic levels. Estonian exports performed well in 2021, increasing by 28% compared with 2020. The growth was driven by export-orientated manufacturing, as well as information and communication services, transportation and storage, and professional, scientific and technical activities. The accommodation and catering sector, which had been damaged in the pandemic crisis, continued to grow at a very rapid rate from a low level.</p>
          <p>Growth in domestic demand also contributed strongly to economic growth. As the restrictions blocked consumption spending in areas such as travel and entertainment, a larger part of income was retained as bank deposits than previously. Household deposits were some 17% larger in 2021 than in the previous year. Retail sales grew by more than 14%, representing one of the fastest rises in the EU. In addition, an important change in the Estonian pension system, which was implemented in 2021, contributed to the growth of domestic demand. The second pillar of the pension system, which was compulsory and consisted of payments from employees and the state, was restructured. From September it became voluntary, with three options: to continue payments, to invest independently or to withdraw money if personal income tax has been paid. The funds released from the second pension pillar were around €1,200m., or 4% of GDP, which gave a significant stimulus to domestic demand. About 150,000 people withdrew their savings, and according to the different surveys, around one-half of this was used for consumption.</p>

          <heading>Estonia at the Forefront in Implementing e-Solutions</heading>
          <p id="ESTONIA.ECONOMY.EDITED.P19">The COVID-19 crisis has shown how important it is for a country to be able to deploy different e-government solutions. Estonia has been at the forefront of efforts to adapt and drive further the ICT paradigm in the economic, technological and sociopolitical sense. The Estonian Government is probably the most connected online globally, having introduced effective new ways of delivering services. Estonia is known as one of the leading developers and adopters of various e-government services, which range from e-voting to the e-tax office, e-health and e-schools. For example, the use of an electronic tax office now dominates: in 2023 around 99% of all tax declarations will be submitted online.</p>
          <p id="ESTONIA.ECONOMY.EDITED.P20">Furthermore, Estonia is one of the leading experimenters and proactive developers of radically new technological solutions. The digital society in Estonia is made possible largely owing to its infrastructure. Instead of developing a single, central system, Estonia created an open, decentralized system, linking various services and databases. Estonia’s most recent innovations, including e-residency and digital embassy projects, may redefine many existing sociopolitical institutional aspects, such as the meaning of the state, citizens, politics and public services. Estonia offers an interesting and globally unique test-bed for other countries. The most radical innovation was launching the Estonian virtual residency programme in December 2014, which by 19 May 2023 had attracted more than 100,000 members from 170 countries. Those approved for e-residency receive a government-issued ID card, which provides access to the same secured internet services available to Estonian citizens. For example, it allows them to sign documents online, without having to visit Estonia, enabling them to open a company entirely online and manage EU business remotely. Over 25,000 companies have been opened using e-residency. </p>
          <p id="ESTONIA.ECONOMY.EDITED.P21">In 2007 Estonia was among the first countries to experience a cyber attack during a dispute with Russia over the transfer of a Second World War memorial from the centre of Tallinn, the Estonian capital, to the Estonian Defence Forces cemetery outside the city. It demonstrated for the first time the potential vulnerability of any NATO country to disruption of its ICT systems. In response to this cyber attack, the NATO Co-operative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence was established in Tallinn in 2008. Estonia has been an active proponent of the Digital Single Market in Europe. During its presidency of the Council of the EU in the second half of 2017, Estonia initiated negotiations to support a digital and competitive European Single Market, prioritizing the free movement of data as the fifth freedom within the EU. During its EU presidency, Estonia achieved two significant successes: the liberalization of geo-blocking (restricting online access to users based on their geographical location) and of cross-border parcel delivery. </p>
          <p>
      Estonia has a very dynamic start-up society. In the first quarter of 2023, according to the Estonian Startup Database, Estonia hosted 1,461 business start-ups, including 14 new start-ups created in 2023. In 2022 the Estonian start-up system recorded substantial achievements. Financial technology (fintech) start-up Wise became the first Estonian `decacorn’ (with a valuation of more than US $10,000m.), while investments in Estonian start-ups more than doubled compared with 2021 and the turnover of start-ups grew by 46%. The largest sector in terms of active start-ups is business software (17% of all start-ups), followed by fintech (13%) and consumer products and services (11%). The largest employers among start-ups were Wise (1,890 employees), Bolt (1,285), Swappie (443), Veriff (343) and Monese (249). Veriff in January 2022 and Glia in M
      
      arch became the next Estonian `unicorns’ (with a value exceeding $1,000m.), further strengthening Estonia’s position as the leading country in Europe in terms of the number of unicorns per capita. Estonia has raised the most investment per capita (€1,967) of any country in Europe. In terms of start-ups created per million inhabitants, Estonia was first-placed globally with 1,107 start-ups, followed by Israel (1,070 start-ups) and Singapore (650 start-ups). With the aim of boosting the emergence and growth of Deep Tech teams in Estonia working with innovative technologies, the Startup Estonia government initiative and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Information Technology have prepared an action plan to develop research- and technology-intensive start-up entrepreneurship, and aim to establish a centre of excellence for deep technology start-ups.

          <heading>Consequences of the War in Ukraine</heading>
          <p>The war in Ukraine, which began following Russia’s invasion on 24 February 2022, has adversely affected the Estonian economy due to the impact on trade flows, both directly through Estonian trade, and indirectly through the disruptions to Estonia’s trading partners. In 2021 Russia, Belarus and Ukraine together accounted for around 5% of Estonian exports and provided 16% of imports. Russia alone accounted for 4.2% of Estonian exports and 10.5% of imports. The principal goods that were exported to Russia were machinery, mechanical and electronic equipment and devices, and chemical products and plastics. The main exports to Ukraine were machinery and equipment, fish and fish products, and chemical products, and the main exports to Belarus were cocoa and cocoa products, machinery and equipment. Mineral fuels from Russia and Belarus, mainly imported as transit goods, have constituted a large part of imports, and a smaller share was used for domestic consumption. Around one-third of imports were raw materials for manufacturing—timber and metals.</p>
          <p>The consequences of wide-ranging EU sanctions imposed against Russia and Belarus following the invasion of Ukraine for Estonia’s trade with Russia have been most serious. In the first quarter of 2023 Estonia imported goods from Russia with a value of only €41m., compared with imports of €613m. during the first quarter of 2022, representing their near cessation. A similar drastic reduction in Belarusian imports was also recorded. However, surprisingly, Estonia’s exports to Russia were unaffected, amounting to €171m. in the first quarter of 2023, a year-on-year rise of 7%. Although Russia, Belarus and Ukraine were not major Estonian trading partners, the interruption to trade with those countries still substantially affected the transportation and storage, wood-processing, metal-production, machine-building and chemical-production sectors. According to calculations by the Bank of Estonia, the sharp reduction in trade with Russia, Belarus and Ukraine could reduce the GDP of Estonia by around 1.2%. </p>
          <p>Another broader consequence of the war was the end of supplies of natural gas from Russia. The gas markets of the Baltic states and Finland had the alternative option of liquefied natural gas (LNG) supplies through the port of Klaipėda in Lithuania, but transmission capacity covered only around two-thirds of demand for the whole region. Therefore, the construction of strategically important LNG terminals began in parallel in the Estonian port city Paldiski and in the Finnish port Inkoo. Both projects were completed by the end of 2022. These steps together allowed the Baltic region to become independent of Russian gas imports.</p>

          <heading>Multiple Economic Crises</heading>
          <p>Estonia suffered multiple crises in 2022. The energy deficit caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine also accelerated price rises of many other commodities. Consumer price increases, as well as the rising interest rates of the European Central Bank, started to suppress economic growth. In early 2022 Estonia had the highest inflation rate among the eurozone countries. The rapid price increases in Estonia ended in August when energy and other commodity prices peaked. However, the growth of core inflation has not yet stopped and is expected to subside only in the second half of 2023.</p>
          <p>Consumer confidence, exports and government support sustained the Estonian economy in the first half of 2022. During the second half of 2022, however, consumer confidence and export competitiveness deteriorated and the economy contracted by 4.4% in the fourth quarter compared with the same period of the previous year. However, this calculation of the real economy is also partly related to inflation measurement problems. The nominal growth of the economy is very strong, amounting to 12% in the fourth quarter of 2022. A wide gap between nominal and real GDP figures represents continuing high inflation. Preliminary GDP figures in Estonia have historically underestimated real economic growth; thus, it remains likely that the figures for 2022 could be revised upward.</p>
          <p>In 2022 overall GDP decreased by 1.3%. The most significant positive contributor was accommodation and food service activities, which had recovered from the pandemic crisis. The sectors significantly contributing to the contraction in GDP were real estate activities, energy, trade, agriculture and financial activities. Private consumption grew by 2.6% in 2022, while government consumption remained at the 2021 level. Investments fell by 10.9% in 2022 overall. The growth rate of exports (5.0%) was quite similar to that of imports (5.8%).</p>
          <!--Repeated verbatim in final para of Conclusion-->
          <p>The new Government established in April 2023 is focused on improving public finances. Parliamentary elections in early March resulted in an overwhelming victory for centrist parties. The new three-party governing coalition plans to improve the state of public finances by raising value-added tax and corporate and personal income tax by 2%. The Government also intends to introduce a car tax, with Estonia being hitherto the only EU member state without such a tax. These changes will slow the recovery in household consumption, but help to narrow the widening gap between tax revenues and budget expenditures.</p>

          <heading>Conclusion</heading>
          <p id="ESTONIA.ECONOMY.EDITED.P23">Estonia provides an example of a country that has gone through a complicated socioeconomic transition process and managed to integrate into global and regional institutional networks (such as the WTO, the OECD, NATO and the EU). Estonia has followed a highly liberal foreign trade regime and policy towards FDI, combined with a conservative fiscal policy and low external debt in the public sector. Successive governments have created a solid basis for fulfilling the primary macroeconomic objective of the Estonian economy—catching up with the income levels of highly industrialized countries. Estonia has succeeded in increasing its GDP substantially. It seeks ways to gain from the EU integration process by finding a high value-added niche in the European and global division of labour, taking into account its favourable location in the Baltic Sea region. However, owing to Estonia’s small size and the openness of the economy, it is highly vulnerable to external shocks; therefore, the convergence process has been uneven.</p>
          <p id="ESTONIA.ECONOMY.EDITED.P24">The global economic crisis beginning in 2008 affected Estonia significantly because the external factors arising from the financial crisis were aggravated by the real estate `bubble’ fuelled by the lending boom of Nordic banks. This combination of factors resulted in a severe decline in GDP in 2008-09. The openness of Estonia’s economy and a relatively flexible labour market created an environment for a healthy recovery, which was assisted by the general improvement in the external environment. The Estonian economy entered the COVID-19 crisis in good shape. Unemployment was 4.4% in 2019 and household finances were sound, while the state budget was balanced and public debt was at the lowest level among OECD members. Credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor’s upgraded its rating for Estonia in February 2020 to AA- with a positive outlook. Hence, Estonia had excellent access to external financing at the outset of the crisis. In addition, Estonia benefited from a strong e-state, which facilitated the relatively easy transfer of economic activities to e-solutions.</p>
          <p>The Estonian economy weathered the COVID-19 crisis surprisingly well. The decline in GDP for 2020 overall was 2.9%, which was less than initially feared and one of the smallest contractions in the countries of the EU. This was due to a number of reasons: moderate government action against the pandemic, the robust state of major trading partners’ economies and the ability to implement a variety of e-solutions quickly. In 2021 overall the Estonian economy grew by 8.3% and compared with 2019 the economy grew by 5.2%, exceeding pre-pandemic levels.</p>
          <p>
      However, the immediate economic outlook is not so favourable. The energy crisis caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine precipitated rapid price rises of many other commodities, which contributed to depressing economic growth. 
      <!--repeating above-->
      As a consequence, GDP contracted by 1.3% in 2022 overall. According to the main forecasts of the Estonian Central Bank, the downturn in the Estonian economy will be fairly small in 2023, when real GDP is projected to decrease by 0.5%. Economic growth is expected to recover year on year during the second half of 2023, and GDP growth of 2.5% is anticipated in 2024, benefiting from accumulated buffers and a strong labour market. The number of employed people has reached a record high and the unemployment rate fell from 6.2% in 2021 to 5.6% in 2022.
