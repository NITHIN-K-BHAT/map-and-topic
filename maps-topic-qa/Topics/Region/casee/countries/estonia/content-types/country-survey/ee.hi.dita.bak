          <heading>Early History</heading>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P1">
      The Estonians were subjugated by the German crusading order, the Sword Brethren, and the Danes in the 13th century. In the 16th century the Lutheran reformation and internal divisions fatally weakened German colonial rule and laid the region open to covetous neighbours. A series of protracted wars beginning in 1558, involving the Swedes, Danes, Russians and Poles, left most of the north-eastern Baltic area under Swedish rule from 1629. Although Estonia and the northern half of Livonia, the territory inhabited by the Estonians, were conquered by Russia in 1710, the Baltic German landowning nobility retained its political, social and economic hegemony under the Russian Empire. The Estonian peasants were emancipated from serfdom in 1816-19. However, it was only as a result of the series of agrarian reforms that began in 1849 and continued into the 1860s that a native Estonian property-owning class came into existence. This development laid the basis for an Estonian cultural revival, some of the most significant events of which were the publication of a national epic, 
      <i>Kalevipoeg</i>
      , in 1857, and a nationwide song festival in 1869. Demands for national autonomy were first made during the failed Russian revolution of 1905.

          <heading>Independent Estonia</heading>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P2">The unexpected collapse of both the Russian and German empires in 1917-18 provided the nations of the eastern Baltic with the opportunity to establish their own sovereign states. After the overthrow of the Russian Tsar, Nicholas (Nikolai) II, in March 1917, Estonia became a single, autonomous administrative unit for the first time. Estonians elected an assembly (Maanõukogu), which vied for control with the Bolshevik-dominated soviets (councils). The Bolshevik seizure of power, which resulted in civil war throughout the Russian empire, and the threat of German military occupation impelled Estonian national leaders to act. The Eesti Päästekomitee (Estonian Salvation Committee), appointed by the Maanõukogu, and comprising the major political parties, declared independence on 24 February 1918. As the Bolsheviks abandoned Estonia, German forces advanced and occupied the country. The Estonian Provisional Government, headed by Konstantin Päts, re-established control in November after Germany capitulated. However, independence was secured only after Estonian forces repelled an invasion by the Bolshevik Red Army. A peace accord with Soviet Russia, the Treaty of Tartu (Dorpat), was signed on 2 February 1920, under which Russia recognized Estonian independence in perpetuity. International recognition came in the following year, with Estonia’s admission to the League of Nations in September 1921.</p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P3">Two noteworthy achievements of the Republic of Estonia were the land reform of 1919, which expropriated the large estates of the ethnic German `Baltic barons’ and distributed the land among the peasants, and the 1925 law on cultural autonomy for ethnic minorities, generally recognized as one of the most liberal provisions regarding minorities in the world at the time. For most of its existence between the First and Second World Wars the country was a liberal democracy, but from 1934-40 it came under moderate authoritarian rule. The 1920 Constitution concentrated power in the legislature, the Riigikogu (State Assembly), at the expense of the relatively weak executive. In 1933 a right-wing, populist movement, the Eesti Vabadussõjalaste Keskliit (Vaps—War of Independence Veterans’ League), succeeded in winning popular support in a referendum for the amendment of the Constitution to introduce a strong presidency. In order to prevent a potential electoral victory of the radical right, on 12 March 1934 the premier and acting President, Konstantin Päts, and Gen. Johan Laidoner (who became Commander-in-Chief of the Army) imposed martial law and suspended the State Assembly. In 1938 Päts legitimized his rule by introducing a new Constitution, which provided for a presidential system of government, with a bicameral legislature. In April he was elected President. Although the Päts regime restricted civil liberties and established corporatist institutions, it allowed limited pluralism and enjoyed substantial popular support, especially in rural areas.</p>

          <heading>Soviet Occupation</heading>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P4">Following the Nazi-Soviet Treaty of Non-Aggression of 23 August 1939, which divided Eastern Europe into `spheres of influence’, Estonia was confronted with a Soviet ultimatum to conclude a Treaty of Mutual Assistance. Estonia complied on 28 September and was forced to grant the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) military bases on its territory. The sudden resettlement to Germany of virtually the entire Baltic German community in the final months of 1939 ominously hinted at what lay ahead. On 16 June 1940, while the German army conquered France, the USSR issued another ultimatum demanding the formation of a pro-Soviet government and the entry of the Red Army into Estonia. The Estonian Government capitulated to these demands. A pro-Soviet Government under Johannes Vares-Barbarus, chosen by the special emissary of Stalin (Iosif Dzhugashvili), Andrei Zhdanov, was installed, single-party elections were held, and on 6 August Estonia was formally incorporated into the USSR as a Union Republic (Soviet Socialist Republic—SSR).</p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P5">
      The new regime proceeded with the rapid `sovietization’ of political, cultural and economic life in Estonia. Leading members of religious, military, educational, political and administrative institutions were arrested and deported, with a significant number executed. The `era of Soviet terror’ was interrupted by Nazi German occupation from 1941 to 1944. During the Second World War the Soviet and German armies in turn mobilized Estonian men into their ranks. An Estonian provisional Government sought to restore independence in September 1944, as the German forces retreated, but was immediately suppressed by the advancing Red Army. The Soviet reoccupation was resisted into the early 1950s by small bands of pro-independence guerrillas known as the `forest brethren’ (
      <i>metsavennad</i>
      ). Approximately 70,000 Estonians fled the country to escape the returning Red Army.
    </p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P6">To administer the Estonian SSR, the Soviets installed russified Estonians to head the Eestimaa Kommunistlik Partei (EKP—Communist Party of Estonia) and other important state institutions. Collectivization of agriculture was carried out in 1947-49, accompanied by the deportation of over 20,000 people, most of whom were women and children. Perhaps the most lasting consequence of Soviet rule was a drastic demographic shift: at the end of the Second World War over 90% of the population were ethnically Estonian, but by 1989 the Estonian proportion of the population had decreased to 61.5%. Estonia’s high standards of living, compared with the rest of the USSR, and the Soviet policy of developing heavy industry, particularly in north-eastern Estonia, contributed to a massive influx of Russians and other Slavs. To Estonians this appeared to be part of an intentional policy of assimilation. Thus, concern for ethnic survival was one of the primary factors in the drive for independence in the late 1980s.</p>

          <heading>Restoration of Independence</heading>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P7">The policies of glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring) advocated by the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, from the mid-1980s were seized upon by Estonians to challenge the Soviet system. The first mass protests took place in early 1987, against a planned phosphate mining project, which would have devastated the environment. This led in September to a proposal by four Estonian economists for economic self-management, the first republican attempt to gain more autonomy from the all-Union authorities. At the Plenary Conference of the Creative Unions, held in April 1988, the nation’s intellectual elite directly criticized the leadership of the EKP. The pro-reformist Rahvarinne (Estonian Popular Front) was established on 13 April, an initiative soon replicated in other Soviet republics.</p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P8">The critical moment of national self-assertion, known as the `singing revolution’, occurred in mid-1988, a period of mass protest gatherings at the song festival grounds, where the national tricolour was openly displayed. On 16 June the EKP First Secretary, Karl Vaino, was replaced by a Gorbachev protégé, Vaino Väljas, the first native Estonian to lead the EKP since the 1940s. Responding to pressure from Rahvarinne, the Estonian Supreme Soviet (Supreme Council) adopted a declaration of sovereignty on 16 November 1988, an act soon followed by other Union Republics. On 18 January 1989 Estonian was declared the state language. The Rahvarinne developed close links with popular fronts in the other Baltic republics of Latvia and Lithuania. This co-operation was most spectacularly illustrated by the 620-km human chain formed from Tallinn to Vilnius, Lithuania, on 23 August, to protest against the Nazi-Soviet Pact, which had assigned Estonia to the Soviet `sphere of influence’, on its 50th anniversary.</p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P9">The Rahvarinne’s strategy of reform from within the system was challenged by a `grass roots’ movement, known as the Citizens’ Committees, which sought to restore the independent republic that had existed between the First and Second World Wars, on the basis of legal continuity. The Committees circumvented the `illegal’ institutional structures of the Soviet republic by successfully registering the great majority of Estonian citizens (according to pre-1940 criteria) and holding elections on 24 February 1990 to a Congress of Estonia, which claimed to represent the will of the Estonian citizenry. The impact of the Congress, however, was lessened by the victory of the Rahvarinne in elections to the Estonian Supreme Council (Supreme Soviet), held on 18 March. Edgar Savisaar, the leader of the Rahvarinne, was elected Chairman of the Council of Ministers (Prime Minister).</p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P10">On 30 March 1990 the Estonian Supreme Council declared a period of transition to independence. The Estonian Government began to create new state institutions, such as border guards and the Bank of Estonia. In May Gorbachev declared measures towards independence null, following the restoration of independent Estonia’s name, flag and anthem. However, amid the Soviet military crackdown in Lithuania in January 1991, Boris Yeltsin, the Chairman of the Russian Supreme Soviet, signed an agreement recognizing Estonian sovereignty. A referendum on independence was held on 3 March, with almost 78% of voters responding favourably.</p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P11">On 20 August 1991, in response to the attempted coup by the hardline communists of the `State Committee for the State of Emergency’ in the Russian and Soviet capital, Moscow, the Estonian Supreme Council declared immediate independence. Soviet troops seized the television tower outside Tallinn, but withdrew as the coup foundered. The new Soviet State Council recognized Estonian independence on 6 September, and on 17 September Estonia was admitted to the United Nations (UN).</p>

          <heading>Domestic Politics</heading>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P12">A deterioration in the economic situation, caused by the collapse of the Soviet system, resulted in Savisaar’s resignation on 30 January 1992. He was replaced by Tiit Vähi, who formed a technocratic, transitional cabinet. The new Government’s main achievement was the introduction, against prevailing Western advice, of a convertible Estonian currency, the kroon (crown), which was `pegged’ to the German currency, the Deutsche Mark. This measure laid the basis for Estonia’s economic recovery.</p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P13">A Constituent Assembly, with delegates provided by both the Supreme Council and the Congress of Estonia, drew up a Constitution, which, after approval in a referendum, came into force on 3 July 1992. The Constitution provided for a 101-member State Assembly and a presidency with limited powers. In the first legislative elections, held on 20 September, the Isamaaliit (Pro Patria Union), led by 32-year-old historian Mart Laar, obtained the largest number of seats, and formed a coalition Government with the Eesti Rahvusliku Sõltumatuse Partei (Estonian National Independence Party) and the Erakond Mõõdukad (Moderates). In the concurrent direct presidential election, Arnold Rüütel, previously Chairman of the Supreme Council, won 42% of the votes cast, but not the required absolute majority. In a second round of voting, the State Assembly elected the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lennart Meri, to the presidency.</p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P14">Laar’s Government embarked on a radical policy of transition to a free market economic system, which won plaudits from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), but was denounced by many farmers and pensioners. Following a series of scandals and defections from his own party, Laar was forced to resign, and was replaced in October 1994 by Andres Tarand, a member of the Erakond Mõõdukad.</p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P15">The second post-independence elections were held on 5 March 1995. The largest number of seats in the legislature (41 of the total of 101) was won by an alliance of former premier Vähi’s Eesti Koonderakond (Estonian Coalition Party) and the Eesti Maarahva Erakond (EME—Estonian Rural Union—comprising various agrarian parties and led by Rüütel). Vähi formed a Government, which was supported by the EME and the Eesti Keskerakond (EK—Estonian Centre Party) headed by Savisaar. Following the collapse of the Government in October, Vähi formed a new coalition, which included the pro-business Eesti Reformierakond (ER—Estonian Reform Party), led by Siim Kallas, the former Governor of the Central Bank. </p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P17">In the presidential election of 1996, Meri again defeated Rüütel. Vähi formed a new Government without the ER in December, but was forced to resign in February 1997 owing to allegations of abuse of office. A new cabinet was installed under the leadership of former broadcaster Mart Siimann, also of the Eesti Koonderakond. At legislative elections in March 1999 the EK won the largest number of seats, but was unable to form a majority coalition, and Laar and his Isamaaliit established a centre-right coalition Government with the ER and the social-democratic Erakond Mõõdukad. The Laar Government strove to complete infrastructure privatization, with the two principal sectors being those of energy and transport. However, complex privatization deals were mismanaged, resulting in the erosion of the Government’s popularity. The Government was irreparably damaged by the outcome of the presidential election of August-September 2001, in which two of the governing parties, the Isamaaliit and the ER, each believed that they possessed the strongest candidate. Their failure to support a compromise candidate ultimately led to the unexpected victory of the perennial runner-up, Rüütel, who had been widely discounted as a relic of the past. The governing coalition subsequently began to weaken, and on 8 January 2002 Laar resigned, claiming that he had been betrayed by the ER, which had ousted the Isamaaliit from the Tallinn City Government and had formed an alliance with the rival EK.</p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P18">A new governing coalition was established on 22 January 2002 by the ER and the EK. The new Government was headed by Kallas of the ER, Minister of Finance in the Laar Government, although the EK held eight of the cabinet’s 14 portfolios. This coalition of ideological opposites proved remarkably cohesive. In the parliamentary elections of March 2003, both the governing parties not only maintained their popularity, but even slightly increased their share of the vote. Although Savisaar’s EK won the most votes (25.4%), a new, populist centre-right party, the Ühendus Vabariigi eest Res Publica (Res Publica—Union for the Republic Res Publica), received an equal number of seats (28) in the State Assembly. Res Publica championed not only law and order and the fight against corruption, but also internal party democracy and transparency. Its leader, Juhan Parts, was sworn in as Prime Minister on 10 April, leading a coalition that included the ER and the Eestimaa Rahvaliit (Estonian People’s Union—formed by the merger of the EME and two smaller parties), which represented the rural population.</p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P19">The Parts Government, widely regarded as young and inexperienced, remained in office for two years, its main achievements being a reduction in the uniform rate of income tax from 26% to 24% and a substantial increase in financial support for those on maternity leave. A new administration, headed by Andrus Ansip, the Mayor of Tartu, who had assumed the leadership of the ER after Kallas’s departure for the European Commission, was sworn in on 13 April 2005; the EK replaced Res Publica in the governing coalition. The Ansip Government benefited from Estonia’s thriving economy and expanding government revenue. At the local elections held in October, the EK strengthened its position, becoming the first group to succeed in forming a single-party city administration in Tallinn. A weakened Res Publica survived by merging with the Isamaaliit to form the Isamaa ja Res Publica Liit (IRL—Union of Pro Patria and Res Publica) in mid-2006.</p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P20">In the presidential election of 2006, Toomas Hendrik Ilves of the Sotsiaaldemokraatlik Erakond (SDE—Estonian Social Democratic Party—as the Rahvaerakond Mõõdukad—Peoples’ Party Moderates, itself the successor to the Erakond Mõõdukad, had been renamed) defeated Rüütel, the incumbent, by a narrow majority in the electoral college on 23 September.</p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P21">In the elections to the State Assembly on 4 March 2007, the two main governing parties both increased their share of the votes cast, although the ER, with 27.8%, managed narrowly to defeat the EK, which secured 26.1%. For the first time, a governing party won the parliamentary elections and the same Prime Minister continued in office. Ansip, however, decided to end the existing coalition and form a new Government with the IRL, an ideologically closer partner than the EK, which had been placed third, with 17.9% of the votes. The SDE (in fourth place, with 10.6%) also joined the Government, thus reviving the coalition that had supported the election of President Ilves. The elections were notable for their use of electronic voting via the internet (the first time anywhere in the world that voters had been able to do so in a national poll).</p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P22">Following a period of rapid growth, the Government was forced to reduce expenditure in 2008, after overestimating tax revenues. This economic slowdown was greatly exacerbated by the global financial crisis that struck in the second half of the year. The Nordic banks controlling the Estonian banking sector drastically restricted the availability of credit. In February 2009 the three parties of the governing coalition agreed on a package of radical budget cuts, but it soon became clear that the Government would have to reduce public spending further to meet the requirements for joining the eurozone, which it had declared as its priority goal, following accession to the European Union (EU) in 2004. Disagreement between Prime Minister Ansip and the Minister of Finance, Ivari Padar of the SDE, over the need to raise taxes, led to Ansip expelling the SDE from the Government in May. Ansip’s ER and the IRL continued in office as a minority Government.</p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P23">The stringent austerity measures implemented by Ansip’s Government brought political dividends, when Estonia adopted the European single currency on 1 January 2011. This achievement helped Ansip’s ruling coalition to secure victory in legislative elections on 6 March. The ER received 28.6% of the votes, while the EK won only 23.3%. The greatest increase in support was enjoyed by the SDE (with 17.1% of the votes), which had been revived by its new, young leader, Sven Mikser. The party system was further consolidated, with only four organizations passing the 5% threshold to obtain representation in the legislature, and the Eestimaa Rahvaliit and the Erakond Eestimaa Rohelised (Estonian Greens) were eliminated from the State Assembly. On 6 April Ansip’s new Government, comprising the same two parties as before (the ER, together with the IRL, which was third placed, with 20.5% of the votes), was sworn into office. Ansip became the first Estonian Prime Minister to have completed a full term in office and to have been re-elected twice consecutively. Furthermore, not only was he the longest-ruling premier among the Baltic states, but he was also one of the longest-serving premiers in the EU as a whole. The triumph of the ruling coalition in the parliamentary elections also smoothed the path for the re-election, on 29 August, of President Ilves to a second five-year term. Ilves’s victory was a further sign of political stability, since no previous head of state had been re-elected by the legislature.</p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P25">Despite this unaccustomed stability, a widespread feeling of dissatisfaction and allegations of government arrogance arose. The increasing exodus of working-age people to seek higher wages abroad, particularly in neighbouring Finland, brought concerns about demographic decline to the fore. A scandal regarding anonymous donations to the ER resulted in the resignation of Kristen Michal as Minister of Justice in December. The subsequent outcry over the financing of political parties led to the emergence of an unprecedented civil society movement, which was channelled into the Rahvakogu (People’s Assembly) internet portal, a unique exercise to collect public proposals for amendments to legislation.</p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P26">The ER performed poorly in the local elections held in October 2013; as in the municipal elections of October 2009, the EK once again obtained an absolute majority in Tallinn, and Savisaar continued as Mayor. Ansip resigned in March 2014. The ER chose Taavi Rõivas, the 34-year-old Minister of Social Affairs, as the new party leader and Prime Minister. On 26 March 2014 a new Government, headed by Rõivas and including Mikser’s SDE as the junior coalition partner, was sworn into office.</p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P27">Among the achievements of the Rõivas Government was the approval in October 2014—despite considerable public opposition—of legislation allowing same-sex civil unions (from 1 January 2016), the first such provision in any country of Central and Eastern Europe. In December 2014 the Government launched the world’s first e-residency (or virtual residency) programme, by means of which non-residents were given virtual residency status and were thereby able to obtain a secure digital identity issued by the Estonian authorities, enabling them to use Estonian state and private sector online services. The main objective of the programme was to encourage the establishment of businesses.</p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P28">The ruling ER was returned to power again at the general election held on 1 March 2015, albeit with a slight loss of support, with 27.7% of the votes cast. Support for the main opposition party, the EK, remained consistent, with 24.8% of the votes. Growing dissatisfaction with the established parliamentary parties was indicated by the success of two new parties in surpassing the 5% threshold to gain representation in the State Assembly; the newly founded, centre-right Eesti Vabaerakond (Estonian Free Party), which championed transparency and `grass roots’ democracy, secured 8.7% of the votes cast, while the Eesti Konservatiivne Rahvaerakond (EKRE—Estonian Conservative People’s Party—formed from the remnants of the Eestimaa Rahvaliit) won 8.1%, becoming the first populist, radical right-wing and Eurosceptic party in Estonia to obtain parliamentary representation. The overall electoral turnout remained stable, at 64.2%. The percentage of voters who cast their ballot online increased to 33.0%, compared with 27.4% in the 2011 elections.</p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P29">Rõivas formed a new coalition Government in April 2015, with the SDE continuing as the ER’s junior partner and with the addition of the IRL (which had been the ER's previous coalition partner prior to Rõivas becoming Prime Minister in March 2014). The cabinet mainly comprised young party stalwarts and very few women. Mikser of the SDE continued as Minister of Defence, the then leader of the IRL, Urmas Reinsalu, was appointed Minister of Justice, and Eiki Nestor of the SDE remained as Speaker of the State Assembly. The coalition’s governing programme promised neither substantial reforms nor new goals.</p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P30">During the second half of 2015 the concern that dominated public debate was a European immigration and refugee crisis. The Government initially opposed the European Commission’s proposal of a mandatory quota for the redistribution of refugees (principally originating from Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria) from Greece and Italy (where the majority of refugees to the EU had arrived), but eventually agreed to accept several hundred refugees over two years. By 2019 refugee arrivals had declined, and many of these did not remain in Estonia, but moved on to Germany or Sweden. Nevertheless, the new, radical right-wing EKRE gained popularity by encouraging fears of uncontrolled immigration.</p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P31">On 3 October 2016 Kersti Kaljulaid was unexpectedly elected to the presidency, becoming the country’s first female head of state. The process of her election had been unprecedented—no candidate received the necessary two-thirds’ majority in three rounds of voting in the State Assembly on 29-30 August, nor in the subsequent electoral college vote held on 24 September, and thus the decision reverted to the State Assembly, which chose the relatively unknown Kaljulaid, who had just completed 12 years as Estonia’s representative at the European Court of Auditors in Luxembourg.</p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P32">A more significant and dramatic political change occurred in November 2016, when the ER’s junior coalition partners, the SDE and the IRL, demanded that Prime Minister Rõivas resign and that the ER be replaced in government by the EK, citing policy differences and amid dissatisfaction with the perceived dominance of the ER (which had been in power continuously for 17 years and had headed the Government for the last 11 years). The proposed switch in coalition partners had only been made possible following a change in the leadership of the EK on 5 November, when Jüri Ratas, a former Mayor of Tallinn, was elected to replace Savisaar. Savisaar, who had headed the EK since its foundation in 1991, was widely viewed as having become an obstacle to political transformation. The veteran politician was suffering from health problems and had been suspended from office as Mayor of Tallinn in September 2015 because of an ongoing corruption investigation. Rõivas announced the resignation of his Government after losing a parliamentary vote of no confidence on 9 November 2016. Ratas was sworn in as the new Prime Minister on 23 November, at the head of a coalition Government comprising the EK, the SDE and the IRL. The main achievements of Ratas’s Government were the successful conclusion of the contentious administrative-territorial reform (involving the merger of municipalities) initiated by the previous administration, and the raising of various taxes to enable an increase in the minimum income exempted from income tax, to benefit the lowest wage-earners. During 2018 and early 2019 revelations emerged of huge Russian money laundering schemes involving the Estonian branches of principal Nordic banks, Danske Bank, Nordea Bank and Swedbank. However, since these were believed to have operated several years earlier, the banking scandal had limited direct political ramifications.</p>
          <p>Parliamentary elections, which took place in Estonia on 3 March 2019, had been expected to be a close contest between the EK, led by Prime Minister Ratas, and the ER, the former governing party. However, in the event the ER secured a clear victory, with 34 seats, compared with 26 for the EK. The EKRE made significant gains and won 19 seats (compared with seven seats previously). The smaller party in the ruling coalition, the SDE, suffered the greatest loss of support (with 10 seats, from 15 previously). The third party in the incumbent Government, the conservative nationalist Isamaa Erakond (Isamaa—Pro Patria Party—as the IRL had been renamed), obtained 12 seats. A newly formed progressive party known as Eesti 200 (Estonia 200) attracted much attention, but failed to reach the 5% threshold required under the proportional representation electoral system. There was no dominant issue during the campaign, although taxation policy was the most salient. The overall voter turnout was 63.7%, a similar level to other recent elections, with a record 44% of participants voting online.</p>
          <p>The leader of the victorious ER, Kaja Kallas (the daughter of former Prime Minister Siim Kallas), was initially nominated by President Kaljulaid as premier, and invited the EK to join a coalition government. However, Ratas unexpectedly began negotiations with the EKRE and Isamaa. After Kallas failed to secure sufficient parliamentary support, Ratas received the presidential nomination and succeeded in establishing a new coalition Government on 29 April 2019. In addition to the post of Prime Minister, retained by Ratas, the EK received the ministries of education and research, of public administration and of social affairs; Taavi Aas of the EK, hitherto Mayor of Tallinn, was appointed to the important post of Minister of Economic Affairs and Infrastructure. Isamaa received the foreign affairs and defence portfolios, which were awarded to the highly experienced incumbent ministers, Urmas Reinsalu and Jüri Luik, respectively, and also obtained control of the ministries of justice, culture and population. The leader of the EKRE, Mart Helme, and his son Martin, were allocated the influential posts of Minister of the Interior and Minister of Finance, respectively. In addition, the EKRE received the ministries responsible for the environment, for rural affairs, and for foreign trade and information technology, while Henn Põlluaas of the EKRE became Speaker of the State Assembly.</p>
          <p>The priorities of the Government, as established in the coalition agreement between the three parties, did not actually envisage many radical departures from existing policies. The Government’s first notable action was to lower taxes on alcohol, which had been a high-profile EKRE campaign pledge. Following pressure from the third coalition party, Isamaa, its main electoral promise of making employee contributions to the so-called second pillar of the pension system optional was also approved by the State Assembly.</p>
          <p>The inclusion of the EKRE in the Government was unexpected and tarnished Estonia’s international image as the most successful of the post-communist countries. During the nearly two years of his new administration, Ratas was obliged to issue frequent apologies for offensive and bizarre utterances made by high-profile members of the EKRE, such as insulting the Prime Minister of Finland or claiming that the US presidential election in November 2020 had been manipulated. President Kaljulaid also rebuked EKRE leaders for their incendiary remarks, but, nevertheless, the EKRE appeared to be setting the agenda and becoming increasingly brazen. While the EKRE’s ascendancy did not result in any major changes in government policies, it led to the vulgarization of public debate. The culmination of the discord in the Government was the EKRE’s initiative to conduct a national referendum to define marriage exclusively as a heterosexual union. The issue dominated the media for months and polarized society. Just as the debate in the legislature was reaching a climax, a corruption scandal erupted on 12 January 2021, when the Prosecutor’s Office announced that it suspected a senior EK official of malpractice involving a real estate development in Tallinn. Ratas (as the leader of the EK) resigned the following day and quickly announced that the EK would not continue in a coalition with the EKRE. Negotiations for a new coalition between the EK and the ER—the coalition that most observers had expected after the 2019 elections—began immediately. By relinquishing the post of Prime Minister, the EK deftly extracted itself from the political quagmire and was able to start afresh.</p>
          <p>When the new Government headed by Kaja Kallas of the ER was sworn in on 26 January 2021 Estonia became the only country worldwide to have both a female Prime Minister and President. Furthermore, it represented the country’s first gender-balanced cabinet, with seven ministerial posts allocated to women. Four EK ministers were retained from the previous administration: Tanel Kiik remained Minister of Health and Labour, the key post in managing the COVID-19 crisis, and Taavi Aas retained the post of Minister of Economic Affairs and Infrastructure. Anneli Ott and Jaak Aab were transferred to the ministries of culture and of public administration, respectively. The EK brought in two independent technocrats: career diplomat Eva-Maria Liimets as Minister of Foreign Affairs and senior police officer Kristjan Jaani as Minister of the Interior. The most powerful cabinet post, the Minister of Finance, was awarded to Keit Pentus-Rosimannus of the ER. Other ER government members with previous ministerial experience were Urmas Kruuse (Minister of Rural Affairs), Maris Lauri (Minister of Justice), and Kalle Laanet (Minister of Defence). Ratas was elected Speaker of the State Assembly.</p>
          <p>The main expectation for the new Government was simply a return to normalcy and competence. The governance agreement was not particularly ambitious, partly because the next national elections were due in two years time, in March 2023. The most notable pledge was to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, most significantly for the Estonian economy by ending the production of oil shale power by 2035. However, the new Government was immediately forced to focus on combating the spread of COVID-19 and minimizing damage to the economy, as the rate of infection grew dramatically in February 2021.</p>
          <p>The Estonian Government first declared a state of emergency in response to the COVID-19 pandemic on 12 March 2020. The borders of the country were closed and mandatory social distancing measures were imposed. The Ratas Government was relatively successful in its public health response, with extensive testing and contact tracing, and lockdown restrictions were ended on 1 June. Estonia was able to function almost normally with minimal restrictions until the onset of a more severe wave of COVID-19 in February 2021, which prompted the imposition of a second lockdown from 11 March until 24 May.</p>
          <p>On 31 August 2021 Alar Karis was elected by the State Assembly as the new President, obtaining 72 votes cast in a second round of voting. The incumbent, Kaljulaid, had failed to secure sufficient support for renomination and Karis was the only candidate put forward by the governing coalition, contesting the election unopposed as an independent. Karis had served as Rector of the University of Tartu, Auditor-General and Director of the Estonian National Museum, and enjoyed broader political and public support than any previous President upon taking office.</p>
          <p>The Government headed by Kallas came under public pressure in January 2022 to curb soaring electricity prices (amid a global energy crisis). Ratas’s EK began to undermine its senior coalition partner, with demands that subsidies be provided for vulnerable groups to offset the rising cost of living. Continued disagreements between the coalition parties culminated in Kallas’s dismissal of the EK ministers in her Government on 3 June. An ER minority cabinet remained in office, and Kallas subsequently began negotiations with Isamaa and the SDE to form a new government. A new, three-party cabinet, led by Kallas, duly took office on 18 July.</p>
          <p>At the general election of 5 March 2023, Kallas’s ER won a resounding victory and increased its share of the vote to 31.2%, taking 37 of the 101 seats in the State Assembly. Although the populist, radical right EKRE rose to second place, with 16.1% of the votes cast and 17 seats, this fell short of expectations. Ratas’s EK suffered the greatest loss in support, which dropped to a low of 15.3% and 16 seats. The liberal party Eesti 200 gained parliamentary representation for the first time, with 13.3% of the votes and 14 seats. The SDE (9.3% and nine seats) and Isamaa (8.2% and eight seats) also obtained representation. The rising cost of living was a principal campaign issue, but concerns for national security suited the ER’s strengths, and the EKRE’s repetition of some Russian propaganda on Ukraine undermined support for the party. The election was also notable for being the first in which the use of electronic voting exceeded paper ballots.</p>
          <p>Kallas formed a new Government with the SDE and Eesti 200, which was sworn into office on 17 April 2023. In addition to the post of Prime Minister, the ER obtained six ministries, while Eesti 200 and the SDE each received three cabinet posts. Lauri Hussar, the leader of Eesti 200, was elected Chairman of the State Assembly. The coalition agreement aimed to balance the state budget within four years while at the same time raising defence expenditure, which necessitated an increase in taxes. The announcement of an increase in value-added tax from 20% to 22% damaged the popularity of the new Government. Among the coalition’s other principal initiatives were legislation to recognize same-sex marriages fully and to expedite the transition to renewable energy.</p>

          <heading>Integration of Ethnic Minorities</heading>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P33">The most problematic social and political issue, and the one that received the most international attention, was the status of the Russian-speaking minority. Estonian legislation was based on the principle that Estonia was not a newly created state, but a restored state that had been illegally occupied from 1940 onwards. Thus, the citizenship law of November 1991 followed the principle of legal continuity; that is, all those who were citizens of Estonia prior to the Soviet annexation in 1940, and their descendants, were automatically citizens of the restored republic. As citizenship was not ethnically based, this included Russians who were citizens of the pre-Second World War state and their descendants. However, the majority of Russians did not arrive in Estonia until after the Second World War and had to apply to be naturalized. Initially, the requirements were two years’ residency, plus a one-year waiting period and an elementary knowledge of the Estonian language. Many non-Estonians, however, proved unable or unwilling to take the language test. Consequently, a substantial number of residents opted instead to take Russian citizenship. For those who did not apply for citizenship, the Estonian Government issued an aliens’ passport that served as an international travel document.</p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P34">Predictions of ethnic unrest and the possible rise of a secessionist movement in the predominantly Russian north-eastern region of the country did not come to pass during the 1990s, and the situation remained remarkably calm. Although the Russian Government repeatedly accused Estonia of systematic discrimination and the violation of the human rights of ethnic Russians in Estonia, international organizations such as the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) found no evidence to justify such claims. Nevertheless, the OSCE and the EU urged Estonia to relax its citizenship and language legislation and to be more accommodating towards the non-Estonian minority. In particular, the substantial number of stateless persons—those who had chosen neither Estonian nor Russian citizenship—remained a concern.</p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P35">Several important measures were implemented to encourage the integration of the Russian-speaking minority into Estonian society. The State Integration Programme was introduced by the Government in 2000, temporary residence permits were replaced by permanent residence permits for non-citizens and stateless persons, and changes were made to language legislation, relaxing requirements for the use of Estonian in the private sector. By the end of 2001 Estonia had fulfilled all the recommendations of the OSCE regarding the rights of ethnic minorities. The final measure was the amendment of the electoral law to allow candidates who did not know the state language to stand for election. The progress made in addressing the concerns of the Russian-speaking minority was demonstrated by the closure of the OSCE mission in Estonia at the end of 2001, upon the fulfilment of its mandate.</p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P36">In 2007 an issue of symbolic significance—the statue of a Red Army soldier in central Tallinn—caused strong divisions along ethnic lines in Estonian society. The statue was resented by most Estonians as a symbol of occupation but cherished by many ethnic Russians as a memorial to fallen Soviet troops. The Government of Andrus Ansip, claiming that the site of the statue might become a venue for confrontation between ethnic extremists, decided to relocate the statue to a less prominent location, in the Tallinn military cemetery, in April. Following the forceful dispersal of pro-monument demonstrators by the police, groups of russophone youths carried out acts of vandalism in central Tallinn; one person was reported to have been killed in the unrest and more than 150 others injured.</p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P37">Another issue that has occasioned controversy is the greater usage of Estonian in Russian-language schools. The policy was implemented in stages and entered fully into force in 2011, requiring 60% of teaching to be in Estonian and 40% in Russian. The Government argued that knowledge of the state language was necessary for ethnic Russian youths to be successfully integrated into Estonian society and to be adequately equipped for the job market. Opponents of the policy argued that many Russian-language schools were not yet prepared for the new system, since many of the teachers were not capable of teaching their subject in Estonian. In relation to education reform and the integration of minorities, a positive measure was the first ministerial appointment of an ethnic Russian, that of Jevgeni Ossinovski to the Government formed in March 2014. In May 2015 he was elected leader of the SDE, becoming the first russophone head of a major political party.</p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P38">Meanwhile, the integration of russophone Estonians once again became an issue of intense debate following the Russian Federation’s annexation of the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine in March 2014 and the claim by Russian President Vladimir Putin that Russia was justified in using military intervention to protect Russian-speakers wherever they might reside. Russia’s aggression against Ukraine was accompanied by propaganda in the Russia media. This was of particular concern to the Estonian authorities, since Estonian russophones predominantly viewed Russian television channels. In an attempt to counter this, the Estonian Government established a new Russian-language television channel in 2015 to provide information from an avowedly more objective viewpoint; however, the new channel proved unable to compete in popularity with Russian television. An opportunity for a shift in attitude came with the installation in November 2016 of the new Government led by Jüri Ratas of the EK, since the party traditionally enjoyed the support of the majority of the russophone population. Following the parliamentary elections in March 2019, which led to the formation of the second Ratas Government, Mihhail Kõlvart of the EK became the first russophone Mayor of Tallinn, a development of symbolic significance.</p>
          <p>Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, the loyalties of the Russian minority again came under scrutiny. In accordance with wide-ranging EU sanctions imposed against Russia, the Estonian Government banned the broadcast of Russian television channels. In response to the war in Ukraine, the Government decided to remove many of the remaining Soviet war monuments around the country. Following increasing demands, in December the State Assembly adopted legislation on the long-delayed implementation of a full transition to Estonian as the language of instruction in Russian-language schools. While most Estonians warmly welcomed Ukrainian refugees, many Russian-speakers had reservations towards them. The question of whether the children of Ukrainian refugees would be placed in Estonian- or Russian-language schools became a cause of controversy. Citing security concerns, the Estonian Government did not allow Russians who had fled the country after the declaration of a partial mobilization in September to claim asylum.</p>

          <heading>Relations with the Russian Federation</heading>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P39">The primary concern of Estonian foreign policy from 1991 to 1994 was the removal of former Soviet troops from the country’s territory. The troops’ withdrawal was completed in August 1994, after Estonia agreed to give social and civil guarantees to retired Soviet military personnel residing in Estonia. The military withdrawal did not, however, lead to a relaxation of tensions between the neighbours. Russia expressed disapproval of Estonia’s insistence on attempting to gain membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), of the status of ethnic Russians in Estonia, and of the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church’s return to the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople (based in İstanbul, Turkey—now known as Türkiye), independent of the Moscow Patriarchate. Estonians, in turn, were alarmed by what was perceived as neo-imperialist rhetoric in Russian politics and Russia’s refusal to acknowledge that the incorporation of Estonia into the USSR in 1940 had been carried out against the will of the Estonian population.</p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P40">A further obstacle to improved relations between the two countries was a border dispute regarding land awarded to Estonia in 1920, by the Treaty of Tartu, but annexed by Russia in 1945. In 1995 Estonia renounced its territorial claims, in the hope that Russia would reciprocate by recognizing the validity of the 1920 Treaty, which would amount to an acknowledgement that the Soviet occupation of 1940 was illegal. Agreement was reached in 1999 and the text of a border treaty was initialled by the countries’ respective Ministers of Foreign Affairs. However, the Russian Government delayed signing the treaty, apparently hoping that by leaving the issue unresolved it could hinder Estonia’s progress towards NATO and EU membership. After Estonia’s accession to the EU (and NATO) in 2004, the border treaty was finally signed in May 2005 by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Estonia and Russia in Moscow. The treaty was quickly ratified by the Estonian parliament, which cited founding documents of the republic, thus making implicit reference to the legal continuity of the state. Russia reacted angrily, withdrawing its signature from the treaty.</p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P41">A difficult issue for Estonia has been Russia’s use of energy supply as a means to reassert its status and divide the EU. This became apparent in 2005, when Germany and Russia agreed to construct a natural gas pipeline, known as Nord Stream, underneath the Baltic Sea, thereby bypassing several of the new EU member states. The Baltic states responded by vigorously lobbying for an EU common energy policy. Estonia is particularly concerned about the potential environmental risks posed by the Nord Stream project. Furthermore, Russia announced plans to build several new warships for its Baltic Fleet, which could participate in guarding the pipeline. In 2007 the Estonian Government rejected an application by the Nord Stream consortium to survey the seabed in Estonia’s economic zone as a possible route for the pipeline. In 2012 Nord Stream sought similar permission for Nord Stream 2, but the Estonian Government once again refused. As Nord Stream 2 was completed in 2021, Estonia remained adamantly opposed to the project, which, despite the imposition of US sanctions against it, continued to receive the support of Germany.</p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P42">
      Russia reacted angrily to the relocation of the Red Army war monument in Tallinn (see 
      <i>Integration of Ethnic Minorities</i>
      ) in April 2007. Members of the Russian state-sponsored youth organization Nashi (Our Own) imposed a blockade on the Estonian embassy in Moscow, prompting statements of support for Estonia by the EU and NATO. At the beginning of May the Russian Government adopted a new strategy and began an unofficial boycott of Estonian goods. The most profitable sector of Estonian-Russian trade, the transit of oil, collapsed as Russian companies directed their business away from Estonia. The internet sites of Estonian government institutions also suffered cyber attacks during May.
    </p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P43">The Russian invasion of Georgia in August 2008 was met with alarm in Estonia and resulted in demonstrations of solidarity with Georgia. The initial Russian justification for moving its troops into the Georgian secessionist territory of South Ossetia—that of `protecting Russian citizens’—was of particular concern for Estonia, since, with around 7% of the Estonian population holding Russian citizenship, such a pretext could also conceivably apply to it in the future.</p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P44">
      As US and EU relations with Russia began to improve in 2010, there were also some modest positive signs that the tensions between Estonia and Russia could be alleviated. President Ilves’s decision to attend the Russian Victory Day parade (commemorating the end of the Second World War) in Moscow on 9 May—the first occasion that an Estonian President had done so—was regarded as highly symbolic. In 2012 the foreign affairs committees of the Estonian State Assembly and the Russian State Duma resumed contact for the first time in several years. The first visit of an Estonian Prime Minister to Russia in over a decade took place in April 2013, while in June Kirill (Gundyayev), the Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus, visited Estonia. The most significant breakthrough in relations between Estonia and Russia came in May, when it was announced that the two Governments had agreed upon mutually acceptable wording for a border treaty. On 18 February 2014 the border treaty was signed by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Estonia and Russia in Moscow; however, neither country subsequently ratified the treaty
      
      .
    </p>
          <p>The positive momentum in bilateral relations suffered a severe reverse with Russia’s annexation of the Ukrainian autonomous territory of Crimea in March 2014, followed by Russian attempts to destabilize eastern Ukraine. The Estonian Government appealed to the international community to respond resolutely to Russia’s breach of international law. Estonia strongly supported the EU’s imposition of sanctions against Russia to demonstrate the Union’s condemnation of changing borders by force and to serve as a deterrent against further Russian military intervention in Ukraine. However, Estonia demanded more stringent sanctions than those imposed by the EU, despite the fact that they were also having an adverse impact on the Estonian economy (particularly in the transportation, tourism and agricultural—notably dairy product—sectors). In September an Estonian security police officer, Eston Kohver, was detained in Russia, the Estonian authorities claiming that he had been abducted by the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) from the Estonian side of the border. He was returned to Estonia one year later, after the Estonian authorities released a former Estonian security officer who had been convicted of espionage on behalf of Russia. In response, the Estonian Government announced plans to clear the entire border zone with Russia of forestland and to erect a well-monitored border fence.</p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P45">In a modest step towards reviving the bilateral relationship, President Kaljulaid made a working visit to Moscow on 18 April 2019 to meet Russian President Putin. Although it was the first bilateral meeting in many years, it failed to produce any results. In April 2021 Estonia expelled a Russian diplomat in solidarity with the Czech Republic’s accusation that Russian military intelligence agents were responsible for a bomb attack on its territory in 2014. Russia reciprocated by ordering an Estonian diplomat to leave the country. The hostile relationship was also worsened by Estonia’s recognition of opposition candidate Svyatlana Tsikhanouskaya as the legitimate winner of the Belarusian presidential election in August 2020. A subsequent campaign of peaceful protests in Belarus was met with brutal force by the regime of President Alyaksandr Lukashenka, who was supported by Russia.</p>
          <p>The Estonian Government had repeatedly warned about the seriousness of Russia’s aggressive intentions prior to its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. In response to the invasion, Estonia was a leading proponent within the EU of imposing more severe sanctions against Russia. Estonia was one of the first countries to supply Ukraine with lethal aid prior to the invasion, and during the first year of the war was the largest donor per capita of military assistance to Ukraine, providing €400m. of defence equipment, equivalent to around 1% of the country’s GDP. In addition, Estonian civil society mobilized to send large amounts of humanitarian aid to Ukraine. By 2023 some 50,000 Ukrainian refugees, mainly women and children, had arrived in Estonia, a number equivalent to 4% of the Estonian population. Estonia and Russia have expelled most of the diplomats based in each other’s embassies and consulates. Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas has become one of the most prominent proponents in international organizations (such as the EU and NATO) and the global media for a principled and resolute stance to assist Ukraine in defeating Russia.</p>

          <heading>Foreign Policy and European Integration</heading>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P46">Estonia’s primary foreign policy objective in the period after independence was to integrate rapidly into European and transatlantic institutions. The first step was admission to the Council of Europe in May 1993. However, the main focus of Estonian efforts was membership of the EU and NATO. Estonia applied for EU membership in 1995. Owing to its more rapid economic reforms, in December 1997 Estonia was the only one of the Baltic states among six countries invited to commence EU membership negotiations in 1998. Although this initially led to some concern about the future of Baltic solidarity, it provided a boost to Estonia’s image internationally. Paradoxically, of the candidate countries, opinion polls consistently showed the Estonian population to be the most sceptical about the benefits of accession to the EU, although the country’s principal political parties were unanimous in their support for membership. Thus, there was a clear divergence between the political elite and the general public—a common state of affairs in many other EU member states.</p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P47">In December 2002 accession negotiations were successfully completed at an EU summit meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark. In a referendum held on 14 September 2003, which attracted a turnout of 64.1% of the electorate, some 66.8% of those who voted approved EU accession. Estonia joined the EU on 1 May 2004, together with nine other countries (including Latvia and Lithuania). In December 2007 Estonia joined the Schengen area of free movement without border controls in the EU, and the State Assembly ratified the Treaty of Lisbon in June 2008.</p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P48">Former Prime Minister Siim Kallas was appointed Estonia’s representative to the European Commission in 2004. At elections to the European Parliament held in June 2004, the SDE won three of the six seats allocated to Estonia, mainly owing to the popularity of its leader, Toomas Hendrik Ilves, whereas the governing parties each obtained only a single seat. At elections to the European Parliament in June 2009, the opposition EK won two of Estonia’s six seats, and an independent candidate, the ER, the IRL and the SDE each secured one seat. The results of the European Parliament elections held on 25 May 2014 changed Estonia’s representation only slightly: the ER won two seats, while the EK, the IRL, the SDE and an independent candidate each received one mandate. Although fierce rivals at the national level, the ER and the EK belonged to the same political group in the European Parliament, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. Former Prime Minister Andrus Ansip became Estonia’s new EU Commissioner, responsible for the Digital Single Market. At the European Parliament elections held in May 2019, the ER list headed by Ansip was once again successful, securing 26.2% of the votes cast and two seats; the SDE, with 23.3% of the vote, also won two seats, while the EK and the EKRE each obtained one seat. The new Government appointed the former Minister of Economic Affairs and Infrastructure, Kadri Simson of the EK, as its representative to the European Commission, in which she was allocated the energy portfolio.</p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P49">The issues prioritized by Estonia during its first years of EU membership were increased competitiveness; the promotion of an information society (especially electronic governance and transparency); the propagation of further enlargement; and the strengthening of the EU’s relations with Eastern European states, particularly Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia, a policy framework known as the Eastern Partnership. The Government’s most cherished objective was the creation of the EU’s so-called Digital Single Market. Estonia successfully established itself as a leader in the information and communications technology sector, as illustrated by the launch of the European Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA) in Tallinn in December 2012.</p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P50">Estonia’s successful EU integration culminated in its adoption of the euro on 1 January 2011, after having met the euro convergence criteria (also known as the Maastricht criteria). Accession to the eurozone was viewed as a positive strategy towards recovery from the severe impact of the economic crisis in 2008. It was also an important move to avert the threat of devaluation of the national currency. Furthermore, membership of the eurozone had the important psychological effect of making Estonians no longer perceive themselves to be `second-class Europeans’. In addition, in December 2010 Estonia become a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). This allowed Estonian politicians to assert that Estonia was now the most integrated state in Northern Europe—the only one that was a member of all the most exclusive clubs: the EU, the eurozone, the OECD and NATO. As a new member of the eurozone, Estonia was eager to be seen as a constructive member state. Encountering little opposition in the State Assembly, at the end of September 2011 Estonia voted to join the European Financial Stability Facility. Nevertheless, there was considerable public resentment that the poorest country in the eurozone would be obliged to help bail out wealthier member states that had broken the rules. The treaty establishing the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), which the Government signed in February 2012, was challenged as unconstitutional by the Chancellor of Justice (Ombudsman). However, the Supreme Court narrowly ruled in favour of the Government, allowing the ratification of the ESM by the State Assembly on 30 August.</p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P52">During the second half of 2017 Estonia for the first time held the rotating presidency of the Council of the EU. The main priority of the Estonian Presidency was to promote the establishment of the Digital Single Market. Other major focuses of attention were the EU’s Eastern Partnership and the launch of negotiations on the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the Union (Brexit). Estonia strongly supported the designation of Ukraine and Moldova as official candidates for EU membership in June 2022 (after both countries had submitted membership applications in early March, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine).</p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P53">Membership of NATO was widely considered to be the only possible guarantee of Estonian security following independence. The idea of neutrality, which was proposed in the early 1990s, was firmly rejected. Estonia joined NATO’s `Partnership for Peace’ programme in 1994. The three Baltic states petitioned hard for NATO membership and struggled to overcome Western apprehension that enlargement to include them could prompt a negative Russian reaction. Estonia strove to demonstrate that a small country could contribute to the Alliance, particularly through the efforts of its peacekeeping troops, which served in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq. Co-operation with Latvia and Lithuania in forming a joint infantry battalion, naval squadron, air surveillance system and staff college also served to demonstrate preparedness for membership of the Alliance. Successive Estonian governments steadily increased defence expenditure, pledging to reach a level of 2% of gross domestic product (GDP) to conform with NATO standards (a target finally met in 2012). Estonian efforts were rewarded at a NATO summit, held in Prague, Czech Republic, in 2002, when the country was formally invited to join the Alliance. Estonia duly became a full member of NATO on 29 March 2004.</p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P54">Within the Alliance, like other relatively new member states from Central and Eastern Europe, Estonia has sought to preserve a strong transatlantic link. A contingent of Estonian troops participated in the post-war security operation in Iraq from 2003 to 2009. During 2003-14 Estonian troops also engaged in combat under British command in Afghanistan, where they suffered several fatalities. Estonia has taken the lead within NATO of emphasizing the importance of cyber defence. In May 2008 the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence was established in Tallinn. Estonia has strongly supported the further enlargement of NATO. At a May 2012 NATO summit in Chicago, Illinois, USA, NATO air policing of the Baltic states’ airspace, which had hitherto been carried out on an ad hoc basis, was confirmed as an Alliance policy.</p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P55">In response to the Russian annexation of Crimea in March 2014, NATO member states for the first time deployed fighter aircraft at the newly opened Ämari airbase in Estonia as part of its Baltic air-policing mission, whereas previously aircraft had been stationed only in Lithuania. At a summit held in Newport, UK, in September NATO resolved to create a new rapid reaction force, but decided against establishing permanent bases in the Baltic states. During 2015 the frequency of Russian military aircraft and warship activity in the Baltic Sea area near Estonia’s borders increased, as did the numbers of military personnel and equipment belonging to NATO states conducting rotating exercises on Estonian territory. Following a decision reached at a NATO summit held in Warsaw, Poland, in July 2016 to adopt the posture of Enhanced Forward Presence on its eastern flank—the deployment on a rotating basis of four multinational NATO battalion battlegroups in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland—troops and equipment from Estonia’s framework or lead nation, the UK, arrived in March 2017. After Donald Trump became the US President in 2017, the USA increased its military assistance to the Baltic states. Nevertheless, Estonia had concerns about the cohesion of NATO, since many of Trump’s statements seemingly brought the USA’s commitment to collective defence into question. The inauguration of Joe Biden as the new US President on 20 January 2021 was welcomed by the Baltic states, since he vowed to restore the damaged transatlantic relationship and take a tougher stance towards Russia.</p>
          <p>Reacting to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, NATO allies increased their presence in the countries of the eastern flank, including Estonia. The UK stationed additional troops and equipment in Estonia, while the USA deployed fighter aircraft and other NATO allies also increased their presence in the country. The Estonian Government raised its defence spending to 2.5% of GDP, and in 2023 announced a further increase to 3% of GDP for 2024-27. The Baltic states pressed for NATO to strengthen its deterrence posture in the region, in other words to have a permanent deployment rather than just a rotational force, and to increase its size from a battalion to a brigade.</p>
          <p id="COPY.EDITED.EE.HI.P56">A central feature of Estonian foreign policy has been close co-operation with Latvia and Lithuania. The major forum for this co-operation was the Baltic Assembly, a consultative body consisting of the parliamentary deputies of all three countries, established in 1991. However, following Baltic membership of the EU, the importance of the Assembly declined. Nevertheless, inter-Baltic co-operation continues to be vital for the success of EU-funded large infrastructure projects, such as the high-speed rail link `Rail Baltica’ to connect Tallinn with Central Europe, via Warsaw. During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, in May 2020 Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania were the first European countries to open a `travel bubble’, allowing their citizens to move freely between the three countries. Defence initiatives have been a core component of trilateral co-operation and, following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, joint efforts in the military sphere have burgeoned.</p>
          <p>Co-operation with Nordic countries, particularly Finland and Sweden, has also played a crucial role in Estonia’s successful transition to a free market democracy. From 1992 an institutional framework for co-operation was provided by the Council of the Baltic Sea States. Increasingly, high-level political meetings took place using a `five-plus-three’ format: the Nordic states (Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Iceland) and the Baltic states. With the enlargement of the EU, the trend towards regional integration was further enhanced. In 2009 the EU adopted its Baltic Sea Strategy. The Nordic countries are the most significant investors in the region and support the interests of the Baltic states in international organizations. Relations between Estonia and Finland are especially close, not only because the Finnish capital, Helsinki, is just 85 km from Tallinn, but also because of their linguistic kinship and cultural connections. Bilateral links could intensify if preliminary discussions eventually lead to the construction of a proposed Helsinki-Tallinn undersea rail tunnel. Applications submitted by Finland and Sweden to join NATO in May 2022 were enthusiastically welcomed by member states, and the draft protocols on accession were immediately ratified by the Estonian State Assembly.</p>
