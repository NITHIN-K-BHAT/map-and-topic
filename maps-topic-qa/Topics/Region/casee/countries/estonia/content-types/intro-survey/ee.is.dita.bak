               <p id="EE.IS.3">The Republic of Estonia is situated in north-eastern Europe. The country is bordered to the south by Latvia and to the east by the Russian Federation. Estonia’s northern coastline is on the Gulf of Finland, and its territory includes more than 1,520 islands, mainly off its western coastline in the Gulf of Rīga and the Baltic Sea. The largest islands are Saaremaa and Hiiumaa, in the Gulf of Rīga. The climate is influenced by Estonia’s position between the Eurasian land mass and the Baltic Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean. The mean January temperature in Tallinn is −0.6°C (30.9°F); in July the mean temperature is 17.1°C (62.8°F). Average annual precipitation is 568&#160;mm. The official language is Estonian, a member of the Baltic-Finnic group of the Finno-Ugric languages. However, Russian is widely spoken among the ethnic Russian minority (which made up 23.7% of the total population at the 2021 census). Most of the population profess Christianity. By tradition, Estonians belong to the Evangelical Lutheran Church. Smaller Protestant sects and the Eastern Orthodox Church are also represented. The national flag (proportions 7 by 11) consists of three equal horizontal stripes, of blue, black and white. The capital is Tallinn.</p>

                    <heading>Historical Context</heading>
                    <p id="EE.IS.5">The Russian annexation of Estonia, formerly under Swedish rule, was formalized in 1721. In the late 19th century, as the powers of the dominant Baltic German nobility declined, Estonians experienced a national cultural revival, which culminated in political demands for autonomy during the 1905 Russian Revolution and for full independence after the beginning of the First World War. In March 1917 the new Provisional Government of Russia approved autonomy for Estonia. However, in October the Bolsheviks staged a coup in Tallinn. As German forces advanced towards Estonia in early 1918, the Bolshevik troops were forced to leave, and on 24 February an independent Republic of Estonia was proclaimed. A Provisional Government, led by Konstantin Päts, was formed, but Germany refused to recognize Estonia’s independence, and its troops occupied Estonia. Following Germany’s capitulation in November, a Provisional Government assumed power. After a period of armed conflict, Estonia and Soviet Russia signed the Treaty of Tartu on 2 February 1920, under the terms of which the Soviet Government recognized Estonia’s independence and renounced any rights to its territory.</p>
                    <p id="EE.IS.6">The economic depression of the 1930s caused public dissatisfaction, and in March 1934 Prime Minister Päts seized power in a bloodless coup. The Riigikogu (State Assembly) and political parties were disbanded, but in 1938 a new Constitution was adopted, providing for a presidential system of government, with a bi­cam­eral legislature. In April Päts was elected President.</p>
                    <p id="EE.IS.7">In August 1939 the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and Germany signed a non-aggression treaty (the Nazi-Soviet or Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact). In September Estonia was forced to sign an agreement permitting the USSR to base troops there. In June 1940 the Government resigned, and the Soviet authorities appointed a new administration. In July elections were held, in which only candidates approved by the Soviet authorities were per­mitted to participate. On 21 July the new legislature proclaimed an Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic, and on 6 August the republic was formally incorporated into the USSR.</p>
                    <p id="EE.IS.9">German forces entered Estonia in July 1941 and remained in occupation until September 1944. Thereafter, Soviet troops occupied the country, and the process of sovietization’, including industrialization and the collectivization of agriculture, was resumed. Structural change in the economy was accompanied by increased political repression, and the mass deportation of Estonians continued until the death of the Soviet leader Stalin (Iosif Dzhugashvili) in 1953.</p>
                    <p id="EE.IS.10">The policy of glasnost (openness), introduced by the Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, in 1986, allowed questions such as russification’ and environmental degradation to spread beyond dissident groups. In August 1987 a demonstration attended by some 2,000 people commemorated the anniversary of the signing of the Nazi-Soviet Pact, and a pressure group demanding its publication was subsequently formed. In 1988 the Pact was duly published, and the group was reconstituted as the Eesti Rahvusliku Sõltumatuse Partei (ERSP—Estonian National Independence Party), which sought the restoration of Estonian independence. Another opposition association, the Eestimaa Rahvarinne (Rahvarinne—Popular Front of Estonia), which included many members of the ruling Eestimaa Kommunistlik Partei (EKP—Communist Party of Estonia), and which advocated the transformation of the USSR into a confederal system, held its first congress in October. On 16 November the Estonian Supreme Soviet (Supreme Council—legislature) adopted a declaration of sovereignty, which included the right to annul all-Union (USSR) legislation. The Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet ruled the declaration unconstitutional, but the Estonian Supreme Soviet affirmed its decision in December.</p>
                    <p id="EE.IS.11">The adoption of Estonian as the state language was accepted by the Supreme Soviet in January 1989, and the tricolour of independent Estonia was reinstated as the official flag. Meanwhile, the ERSP refused to nominate candidates for elections to the all-Union Congress of People’s Deputies in March. Rahvarinne, however, participated in the elections and won 27 of the 36 contested seats. Five seats were won by the Interliikumine/Interdvizheniye (Intermovement), a political group composed predominantly of ethnic Russians opposed to the growing influence of Estonian pro-independence movements. In October delegates at the second congress of Rahvarinne voted to adopt the restoration of Estonian independence as official policy. In November the Estonian Su­preme Soviet voted to annul the 1940 decision to enter the USSR, declaring that the decision had been reached under coercion from Soviet armed forces.</p>
                    <p id="EE.IS.13">On 2 February 1990 a mass rally was held to commemorate the anniversary of the 1920 Treaty of Tartu. Deputies attending the rally later met to approve a declaration urging the USSR Supreme Soviet to begin negotiations on restoring Estonia’s independence. On 22 February 1990 the Estonian Supreme Soviet approved the declaration and on the following day voted to abolish the EKP’s constitutional guarantee of power, thereby permitting largely free elections to take place to the Estonian Supreme Soviet in March. Rahvarinne won 43 of the 105 seats, 35 were won by pro-independence groups, and 27 by members allied to the Interliikumine/Interdvizheniye. Candi­dates belonging to the EKP, which was represented in all these groups, won 55 seats. Arnold Rüütel, previously Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, was elected to the new post of Chairman of the Supreme Soviet. On 30 March the Supreme Soviet adopted a declaration that proclaimed the beginning of a transitional period towards inde­pendence. In late February and early March some 580,000 people had taken part in elections to the rival parliament to the Supreme Soviet, the Eesti Kongress (Estonian Congress). The Congress convened on 11-12 March and declared itself to be the constitutional representative of the Estonian people.</p>

                    <heading>Domestic Political Affairs</heading>
                    <p id="EE.IS.16">In April 1990 the Supreme Soviet elected Edgar Savisaar, a leader of Rahvarinne, as Prime Minister, and on 8 May it voted to restore the first five articles of the 1938 Constitution, which described Estonia’s independent status. The formal name of the Republic of Estonia was also restored, as were the pre-1940 state emblems, flag and anthem. In May 1990 Gorbachev (recently appointed as the first President of the USSR) annulled Estonia’s declaration of independence, declaring that it violated the USSR Constitution. He also refused requests for negotiations on the status of the republic prior to the rescission of the declaration of independence.</p>
                    <p id="EE.IS.18">After troops of the USSR’s Ministry of the Interior attempted military intervention in the other Baltic republics (Latvia and Lithuania) in January 1991, barricades and makeshift defences were erected in Estonia. Estonia re­fused to particip­ate in a referendum on the future of the USSR, which took place in nine of the republics in March. On 3 March the Estonian authorities conducted a poll on independence. According to the official results, 82.9% of the registered electorate took part, of whom 77.8% voted in favour of Estonian independence.</p>
                    <p id="EE.IS.19">At the same time as an attempted coup by conservative communists in the USSR on 19 August 1991, Gen. Fyodor Kuzmin, the Soviet commander of the Baltic military district, informed Rüütel that he was taking full control of Estonia. Military vehicles entered Tallinn on 20 August, and troops occupied the city’s television station. The Estonian Supreme Council adopted a resolution declaring the full and immediate independence of Estonia. After it became evident, on 22 August, that the Soviet coup had failed, the Government began to take measures against those who had supported it, while the Interliikumine/Interdvizheniye, the Kommunisticheskaya Partiya Sovetskogo Soyuza (Communist Party of the Soviet Union) and other pro-Soviet movements were banned in Estonia.</p>

                         <heading>Consolidation of Statehood</heading>
                         <p id="EE.IS.21">
            As the Estonian Government moved to assert its authority over former Soviet institutions, other countries recognized Estonian independence, including, on 6 September 1991, the USSR. Later in the month Estonia, together with the other Baltic states, was admitted to the United Nations (UN), as well as to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (later the 
            <xr pageref="Y" ref="OSCE.IO">Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe—OSCE)</xr>
            . During the remainder of 1991 Estonia established diplomatic relations with most major states and was offered membership of other international organizations. Meanwhile, a Constitutional Assembly, comprising equal numbers of delegates from the Estonian Congress and the Supreme Council, was established. In January 1992 Savisaar resigned as Prime Minister and was replaced by the erstwhile Minister of Transport, Tiit Vähi. The Supreme Council approved a new Council of Ministers at the end of the month.
          </p>
                         <p id="EE.IS.23">A total of 91% of the electorate approved the draft Constitution in a referendum held in June 1992. Under the recently adopted Citizenship Law, only citizens of pre-1940 Estonia and their descendants, or those who had successfully applied for citizenship, were entitled to vote. The Constitution entered into force in July 1992. Elections to the new legislature, the State Assembly, were to be held in September, concurrently with a direct presidential election, although subsequent presi­dents were to be elected by the State Assembly.</p>
                         <p id="EE.IS.24">Legislative and presidential elections were held on 20 September 1992, with the participation of 67% of the electorate. Russian and other ethnic minorities, then representing 42% of the total population, were barred from voting (with the exception of those whose applications for citizenship had been granted). The nationalist Isamaa (Pro Patria) alliance emerged with the largest number of seats (29) in the 101-seat State Assembly. The Kindel Kodu (KK—Secure Home) alliance, comprising former communists, obtained 17 seats, the Rahvarinne-led centrist alliance won 15 seats, the Mõõdukad (Moderates) electoral alliance obtained 12 and the ERSP won 10. Rüütel, now a leading member of the KK, and Lennart Meri, a former Minister of Foreign Affairs supported by Isamaa, contested a second round of presidential voting on 5 October, when the State Assembly elected Meri as President. A coalition Government, comprising members of Isamaa, Mõõdukad and the ERSP and led by Mart Laar, the leader of Isamaa, was announced in October. In November four of the five constituent parties of the Isamaa alliance united to form the Rahvuslik Koonderakond Isamaa (RKI—National Pro Patria Party), under Laar’s leadership.</p>
                         <p id="EE.IS.26">Defections from the Isamaa faction within the State Assembly resulted in Laar’s supporters retaining control of only 19 seats in the legislature by September 1993. After it emerged that Laar had contra­vened an agreement with the International Monetary Fund, the State Assembly endorsed a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister. In October Andres Tarand, hitherto Minister of the Environment, was appointed to replace Laar. A new Council of Ministers, including representatives of the RKI, Mõõdukad, the ERSP and liberal and right-wing parties, was announced in November.</p>
                         <p id="EE.IS.27">The results of legislative elections on 5 March 1995 reflected popular dissatisfaction with the governing parties. An alliance of the centrist Eesti Koonderakond (Estonian Coalition Party, led by Vähi) and the Eesti Maarahva Erakond (EME—Estonian Rural Union, in which Rüütel was a prominent figure) won 41 seats. A coalition of the newly established Eesti Reformierakond (ER—Estonian Reform Party, led by Siim Kallas, the President of the Bank of Estonia) and liberal groups obtained 19 seats, followed by Savisaar’s Eesti Keskerakond (EK—Estonian Centre Party), with 16. The RKI (in coalition with the ERSP) won eight seats, while the Mõõdukad alliance obtained six. Almost 70% of the registered electorate participated.</p>
                         <p id="EE.IS.28">Vähi was confirmed as Prime Minister by the legislature in April 1995, and his Government—a coalition of the Eesti Koonderakond, the EME and the EK—was appointed later in the month. However, in early October the revelation that Savisaar, the Minister of the Interior, had made clandestine recordings of political negotiations precipitated the resignation of the Government. President Meri reappointed Vähi as Prime Minister, and a new ruling coalition, again comprising the three parties, was formed later in October. In December the RKI and the ERSP merged to create the Isamaaliit (Pro Patria Union).</p>
                         <p id="EE.IS.29">Meri was re-elected as President by an electoral college in late September 1996, defeating Rüütel, with 52% of the votes cast, and in October he was sworn in for a second presidential term. Also in October, following local government elections, the ER secured control of Tallinn City Council. In November the Eesti Koonderakond concluded a co-operation agreement with the EK. Disagreements among the coalition partners led to the collapse of the city leadership, and Savisaar was appointed as Chairman of the City Council, replacing the recently elected ER candidate. The ER threatened to leave the Government unless the co-operation agreement with the EK was cancelled, and in November six ministers, including Kallas (hitherto the Minister for Foreign Affairs), resigned, causing the collapse of the ruling coalition. A minority Government, comprising the Eesti Koonderakond, the EME and independ­ents, was appointed in December. Vähi tendered his resignation in February 1997, amid allegations of abuse of office. Mart Siimann, the leader of the Eesti Koonderakond parliamentary faction, was appointed Prime Minister. In March a minority Government, comprising the Eesti Koonderakond, the EME and independents, was ap­pointed.</p>

                         <heading>The 1999 Legislative Elections</heading>
                         <p id="EE.IS.32">At legislative elections held on 7 March 1999, the EK won 28 of the 101 seats; the ER and Isamaaliit each secured 18 seats, Mõõdukad (in alliance with the Eesti Rahvaerakond—Estonian People’s Party) 17, the EME seven and the Eestimaa Ühendatud Rahvapartei (United People’s Party of Estonia) six. Voter turnout was recorded at 57.4% of the electorate. The EK was unable to assemble a majority, and a centre-right coalition Government was formed by the ER, Isamaaliit and Mõõdukad; Laar, now leader of Isamaaliit, was appointed as Prime Minister.</p>
                         <p id="EE.IS.33">In May 1999 it was announced that some 300,000 people permanently resident in Estonia without citizenship (principally ethnic Russians) were to be allowed to participate in local elections in October. In November Mõõdukad and the Eesti Rahvaerakond merged to form the Rahvaerakond Mõõdukad (RM—Moderate People’s Party). In June 2000 the Eestimaa Rahvaliit (Estonian People’s Union) was formed by the merger of the EME and two smaller parties.</p>
                         <p id="EE.IS.36">Following inconclusive rounds of presidential voting in the State Assembly on 27-28 August 2001, an electoral college was convened on 21 September. Rüütel, now the Hon­orary Chairman of Eestimaa Rahvaliit, won the second round, with 186 votes. He was sworn in as President on 8 October.</p>
                         <p id="EE.IS.37">In December 2001 the ER announced that it was to leave the Tallinn City Government, and it subsequently signed a coalition agreement with the EK. Tõnis Palts resigned as Mayor when a censure motion, brought by members of the EK, was approved, and Savisaar was elected to succeed him. These developments prompted Laar’s Government to resign on 8 January 2002. On 22 January Kallas of the ER was approved as Prime Minister of an interim, coalition government, which held fewer than one-half of the seats in the State Assembly.</p>
                         <p id="EE.IS.5460">Parliamentary elections were held on 2 March 2003, when the EK received 25.4% of the votes cast and 28 seats in the 101-member State Assembly. The conservative Res Publica party (founded in 2001) obtained 24.6% and 28 seats, and the ER took 17.7% and 19 seats; Eestimaa Rahvaliit, Isamaaliit and the RM also secured representation. The rate of participation by the electorate was 58.2%. Although the EK secured the largest number of votes cast, Res Publica, the ER and Eestimaa Rahvaliit reached agreement on the formation of an administration. Juhan Parts, the leader of Res Publica, formed a new coalition Government, which was approved in April. In September the Minister of Finance, Palts, resigned, after an investigation was initiated into allegations of tax evasion. In February 2004 the RM changed its name to the Sotsiaaldemokraatlik Erakond (SDE—Social Democratic Party).</p>

             in May 2004 (see 
            <i>Regional Relations</i>
            ), its first elections to the European Parliament took place in the following month. In October Savisaar resigned as Mayor of Tallinn, following a vote of no confidence in the City Council. He was replaced by Palts. In November Andrus Ansip, the Minister of the Economy and Communications, was elected Chairman of the ER, replacing Kallas, who had been appointed to the European Commission. In December the EK signed a co-operation agreement with the ruling party of the Russian Federation, Yedinaya Rossiya (United Russia); consequently, EK members who supported EU integration left the party, significantly reducing its faction in the State Assembly.
          </p>
                         <p id="EE.IS.68">In March 2005 Parts announced the resignation of his Government, and the EK, the ER and Eestimaa Rahvaliit agreed to form a coalition. Ansip was nominated as Prime Minister of a new Government, which was sworn in on 13 April. Local elections took place on 16 October (when, for the first time, voting was permitted online). The EK won 25.5% of the votes cast nationwide, followed by the ER, Eestimaa Rahvaliit and Isamaaliit. In November the EK’s Jüri Ratas was elected Mayor of Tallinn.</p>
                         <p>Following three inconclusive ballots in the State Assembly to elect a new President, an electoral college, which convened on 23 September 2006, voted for Ilves of the SDE, over Rüütel, by 174 votes to 162; Ilves was inaugurated on 9 October. Also in October Isamaaliit and Res Publica merged to form the Isamaa ja Res Publica Liit (IRL—Union of Pro Patria and Res Publica).</p>
                         <p>Legislative elections were held on 4 March 2007, with the participation of 61.9% of the electorate, when Estonia became the first country to introduce online voting at national legislative elections. The ER won 31 seats and 27.8% of the votes cast, followed by the EK, with 29 seats and 26.1% of the votes. The IRL secured 19 seats and 17.9% of the votes, and the SDE won 10 seats and 10.6%. The Eestimaa Rohelised (Estonian Greens) and Eestimaa Rahvaliit each obtained six seats and 7.1%. In late March the ER, the IRL and the SDE announced the formation of a centre-right coalition, commanding 60 of the 101 seats in the State Assembly. A new Government, again under the premiership of Ansip, was installed on 4 April. On the following day Savisaar was again elected as Mayor of Tallinn, replacing Ratas, who had been elected as a Vice-Speaker of the State Assembly.</p>
                         <p>Ansip dismissed the three SDE ministers from the governing coalition in May 2009, following disagreements about unemployment benefits and austerity proposals; the ER and the IRL remained in office as a minority administration. At elections to the European Parliament on 7 June, the EK obtained two of the country’s six seats. The ER, the IRL, the SDE and an independent candidate each took one seat. Voter turnout, at 43.9%, was markedly higher than in 2004. From December 2010 Savisaar, as both re-elected Mayor of Tallinn and Chairman of the EK, became the focus of a political scandal, after accusations that he had received illegal party donations, notably from the President of Russian Railways.</p>

Following an agreement between the ER and the IRL to continue their governing coalition, on 5 April Ansip appointed a new Government, in which several senior positions remained unchanged, and Laar was appointed Minister of Defence.</p>
                         <p>In August 2011 a member of the Eestimaa Ühendatud Vasakpartei (Estonian United Left Party), which sought to represent the interests of the Russian minority, attempted to take hostage staff at the Ministry of Defence in Tallinn. The gunman opened fire inside the building, before he was shot and killed by police officers. On 29 August Ilves was re-elected President by 73 votes in the State Assembly. In January 2012 Urmas Reinsalu was elected leader of the IRL, replacing Laar. In February Laar suffered a stroke, and in May Reinsalu also assumed responsibility for his ministerial defence portfolio. Meanwhile, in March Eestimaa Rahvaliit was renamed the Eesti Konservatiivne Rahvaerakond (EKRE—Estonian Conservative People’s Party).</p>

On 8 April the State Assembly approved the formation of a new coalition Government, comprising the ER, the SDE and the IRL, and led again by Rõivas. The Government took office on 9 April.</p>
                         <p>In June 2015 Rõivas survived a motion of no confidence in the State Assembly, linked to the Government’s tax reform proposals. At the beginning of July Pentus-Rosimannus resigned as Minister of Foreign Affairs, after a court ruled that she was liable, in part, for debts amassed by an insolvent company that had been owned by her father. Later in that month Marina Kaljurand was appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs. Savisaar was removed from his mayoral office by a court decision in September, following allegations of bribery. He remained Chairman of the EK, however, following a leadership contest in November.</p>
                         <p>Three rounds of voting in the State Assembly on 29-30 August 2016 failed to elect a presidential successor to Ilves. In early September Kaljurand resigned as Minister of Foreign Affairs, in order to contest the next poll, and was succeeded by Jürgen Ligi. However, after an electoral college was convened on 24 September, a further two rounds of voting were also inconclusive. On 30 September representatives of the major parliamentary parties nominated a consensus candidate, Kersti Kaljulaid, a former judge of the European Court of Auditors (ECA). On 3 October Kaljulaid, who was without party affiliation, was elected President with 81 votes. She was inaugurated on 10 October, becoming the first woman to hold the post.</p>

                         <p>On 5 November 2016 Ratas was elected to replace Savisaar as Chairman of the EK. Rõivas announced the resignation of his Government after losing a parliamentary vote of no confidence on 9 November. Ratas was sworn in as Prime Minister on 23 November, leading a coalition Government in which the EK, the SDE and the IRL each received five portfolios. Mikser was appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs, while IRL leader Margus Tsahkna became Minister of Defence, and Andres Anvelt of the SDE was appointed as Minister of the Interior.</p>
                         <p>In May 2017 Helir-Valdor Seeder was elected Chairman of the IRL, replacing Tsahkna, who, together with a further IRL parliamentary deputy, subsequently announced his resignation from the party. In a government reorganization in June, the three ministers from the IRL were replaced by new party representatives; notably, Toomas Tõniste was appointed as Minister of Finance, while Tsahkna was succeeded as Minister of Defence by Jüri Luik. Although Savisaar’s trial, on corruption charges, commenced in the same month, in December 2018 the Supreme Court ruled that criminal proceedings should be abandoned, owing to his poor health.</p>

            Municipal elections on 15 October 2017 marked the end of a process of administrative reform, under which the number of municipalities was reduced from 213 to 79 (after the Supreme Court overruled the complaints of municipal authorities that had contested their merger). In November Taavi Aas of the EK was elected as Mayor of Tallinn. In April 2018 Kaja Kallas, the daughter of former premier Siim Kallas, was elected as the new leader of the ER. On 26 November President Kaljulaid appointed Katri Raik of the SDE as Minister of the Interior, after Anvelt announced his resignation.

                         <p>Following legislative elections on 3 March 2019, the ER remained the first-placed party, securing 28.9% of the votes cast and 34 seats, while the governing EK obtained 23.1% of the votes and 26 seats; support for the populist EKRE strengthened significantly, to 17.8% and 19 seats (compared with seven seats in 2015), surpassing support for the Isamaa Erakond (Pro Patria Party—as the IRL had been renamed), with 11.4% and 12 seats, and the SDE, with 9.8% and 10 seats. The official rate of participation by the electorate was 63.7%.</p>
                         <p>President Kaljulaid initially nominated ER leader Kaja Kallas as premier, but she failed to secure sufficient parliamentary support to be endorsed in the post, and Kaljulaid invited outgoing Prime Minister Ratas to form a new administration. Ratas’s proposed coalition, which held 56 seats in the State Assembly, received parliamentary approval on 17 April 2019 and took office on 29 April. The EK, the Isamaa Erakond and the EKRE each received five ministerial posts. Reinsalu of the Isamaa Erakond became Minister of Foreign Affairs, while EKRE leader Mart Helme was appointed Minister of the Interior and his son, Martin Helme, became Minister of Finance. Mihhail Kõlvart of the EK was elected as Mayor of Tallinn, after Aas was appointed as Minister of Economic Affairs and Infrastructure.</p>
                         <p>Elections to the European Parliament took place on 26 May 2019, with a rate of participation of 37.6%. The ER was again the leading party, securing 26.2% of the votes and two seats, while the SDE obtained 23.3% of the votes and two seats. The EK won 14.4% of the votes and one seat, and the EKRE won 12.7% and the remaining seat.</p>
                         <p>After the first cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in Estonia, in March 2020 the Government declared a state of emergency, banning public gatherings and events and establishing border controls. The state of emergency was extended until mid-May.</p>

                         <p>In July 2020 Mart Helme was succeeded as leader of the EKRE by Martin Helme. On 9 November Mart Helme resigned as Minister of the Interior, after attracting criticism for comments that he had made during a radio broadcast, in which he criticized the conduct of the US presidential election in that month and described President-elect Joe Biden as corrupt. Alar Laneman assumed the interior portfolio in mid-November. Later in November Minister of Education and Research Mailis Reps resigned, following media reports that she had used her official vehicle for personal purposes. (Reps was charged with embezzlement in November 2021.)</p>
                         <p>On 13 January 2021 Ratas tendered the resignation of his Government. The Public Prosecutor’s Office had announced on the previous day that five individuals linked to the EK, including the party’s Secretary-General, Mihhail Korb, were suspected of corruption, after it emerged that a state loan worth €39m. had been granted to a real estate development project in Tallinn, allegedly in return for donations to party funds. (Andre Hanimägi was appointed Secretary-General of the EK, following Korb’s resignation.) President Kaljulaid officially invited ER leader Kaja Kallas to form a new administration. On 24 January it was announced that the ER and the EK had negotiated an agreement on a `grand coalition’, with 59 seats in the State Assembly. A new Government, comprising members of the two parties, as well as independents, took office on 26 January (Kallas thereby becoming the first woman to hold the post of Prime Minister in the country). Newly appointed ministers included Eva-Maria Liimets and Kristjan Jaani (both independents) as, respectively, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of the Interior, and Pentus-Rosimannus of the ER as Minister of Finance. In March Ratas was elected as Speaker of the State Assembly, succeeding Henn Põlluaas of the EKRE. Liimets and Jaani officially joined the EK in June.</p>
                         <p>The indirect election to the presidency in August 2021 prompted controversy, after the incumbent, Kaljulaid, failed to obtain the support of 21 deputies, required for nomination (following her previous criticism of government policies). After others, including Põlluaas and former minister Kaimar Karu, also failed to secure nomination, Director of the Estonian National Museum and former Auditor-General Alar Karis was invited by Ratas to seek election as a consensus candidate. He contested two rounds of voting unopposed, as an independent supported by the EK and the ER (the first time that a candidate had run unopposed since 1992). In a second round of voting on 31 August 2021, Karis was elected as President, with 72 votes cast in the State Assembly. He took office on 11 October.</p>
                         <p>Local elections, at which a voter turnout of 54.7% was recorded, took place on 11-17 October 2021. The share of the national vote obtained by the EK and the ER declined to 24.4% and 17.3%, respectively, while local electoral coalitions received 24.3% of the votes cast. In addition, the EK, with 45.4% of the votes and 38 seats, lost its longstanding majority on Tallinn City Council. However, in November the EK signed a coalition agreement with the SDE in Tallinn, and the incumbent Mayor, Kõlvart, was subsequently re-elected.</p>
                         <p>
            Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 (see 
            <i>Other External Relations</i>
            ) was formally condemned by the Estonian Government. On 26 February around 30,000 people demonstrated in Tallinn in support of Ukraine. On 3 March Tallinn City Council adopted a resolution condemning the Russian invasion, but a proposed addition to the text to identify Russian President Vladimir Putin as personally responsible as a war criminal was defeated. The Government announced in early March that people fleeing the conflict in Ukraine would be able to apply for temporary protection, under a simplified procedure, in Estonia.

                         <heading>Recent Developments: The 2023 Legislative Elections</heading>
                         <p>In June 2022 President Karis dismissed the seven representatives of the EK from the Government, after Kaja Kallas accused the traditionally pro-Russian party of undermining Estonia’s values and failing to protect Estonian independence, following the invasion of Ukraine. In late June Liina Kersna of the ER resigned as Minister of Education and Research, after criminal proceedings were initiated about public procurement arrangements for the supply of COVID-19 tests for schools during a surge in infections in late 2021. After inter-party negotiations, on 14 July Kallas announced the resignation of the Government; on the following day she secured a parliamentary mandate for the formation of a new governing coalition comprising the ER, Isamaa and the SDE. Her new Government, which took office four days later, was to remain in place until parliamentary elections due to take place in March 2023. Pentus-Rosimannus tendered her resignation as Minister of Finance in October 2022, after being nominated as Estonia’s representative at the ECA; she was replaced by Anneli Akkermann, also of the ER.</p>
                         <p>The legislative elections took place on 5 March 2023, amid a cost of living crisis and public controversy about the substantial military assistance provided by the Government to Ukraine. The ER nevertheless secured victory, with 31.2% of the votes cast and 37 seats in the State Assembly (three more than previously), defeating the challenge presented by the EKRE, which obtained 16.1% of the votes and 17 seats. The EK received 15.3% of the votes and 16 seats, while Eesti 200 (Estonia 200—a liberal party formed in 2018) gained parliamentary representation for the first time, with 13.3% of the votes and 14 seats. The SDE took 9.3% of the votes and nine seats, and Isamaa 8.2% of the votes and eight. The rate of participation by the electorate was 63.5%. Shortly afterwards, Kaja Kallas engaged in negotiations with Eesti 200 and the SDE to form a new government coalition, which was sworn in on 17 April. In addition to the post of Prime Minister, the ER was awarded six ministries, and the SDE and Eesti 200 each received three cabinet posts. Notably, Urmas Reinsalu was replaced as Minister of Foreign Affairs by Margus Tsahkna. The leader of Eesti 200, Lauri Hussar, was elected as Chairman of the State Assembly.</p>
                         <p>Under the coalition agreement, the Government sought to increase defence expenditure from 2.5% of gross domestic product to 3.0% during 2024-27. However, the announcement of plans to introduce tax increases reportedly reduced popular support for the new administration. On 20 June Estonia became the first former Soviet state to approve legislation recognizing same-sex marriages; the legislation, which also permitted same-sex couples to adopt, entered into force in January 2024.</p>
                         <p>Meanwhile, in August 2023 Estonia’s public broadcaster, ERR, alleged that, despite demands by Kallas for the imposition of stringent economic sanctions on trade with Russia, a logistics company part-owned by her husband Arvo Hallik had profited from business involving that country. Although it was confirmed that the company had not operated in breach of existing sanctions, Hallik disposed of his stake in the business. Kallas denied any involvement in her husband’s business activities and resisted opposition demands for her resignation.</p>

            Estonia pursues close relations with its Baltic neighbours, Latvia and Lithuania. In late 1991 the three states established a consultative interparliamentary body, the Baltic Assembly, with the aim of developing political and economic co-operation. The Baltic Assembly has maintained close links with the Nordic Council, and Estonia is also a member of the 
            <xr pageref="Y" ref="CBSS.IO">Council of the Baltic Sea States</xr>
            , established in 1992. In January 2007 the Baltic states agreed to establish a joint Baltic battalion (under Lithuanian command) to participate in the 
            <xr pageref="Y" ref="NATO.IO">North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)</xr>
             Response Force from January 2010; a NATO Force Integration Unit in Estonia was inaugurated in mid-2015. Meanwhile, meeting in Vilnius, Lithuania, in 2009, the three Baltic Prime Ministers signed a declaration on the implementation of joint energy infrastructure projects, and the countries established a common Nordic-Baltic energy market in 2013, under the EU’s 2009 Baltic Energy Market Interconnection Plan; the project, which was designed to create an integrated European electricity market, was formally launched in 2014, and is due to be completed by February 2025. Moreover, in February 2014 the combined region entered into a single energy trading market encompassing 15 countries, with the completion in that month of the 650-MW Estlink II undersea interconnector cable between Estonia and Finland being an important development. In January 2017 the Prime Ministers of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania met EU officials in Tallinn and signed a trilateral agreement on the development of the Rail Baltica, with EU funding, to connect the Baltic states and Central European railway networks. 
            <!--https://news.err.ee/1018258/err-news-looks-back-at-2019-in-estonia-->
            Construction of the Rail Baltica main line began in November 2019. The opening of an undersea gas pipeline (known as the Balticconnector) between Estonia and Finland was marked by a ceremony in December. In October 2023 the Estonian and Finnish Governments jointly claimed that the Balticconnector had been sabotaged, following reports of a leak. The critical undersea infrastructure was closed while repairs were carried out. In December the Finnish authorities identified a Chinese container ship that they suspected of having damaged the pipeline. Finland and Estonia requested the assistance of the Chinese authorities in investigating the incident.

                         <p id="EE.IS.39">Following the restoration of Estonian independence in 1991, the country’s relations with Russia were strained by several issues, notably the rights of the large Russian minority in Estonia. At the dissolution of the USSR at the end of 1991, several thousand former Soviet troops remained stationed (under Russian command) on Estonian territory. Their withdrawal was completed in August 1994, following a bilateral agreement reached in July, awarding civil and social guarantees to Russian military pensioners in Estonia.</p>
                         <p>Under the Citizenship Law of 1992, non-ethnic Estonians who settled in the republic after its annexation by the USSR in 1940, and their descendants, had to apply for naturalization. A new citizenship law, adopted in January 1995, introduced more demanding requirements for naturalization, and some residents of Estonia opted instead to take Russian citizenship. In April 2000, following a statement by the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities that language legislation adopted in the previous year contravened international standards, the law was amended, to make knowledge of Estonian compulsory only where it was deemed necessary for the sake of public interest.</p>
                         <p id="EE.IS.41">A further cause of tension in Estonian-Russian relations concerned Estonia’s demand for the return of some 2,000 sq&#160;km (770 sq miles) of territory that had been ceded to Russia in 1944. In 1995 Estonia abandoned its demand for the return of the disputed territories but insisted that Russia recognize the 1920 Treaty of Tartu (in which Russia recognized Estonia’s independence). However, the Russian Government maintained that the treaty had been superseded by the declaration on bilateral relations signed by Russia and Estonia in 1991. In September 2000, as part of the country’s preparations for EU membership, Estonia decreed that from 2001 a full visa regime would come into effect for Russian citizens.</p>
                         <p>In May 2005 the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Estonia and Russia signed a new border agreement. However, the addition of a preamble making reference to the Soviet occupation of Estonia caused Russia to revoke the agreement and demand renewed negotiations. The approval in February 2007 of legislation providing for the relocation of a Soviet war monument in Tallinn, together with a proposed law to ban politically motivated public displays of Soviet and Nazi symbols in Estonia, further antagonized the Russian Government. When the monument was dismantled, in April, pending its relocation, days of rioting ensued in Tallinn, as a result of which at least one person was killed and several hundred injured; some 800 people were arrested.</p>
                         <p>Following an easing in tensions, President Ilves attended Russia’s Victory Day parade (commemorating the end of the Second World War) in the capital Moscow on 9 May 2010. The first visit of an Estonian Prime Minister to Russia in over a decade took place in April 2013. Meanwhile, in October 2012 Estonia’s State Assembly agreed to a proposal by Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov for the resumption of border treaty negotiations. In February 2014 the Estonian Minister of Foreign Affairs met Lavrov in Moscow, and a revised border agreement was signed. However, Russia’s annexation of the Crimean peninsula in March and the involvement of Russian military personnel in the subsequent conflict in eastern Ukraine prompted a deterioration in Russia’s relations with the West and heightened concerns in the Baltic states. Meanwhile, the State Assembly suspended ratification of the border treaty until the Russian legislature also initiated its ratification process. An Estonian security service officer was detained by Russian troops in September, on the grounds that he had crossed the border illegally. In September 2015 he was returned to Estonia, following the release by the Estonian authorities of a former security officer who had been found guilty of espionage on behalf of Russia.</p>
                         <p>
            In May 2017 the Estonian authorities expelled two Russian diplomats based at the Russian consulate in Narva, apparently owing to their contacts with local officials, after which Russia declared two Estonian diplomats 
            <i>personae non gratae</i>
            . In December an Estonian businessman involved in aviation technology, Raivo Susi, who had been arrested at a Moscow airport in early 2016, was sentenced to 12 years’ imprisonment on charges of espionage. However, in February 2018 Susi was released in exchange for the release by the Estonian authorities of a Russian national (who had been sentenced to five years’ imprisonment on charges of spying for Russia). In September an Estonian former defence officer, Maj. Deniss Metsavas, and his father were detained at the order of a Tallinn court on suspicion of providing state secrets and classified information to Russia’s military intelligence agency. In February 2019 Metsavas was sentenced to 15.5 years in prison and his father to a term of six years.

                         <p>
            In April 2019 President Kaljulaid made an official visit to Russia to attend the opening of the renovated Estonian embassy in Moscow, subsequently meeting President Putin. However, at the beginning of 2020 Russian state-controlled news agency Sputnik announced the closure of its operations in Estonia (which had broadcast in both Russian and Estonian), after some 35 employees resigned, in response to a warning from Estonian police that they might be subject to prosecution, owing to the EU sanctions in force against Russia. Following a disputed presidential election in Belarus in August and the ensuing state repression of opposition protests in the country, at the end of the month Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania imposed travel bans on President Alyaksandr Lukashenka and 29 other Belarusian officials (prior to EU agreement on collective sanctions). The three countries extended the travel bans to a further 98 Belarusian officials in September. In February 2021 the Russian Government declared an Estonian diplomat 
            <i>persona non grata</i>
            , following the expulsion of a Russian embassy official from Estonia. Following the Czech Republic’s expulsion in April of 18 Russian diplomats over suspicions of Russian military intelligence involvement in an explosion in the country in 2014, the Estonian Government summoned the Russian ambassador and expelled one Russian diplomat, in a demonstration of solidarity co-ordinated with similar action in Latvia and Lithuania. Shortly afterwards, Russia expelled a further Estonian diplomat in reprisal. In July 2021 Russia announced the expulsion of an Estonian diplomat based in St Petersburg, who was accused of `receiving classified materials’; the Estonian foreign ministry dismissed the allegations and subsequently expelled a Russian diplomat in response. However, in November Estonia and Russia held political consultations on bilateral relations in Tallinn, attended by representatives of the respective foreign ministries.
          </p>
                         <p>On 23 February 2022 (one day before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine), Estonia’s State Assembly adopted a statement (although several EK deputies abstained) that strongly condemned Russian aggression against Ukraine. In April the legislatures in Estonia and Latvia voted unanimously to recognize the killing of civilians by Russian forces in occupied areas of Ukraine as genocide. In October the State Assembly (following similar resolutions adopted by the legislatures of Latvia and Lithuania earlier in that year) adopted a statement declaring Russia a `terrorist regime’. In January 2023 the Estonian Government expelled a further 13 Russian diplomats and eight Russian embassy technical staff (reducing their number to the level of Estonian embassy staff in Moscow); in retaliation, Russia announced the downgrading of its relations with Estonia and ordered its ambassador to leave the country, after which Estonia expelled the Russian ambassador. In March Russia imposed sanctions on 144 citizens of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, in reprisal for the three states’ support for more stringent EU sanctions against Russia. In November Russia and Belarus vetoed Estonia’s application to assume the rotating chairmanship of the OSCE in 2024. In December 2023 Estonia completed the construction of a 40-km fence along its border with Russia, as part of efforts to prevent that country from directing flows of foreign migrants towards its border with Estonia; Russia had been accused by a number of European countries of efforts to `weaponize’ immigration. In mid-January 2024 it was reported that Estonia refused to renew the residence permit of Metropolitan Eugene, the Russian head of the Estonian Orthodox Church, following his public statements in support of Russia; he was required to leave the country by early February. In mid-February it was reported that Russia sought to impose criminal charges against Prime Minister Kallas owing to government efforts to remove Soviet monuments in Estonia. Subsequently, on 12 March Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs published a list of Baltic politicians who were prohibited from entering Russian territory. The list included 10 prominent Estonian politicians, including Kallas and Minister of Foreign Affairs Tsahkna.</p>
                         <p id="EE.IS.44">A national referendum on EU membership was held in September 2003, with the participation of 64.1% of the electorate, in which 66.8% of votes were cast in favour of Estonia’s accession. Estonia became a full member of the EU on 1 May 2004, and in December 2007 it implemented the EU’s Schengen Agreement, enabling its citizens to travel to and from other signatory states without border controls. Meanwhile, in June 2004 Estonia was admitted to the exchange rate mechanism (ERM-II) as a precursor to adopting the common European currency. In July 2010 EU ministers of finance endorsed Estonia’s admission to the eurozone, after the European Commission announced that the necessary economic criteria had been met. In January 2011 Estonia became the first Baltic state to adopt the euro.</p>

                         <p>In November 2002, at a NATO summit meeting held in Prague, Czech Republic, Estonia was one of seven countries to be invited formally to accede to the Alliance, and it became a full member on 29 March 2004. A NATO air policing mission was initiated in 2004 over the Baltic states. In November 2006 US President George&#160;W. Bush became the first US Head of State to visit Estonia. In June 2007 President Ilves made an official visit to the USA, during which President Bush endorsed the Estonian Government’s proposal for the establishment of a NATO cyber defence research centre in Tallinn, with US participation. In May 2008 the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence was established in Tallinn.</p>
                         <p>
            Following the Russian annexation of Crimea in March 2014 (see 
            <i>Regional Relations</i>
            ), NATO member states for the first time deployed fighter aircraft at the newly opened Ämari airbase in Estonia as part of its Baltic air-policing mission. As part of NATO plans to establish an expanded rapid reaction force, NATO command centres were installed in Estonia and other Eastern European states in mid-2015. The Estonian Government welcomed the decision adopted at a NATO summit meeting in Warsaw, Poland, in July 2016 to deploy four multinational battalions, respectively, to the Baltic states and Poland, with the aim of deterring potential Russian aggression. In January 2017 Estonia signed a Defence Co-operation Agreement with the USA that formalized the presence of US forces in the country. In February US troops and equipment were deployed in Estonia (and other Eastern European states) on a rotational basis, under Operation Atlantic Resolve (which had been initiated in mid-2014 to demonstrate US commitment to collective security among NATO member states). British troops began to arrive in Estonia in March 2017, as part of the deployment of a NATO battalion at the Tapa base, east of Tallinn.

            In response to sharply escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine, in January 2022 Prime Minister Kaja Kallas argued in favour of a strong Western stance and reinforced NATO presence in Estonia and the other Baltic states. In a joint statement issued on 21 January, the defence ministers of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania announced the provision of US-manufactured weaponry to the Ukrainian Government. The first consignment of anti-tank missile systems donated by Estonia arrived in Ukraine on 18 February. Meanwhile, in mid-February the British defence ministry confirmed that additional troops and military equipment would be dispatched to Estonia. Shortly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, a new contingent of British troops (to number around 850) began to arrive in Estonia. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Estonia in March, when he provided assurances of NATO support for the Baltic states against Russian aggression. At November 2023 the NATO battlegroup at Tata had a total strength of around 1,350 personnel, principally from the United Kingdom and France. In June of that year Prime Minister Kallas expressed support for Ukraine’s eventual membership of NATO, and also supported the convening of the NATO-Ukraine Council, a new format for bilateral consultations, in July. Prime Minister Kallas continued to urge NATO to strengthen its defence capabilities in the region in order to deter potential Russian aggression directed against the Baltic states. Following damage to the critical Balticconnector pipeline (see 
            <i>Regional Relations</i>
            ) in October, NATO intensified surveillance and reconnaissance flights in the area. By January 2024 Estonia had provided Ukraine with military aid worth around €500m. In that month Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania agreed to establish a common Baltic defence zone at their borders with Russia and Belarus.

        A new Constitution, based on that of 1938, was adopted by a referendum held on 28 June 1992 and took effect on 3 July. Legislative authority resides with the Riigikogu (State Assembly), which has 101 members, elected by universal adult suffrage for a four-year term. The State Assembly elects the President (head of state) for a term of five years. The President is also Supreme Commander of Estonia’s armed forces. Executive power is held by the Council of Ministers, which is led by the Prime Minister, who is nominated by the President. Judicial power is exercised by the Supreme Court, district courts and rural and city, as well as administrative, courts. For admin­istra­tive purposes, Estonia is divided into 15 counties (
        <i>maakonds</i>
        ), which are subdivided into cities, rural municipalities and towns. In 2016-17 a process of administrative reform was undertaken, whereby municipalities comprising less than 5,000 people (around 80% of total municipalities) were merged. Upon completion of the reform process in October 2017, the country’s municipalities (previously totalling 213) had been reduced in number to 79.

               <p id="EE.IS.50">In 2022, according to World Bank estimates, Estonia’s gross national income (GNI), measured at average 2020-22 prices, was US&#160;$37,175m., equivalent to $27,640 per head (or $46,080 per head on an international purchasing-power parity basis). During 2013-22, according to World Bank estimates, the population increased at an average annual rate of 0.2%, while gross domestic product (GDP) per head increased, in real terms, by an average of 2.8% per year. Overall GDP increased, in real terms, at an average annual rate of 3.0% during 2013-22, according to the World Bank; real GDP increased by 8.0% in 2021, but decreased by 1.3% in 2022. According to chain-linking methodologies, GDP increased by 7.2% in 2021, but decreased by 0.5% in 2022.</p>
               <p id="EE.IS.51">Agriculture (including forestry and fishing) contributed 2.8% of GDP and engaged 2.6% of the employed labour force in 2022. Animal husbandry is the main activity in the agricultural sector. A total of 27.4% of Estonia’s land is cultivable. The principal crops are wheat, barley, rapeseed, oats, potatoes and fruit and vegetables. Forestry products are also important. During 2013-22, according to World Bank estimates, agricultural GDP declined, in real terms, at an average annual rate of 3.6%; real GDP in the sector decreased by 24.9% in 2022.</p>
               <p id="EE.IS.52">Industry (including mining and quarrying, manufacturing, construction and utilities) contributed 27.1% of GDP and engaged 28.8% of the employed labour force in 2022. During 2013-22, according to World Bank estimates, real industrial GDP increased, in real terms, at an average annual rate of 2.3%; industrial GDP increased by 7.1% in 2021, but decreased by 3.0% in 2022.</p>
               <p id="EE.IS.53">Mining and quarrying contributed 0.6% of GDP and engaged 0.5% of the employed labour force in 2022. Estonia’s principal mineral resource is oil shale, and there are also deposits of peat, phosphorite ore, limestone and granite. There are total estimated reserves of oil shale of some 4,000m. metric tons. Extraction of oil shale was 13.8m. tons in 2022. Phosphorite ore is processed to produce phosphates for use in agriculture, but development of the industry has been accompanied by increasing environmental problems. According to chain-linking methodologies, the GDP of the mining and quarrying sector increased by 2.8% in 2021, but decreased by 22.4% in 2022.</p>
               <p id="EE.IS.54">The manufacturing sector accounted for 14.9% of GDP and engaged 18.2% of the employed labour force in 2022. The sector is based on products of food and beverage processing (especially dairy products), textiles and clothing, fertilizers and other chemical products, and wood and timber products (particularly furniture). According to World Bank estimates, in 2013-22 the GDP of the manufacturing sector increased, in real terms, at an average annual rate of 2.5%; real manufacturing GDP increased by 6.8% in 2021 and by just 0.1% in 2022. Manufacturing GDP increased by 11.0% in 2021 and by 0.8% in 2022, according to chain-linking methodologies.</p>
               <p id="EE.IS.2008">The construction sector contributed 6.7% of GDP and engaged 8.6% of the employed labour force in 2022. According to chain-linking methodologies, sectoral GDP increased by 5.2% in 2021 and by 0.2% in 2022.</p>
               <p id="EE.IS.55">The country relies on oil shale for over 90% of its energy requirements, so it is self-sufficient in terms of electricity generation and is a net exporter of electrical energy. Estlink, an under-sea electrical cable connecting the electricity networks of Estonia and Finland, became operational in January 2007 and has provided an additional source of revenue through the export of power; a second undersea cable between Estonia and Finland entered into operation in early 2014. An undersea gas pipeline (known as the Balticconnector) between Estonia and Finland opened in December 2019. In 2022 imports of mineral fuels accounted for 19.1% of total imports.</p>
               <p id="EE.IS.56">The services sector accounted for 70.0% of GDP and engaged 68.6% of the employed population in 2022. According to World Bank estimates, during 2013-22 the GDP of the services sector increased, in real terms, at an average annual rate of 3.5%; the GDP of the sector increased by 8.2% in 2021 and by 0.1% in 2022.</p>
               <p id="EE.IS.57">In 2022 Estonia recorded a visible merchandise trade deficit of US&#160;$2,702.6m., and there was a deficit of $1,230.9m. on the current account of the balance of payments. In 2022 Finland was Estonia’s principal source of imports, accounting for 16.9% of the total. Other important sources of imports were Lithuania, Germany, Latvia, the Russian Federation, Sweden and Poland. In that year Finland was also the principal export trading partner, accounting for 14.5% of exports. Latvia, Sweden, Lithuania, Germany and the USA were other important purchasers of exports. In 2022 the principal exports were machinery, mechanical and electrical appliances, mineral products, wood and articles of wood, base metals and articles of base metal, miscellaneous manufactured articles, and vehicles and related transport equipment. The principal imports in that year were machinery, mechanical and electrical appliances, mineral products, vehicles and related transport equipment, base metals and articles of base metal, and chemical products.</p>
               <p id="EE.IS.58">According to official figures, a budgetary deficit of €1,229m. was forecast for 2023. Estonia’s general government gross debt was €6,658m. in 2022, equivalent to 18.5% of GDP. According to official figures, during 2013-22 the annual rate of inflation averaged 3.6%. Consumer prices increased by 4.5% in 2021 and by 19.4% in 2022. In 2022 the rate of unemployment was 5.6%, according to official figures.</p>

        Estonia has been a member of the eurozone since 2011 and has developed a significant role in the information and communications technology sector within the

        . An innovative `e-residency’ programme, launched by the Government in 2014, allowed non-Estonian entrepreneurs access to services such as company formation and banking for a state fee of €100. (However, in January 2023 the Council of Europe’s anti-money laundering committee, Moneyval, criticized the programme.) Estonia’s reputation with regard to financial governance was damaged after a 2018 report confirmed allegations of large-scale money laundering at the Estonian branch of the Danish Danske Bank, which subsequently ended operations in Estonia. Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, a supplementary budget was approved in April 2020, providing for wide-ranging measures, amounting to some €2,000m., to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic for workers and companies. In Oc
        
        tober 2021 the Council of the EU endorsed an allocation of €969.3m. in grants to Estonia during 2021-26, under the EU’s recovery and resilience plan. After entering recession in 2020, GDP growth in Estonia recovered in 2021. However, the impact of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, together with the ensuing Western sanctions imposed against Russia, halted economic recovery. Estonia recorded a dramatic rise in the rate of domestic inflation to 19.4% in 2022 (much higher than the average for the eurozone), driven by increases in energy and food costs. Estonia again entered recession in the third quarter of 2022, and GDP contracted by 0.5% overall in that year. Despite political instability and the cost of living crisis, the Eesti Reformierakond (Estonian Reform Party) led by Kaja Kallas was returned to office at elections in March. A new Government took office in April, pledging in its coalition agreement to implement efforts to achieve a balanced state budget while increasing expenditure on defence to 3.0% of GDP. The Government announced its intention to increase the rate of value-added tax from 20% to 22% in 2024, and income tax was similarly to increase from 20% to 22% in 2025; a car tax was to be introduced from 1 July 2024 (Estonia had hitherto been the only EU member state not to tax drivers). The rate of increase in consumer prices declined to 9.2% in 2023, according to official figures. Although GDP contracted by 2.3% in 2023, according to the International Monetary Fund, it estimated that GDP would return to growth in 2024 at a rate of some 2.4%.
