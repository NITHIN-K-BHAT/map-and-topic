          <heading>Introduction</heading>
          <p>Internationally, any mention of Greece since the late 2000s has evoked thoughts of `the crisis’, the combination of economic dysfunction and political instability that repeatedly threatened to disrupt, or even reverse, decades of integration with the wider European continent. The global financial crisis of the late 2000s was the catalyst for a troubled decade for Greece in the 2010s, from which it has just begun to emerge.</p>
          <p>During the 15 years preceding the economic crisis that emerged in Greece in 2009, the Greek economy experienced rapid economic growth. The Government in office from April 2000 sought to develop Greece’s infrastructure while economic times were relatively good, with projects such as the Athens Metro and the city’s new airport coming to fruition under its leadership. At the same time, macroeconomic figures were improving, despite this stimulus spending, with inflation declining and the budget deficit falling to almost 3% of gross domestic product (GDP)—the crucial limit required under the Maastricht Treaty for adoption of the European single currency. The European Union (EU) announced that Greece had passed its evaluation for admission to the eurozone, and that it would join in January 2001, two years after the founder members had established the new unit, and one year before the currency’s banknotes and coins were launched. On 1 January 2001 Greece duly became the 12th member state of the EU to adopt the common European currency, the euro. However, there were concerns over the reliability of Greek data and the strength of its economy, and an EU investigation team in 2004 revealed that the Government had supplied false figures relating to its deficit prior to joining the euro. Greece’s budget deficit prior to joining the euro was recalculated at 3.1%, narrowly over the limit of the EU’s convergence criteria (or Maastricht criteria) for admission to the eurozone. However, the popular international idea that Greece had been discovered to have massively falsified its statistics, with the assistance of US investment banks, is misplaced—Greece only missed its target by 0.07 of a percentage point, as had other countries; still further countries had made the same accounting error; and while Greece did subsequently conceal some of its budget deficit with currency exchanges effected by investment banks, this was during Prime Minister Konstantinos Simitis’s second term in office and after its admission to the euro area.</p>
          <p>The cost of the successful Summer Olympic Games, held in Athens in August 2004, placed serious strains on public finances: the new Government of Konstantinos Karamanlis, which took office in March, cited these costs specifically when introducing an austerity budget in March 2005, when value-added tax and other consumption taxes were increased.</p>
          <p>Over the coming years, rising unemployment and ongoing austerity led to protests and social unrest, and by mid-2009 the impact of the international economic financial crisis that first emerged with financial turbulence in the USA in late 2007 was felt in Greece. Between 2007 and 2010 real GDP and GDP per head in Greece declined by around 8% and 9%, respectively, while in 2010-13 they further declined, by some 17% and 16%. In total, the deep recession would inflict damage representing about one-quarter of Greek GDP. Consecutive Greek governments were subsequently compelled to focus efforts on tackling a burgeoning budgetary deficit, through increased tax revenues and reductions in expenditure, in co-operation with international institutions (principally the so-called troika, comprising the International Monetary Fund—IMF, the European Commission and the European Central Bank—ECB) to implement structural reforms in an effort to bring about longer-term financial and economic sustainability.</p>

          <heading>The Economic Crisis</heading>
          <p>The Government of Georgios Papandreou, elected in October 2009, invited a new EU investigation team to the country shortly after taking office; this mission discovered that data supplied by the previous Government, including the main deficit figures for several years, had been the subject of manipulation. The global financial system relies on the quality of the data that it receives, and a loss of confidence in Greek figures meant a loss of confidence in the Greek economy, already struggling with the second highest ratio of debt to GDP in Europe (after Italy). In late December 2009 an austerity budget was adopted by Parliament, prompting a series of public protests, as well as a national strike. In February 2010 police used tear gas forcibly to disperse a group of rioting protesters, following a demonstration in Athens attended by up to 25,000 people. Further general strikes and protests against the austerity plans took place throughout the first half of the year. In early March Parliament adopted a package of spending reductions and tax increases, precipitating further protests. In early May 2010 Papandreou was forced to agree to a package of €110,000m. in emergency assistance loans from the troika, outlined in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).</p>
          <p>Within a year, by mid-2011, it had become obvious that further foreign financial assistance would be needed, and that a default, or at least a major restructuring, was also likely. Papandreou introduced a new austerity plan to try to restore confidence, although EU governments reluctant to offer further aid to Greece swiftly made implementation of this plan a condition of further disbursements. Concerns that Greece would fall victim to a `disorderly’ or `hard’ default on its debt (that is, an immediate cessation of payments with no `write-downs’ or rescheduling agreed) escalated. It is at this point that mainstream economists, analysts and banks began to view the Greek crisis as a possible threat to the existence of the euro.</p>
          <p>A summit of eurozone leaders in late October 2011 produced a new fiscal plan for Greece. Papandreou initially professed a commitment to implementing the plan, despite its widespread unpopularity among his electorate, but days later announced that he intended to submit it for approval at a national referendum. This caused dismay elsewhere in Europe, and put significant pressure on the eurozone as a whole. After the opposition expressed support for the troika’s proposals, the plan for referendum was abandoned and Papandreou was ultimately forced to resign in favour of an interim cross-party administration, led by Lucas Papademos, a former ECB Vice-President. Nevertheless, the new Government’s policies were almost identical, with a fundamental short-term aim of adopting the measures agreed at the eurozone summit in order to secure a second bailout, and negotiating orderly debt write-downs with major private sector creditors. By now, the unemployment rate exceeded 15%, and more than one-half of those aged under 26 were out of work.</p>
          <p>In February 2012 the Greek legislature approved a further series of austerity measures. By successfully completing a restructuring of its debt in the following month, the country met another core condition for the second financial assistance package (valued at some €130,000m.) to be released. However, the continued adherence to the terms of the MOU amid significant social troubles was the principal issue of both election campaigns that were conducted in the first half of 2012. Legislative elections in June (following the failure to form a governing coalition after elections held in May) were presented as a decision on membership of the eurozone for the Greek elect­or­ate, with the alliance of left-wing forces opposed to the MOU likely to precipitate Greece’s eventual exit—in part owing to the political clamour in northern Europe that would have resulted from perceived extremists coming to power, but also in no small part because of their own policies, which appeared to underplay the gravity of Greece’s fiscal situation and urge a return to pre-crisis levels of spending.</p>
          <p>The parties of the coalition Government that emerged from the second elections, led by Antonis Samaras, all campaigned on a renegotiation of the bailout terms, although Samaras soon found that the creditor European nations, headed by Germany, were unwilling to engage in any significant renegotiation. A seventh austerity package, necessitating an increase in the retirement age, as well as further reductions in pensions and in public sector salaries, was approved in November 2012, and formalized in another austerity budget one month later. With progress during the second half of 2012 on issues such as tax collection, leading to a sharp reduction in the deficit, by the end of the year Greece was running a primary surplus, and talk of a `Grecovery’ had succeeded that of a `Grexit’.</p>
          <p>With other, larger economies such as Spain seriously imperilled by the eurozone crisis by mid-2012, the fear of `contagion’ if Greece were to default and be forced out of the eurozone started to recede, on the grounds that circumstances were already so bad elsewhere that such a shock in Greece could hardly make them worse. Fortunately, July 2012 had marked a turning point in the crisis. The President of the ECB, Mario Draghi, while announcing a new bond-buying scheme to assist the Spanish and Italian positions in the markets, stated that his office would do everything possible to protect the euro in its existing form. This announcement was initially dismissed by commentators, but before long its implications became clear. The ECB and the EU were not going to allow the weakest of the group of states to fail; there was a determination to maintain the euro as the currency for all its members, not to resolve its problems by losing states.</p>
          <p>Combined with the first sets of positive economic data coming from Greece and other countries that had been notably short on such news for several years (primary surpluses, the first signs of positive growth), and the start of more robust figures at the eurozone’s core, the threat of Greece precipitating a collapse began to fade. In July 2013 international lenders agreed to the disbursement of €4,800m. in aid to Greece, after the Government agreed to implement further large-scale public sector dismissals demanded by the troika; Greece was to receive a further €2,000m. from national central banks and the ECB. Greece registered positive economic growth in the last quarter of 2013, for the first time in four years. Ratings agencies even upgraded Greek sovereign debt slightly. Although painfully slow, and always accompanied by social protests against the continuing impact of austerity, Greece’s recovery emerged throughout 2013 and the first half of 2014, as Samaras’ unlikely coalition clung to power (with a government reorganization taking place in June). With interest rates on sovereign debt low, Greece was even able to return to the bond markets in 2014. The worst of the crisis appeared to be over.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, the failure to find parliamentary support for Samaras’s proposed candidate for the presidency after three rounds of voting in the legislature resulted in the dissolution of Parliament at the end of 2014, and the scheduling of early legislative elections for 25 January 2015. The election of a Government led by the far left Synaspismos Rizospastikís Aristeras (SYRIZA—Coalition of the Radical Left), in coalition with a rightist anti-austerity party, led to attempts to renegotiate the existing bailout agreement; the new Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, initially pledged to reverse some of the previous austerity measures, including privatizations, a reduction in the minimum wage and the dismissal of public sector workers. In early February the ECB announced that it would no longer accept Greek bonds in exchange for loans, thereby obliging Greece’s central bank to finance the country’s banks, resulting in a dramatic rise in government borrowing costs. Under increased pressure, in late February eurozone ministers responsible for finance approved revised policy measures presented by the Government, and Greece was granted a four-month extension of its bailout programme, thereby averting an imminent Greek debt default or exit from the eurozone. However, the disbursement of further funds was subject to agreement on reform implementation, and little progress was made in lengthy ongoing negotiations with eurozone ministers responsible for finance. Greece’s reserves were critically depleted following a debt repayment to the IMF in April, and Greece eventually failed to meet its obligations, defaulting on a repayment to the IMF in June (the largest economy to do so).</p>
          <p>Following the Greek default, banks were closed for 20 days and capital controls were imposed (with a €60 daily limit on cash withdrawals and the prohibition of foreign transfers). A referendum held in Greece on 5 July resulted in a majority vote against accepting the austerity measures demanded by the international creditors. As opposition throughout the EU to the new Greek Government increased, the principles of economic union were severely tested, and by mid-2015 the SYRIZA Government had changed the course of the Greek recovery, with the likelihood of Grexit being widely perceived to have increased significantly. However, Tsipras interpreted the referendum result as a renewal of his mandate, and returned to the negotiating table. On 8 July Greece made a formal request for additional lending under the EU’s European Stability Mechanism (ESM). With the Greek legislature’s eventual approval of EU conditions for a new programme of lending (despite IMF concerns regarding the sustainability of Greece’s debt), in mid-August the Board of Governors of the ESM approved fresh lending to Greece, worth up to €86,000m. over a period of three years, and the fears of Grexit again abated. Although controls began to be relaxed during July, some remained in place until September 2019, despite an otherwise improved economic position. On 20 August 2015 the ESM Board of Directors authorized the first tranche of lending, worth €26,000m. (of which €16,000m. was to be used for financing the budget and servicing debt, and the remainder was allocated to fund possible bank recapitalization). However, many SYRIZA deputies refused to support the agreement. The Government duly resigned, with Tsipras scheduling new legislative elections for September.</p>
          <p>With SYRIZA securing re-election on 15 September 2015 Tsipras took the helm as premier of a renewed coalition Government, with Euclid Tsakalotos, who had been appointed Minister of Finance following the resignation of controversial Minister of Finance Yannis Varoufakis in July, retaining his post. New austerity reforms were approved in November and in late December the ESM approved the disbursement of the final €1,000m. of the initial €16,000m. loan tranche approved in August, after disbursing €5,400m. to recapitalize banks earlier in the month. However, in early 2016 government plans to introduce social security reforms, with increases to both taxes and pension contributions, resulted in widely observed strike action. There were protests too against the partial privatization of the Piraeus Port Authority, and the pensions reforms remained contentious. In mid-2016 the ESM Board of Directors authorized the second tranche of lending under the third bailout agreement, totalling €10,300m., with the immediate disbursal of the first part, totalling €7,500m.; a second disbursement, worth €2,800m. was disbursed to Greece in November, following the approval of new structural reforms in October. On 5 December eurozone Ministers of Finance, meeting in Brussels, Belgium, endorsed an ESM plan of short-term measures to reduce Greece’s debt costs. In mid-December, however, the debt relief measures were temporarily suspended after Tsipras announced the extension of one-off social benefits to pensioners and the freezing of planned tax increases for several Aegean islands owing to the economic difficulties incurred in responding to a crisis prompted by a surge in irregular migration (precipitated in part by ongoing conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic).</p>
          <p>In mid-2017 eurozone Ministers of Finance, at a meeting attended by Managing Director of the IMF Christine Lagarde, reached agreement in principle on the next stages of the bailout arrangement, providing for the participation of the IMF in the rescue programme, by means of a 14-month precautionary stand-by arrangement. Agreement on the disbursement of further tranches of lending was reached during 2017-18. The Greek economic recovery commenced in earnest, with the budget recording a primary surplus (that is, excluding debt interest payments), and unemployment beginning slowly to decline. In November 2017 Tsipras announced that, following consultation with Greece’s creditors, some 3m. pensioners and other vulnerable groups particularly affected by austerity measures would receive what he termed a `social dividend’ of €1,400m., after the primary budget surplus target for the year was exceeded. Although GDP declined by 0.2% in 2015 and by 0.5% in 2016, it was positive thereafter, at 1.1% in 2017, 1.7% in 2018 and 1.9% in 2019, according to IMF figures.</p>
          <p>Shortly before Greece’s exit from the third bailout programme, a substantive debt-relief agreement was announced in late June 2018 (when a post-bailout monitoring arrangement was finalized), under which maturities on major parts of Greece’s debt obligations would be extended for 10 years. The country was to be eligible for periodic debt relief aid until mid-2022, while maintaining a primary budget surplus of 3.5% of GDP. The final tranche of financial assistance for Greece was disbursed in August 2018, when Greece successfully exited the bailout programme. There was no desire for a fourth bailout, and Greece was to attempt to finance its own needs thereafter. This bailout exit largely proceeded as planned, with no significant run on bank deposits or on financial markets implying exposure to Greece. In March 2019 the Government issued its first 10-year sovereign bond for nine years, raising some €2,500m.</p>

          <heading>Economic Recovery</heading>
          <p>After SYRIZA was defeated in legislative elections in July 2019, newly appointed Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis of Nea Dimokratia (New Democracy) presented economic reforms designed to promote private investment and accelerate growth, including tax reductions. In January 2020 the Fitch Ratings agency upgraded Greece’s long-term credit rating, after which the Government issued a further, 15-year bond. However, the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe in the early months of 2020 halted Greece’s incipient economic recovery. Mitsotakis announced economic support measures for the most severely affected citizens and businesses, with the subsidization of salaries and benefits, and tax relief. The total cost, of some €24,000m. in 2020, was partly financed by the EU. Largely as the result of a decline of some 80% in revenue from the crucial tourism industry during the COVID-19 crisis, GDP recorded a contraction of 9% in 2020, according to IMF data, with the Greek economy being among the most severely affected by the COVID-19 crisis in the EU. Additional support measures for the tourism industry were announced in early 2021, and it subsequently began to record a recovery. In 2021 overall growth in GDP of 8.4% was recorded, and GDP growth continued at a strong, albeit reduced rate of 5.9% in 2022, assisted by continued recovery in the tourism sector.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, following a European Council agreement in July 2020 EU member states had established the Next Generation EU fund, providing for a recovery and resilience programme worth a total of €672,500m. in loans and grants to aid economic recovery from the COVID-19 crisis throughout the EU. Greece’s National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) was to provide EU funding of some €17,800m. in grants and €12,700m. in loans during 2021-26, and received endorsement by the European Commission in June 2021. The plan allocated 37.5% of funds to environmental objectives, with planned reforms including improvements to electricity infrastructure and domestic energy efficiency, an increase in the number of charging points available for electric vehicles by more than 8,000, the introduction of electric buses in Athens and Thessaloniki, and the creation of more cycling and pedestrian pathways in Athens. (Notably, in terms of the environment, by 2022 renewable energy already provided the largest proportion of electricity production in Greece, at 42%.) Meanwhile, under the EU’s COVID-19 recovery programme, digital objectives were to account for 23.2% of funding in Greece, with objectives including the extension of 5G communications networks, plans for the digitization of archives in the public sector and for the introduction of advanced technologies, the digitization of businesses, and the increased use of digital technologies by small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular. Other projects included plans to provide vouchers to some 600,000 school children and students from low-income families in order to facilitate the purchase of equipment such as laptops. Additional plans included support to facilitate employment and social inclusion (including provisions for the long-term unemployed and disadvantaged people, including refugees and Roma), the expansion of child care to help women return to the workforce, and the introduction of a new national public health programme, including national screening programmes and improvements in the provision of palliative care. The public administration was to be improved, with reforms to the tax administration and the judiciary. In August 2021 the European Commission disbursed an initial tranche of pre-financing funds to Greece under the arrangement, equivalent to some 13% of Greece’s total allocation under the EU’s Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF). A first payment of €3,600m. under the RRF followed in April 2022, and a second payment, again amounting to €3,600m., was disbursed in January 2023.</p>
          <p>
      Meanwhile, agreement on the cessation of `enhanced surveillance’ by international institutions, in effect from 2010, had been reached in June 2022. It ended in August, with the European Commission acknowledging that Greece had largely satisfied its policy commitments. This was a significant development, particularly given the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of the Russian Federation’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February. The ongoing conflict had a deleterious impact on EU economies, with the imposition of several rounds of stringent EU sanctions on Russian exports of energy, and subsequent increases in the prices of food and surging energy prices (albeit mitigated by government subsidies) contributing to high rates of consumer price inflation throughout that year. The annual rate of consumer price inflation averaged 9.2% in Greece during 2022, according to the IMF. It peaked in September 2022 (although food price inflation was expected to remain persistent), and the IMF predicted that inflation would be recorded at a more manageable rate of 4.0% in 2023. Despite the challenging external environment, GDP growth was projected by the IMF to be maintained in 2023, at a rate of 2.6%. Meanwhile, however, the ratio of national debt to GDP continued to present a major challenge, and was the highest in the eurozone: the level of debt had reached 212.4% of GDP in 2020, according to IMF data, and by 2022 remained very high, at 177.4% of GDP. The average rate of unemployment, which had been under 10% from 2000 until midway through 2010, peaked at about 27% during the years of financial crisis. However, by 2018 the unemployment rate had declined to around 18%, and it was recorded at 13.3% in 2021 and 11.9% in 2022. Nevertheless, employment continued to have a disproportionate impact on young people and women, at rates of 24.9% and 15.6%, respectively. In a response to rising
      
       living costs, the Government announced an increase in the minimum wage by 9.4% from 1 April 2023.
    </p>
          <p>Mitsotakis was re-elected as Prime Minister following elections in mid-2023, despite various challenges to his leadership, including a surveillance scandal and a devastating rail crash in February that had raised concerns about the impact of years of under-investment on the country’s infrastructure. The Government planned to implement reforms in the rail sector, ensuring the full deployment of the EU’s safety system, the European Rail Traffic Management System, throughout the core railway network. Following his re-election, the General Index of the Athens Stock Exchange was reported to have reached its highest level for a decade, as Mitsotakis was widely considered to have effectively steered the Greek economic recovery, despite the recent and unanticipated challenges of the pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine. He pledged to maintain economic and political stability, while implementing a programme of wide-ranging reforms intended to combat inequality, improve public services and health care, and accelerate digitalization. The Government aimed to increase public investment, encourage foreign direct investment, increase export trade, combat tax evasion and oversee an increase in the average wage by some 25% by 2027, while maintaining consistent growth in GDP. However, other challenges included Greece’s susceptibility to damaging natural disasters, including floods and wildfires, which re-emerged as a prominent issue, with a deleterious impact on both the environment and the economy, in July 2023 after wildfires broke out on the island of Rhodes.</p>
