          <p id="GR.GEOG.1">Greece, officially known as the Hellenic Republic, lies in South-Eastern Europe, on the northern shores of the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Its territory comprises the southern Balkan peninsula (itself including a peninsula, the Peloponnese, connected to the rest of continental Greece by the Isthmus of Corinth), a narrow strip of land on the northern coast of the Aegean Sea and more than 1,400 islands, the largest of which is Crete (Kríti). It is bordered by Albania to the north-west, North Macedonia and Bulgaria to the north, and Türkiye (formerly known as Turkey) to the north-east and east. The principal island groups are the Ionians in the west and the Cyclades and Dodecanese in the Aegean Sea to the east. Greece’s total area is 131,957 sq&#160;km (50,949 sq&#160;miles).</p>
          <p id="GR.GEOG.2">Most of continental Greece and many of the islands are mountainous, with much of the land above 1,500&#160;m (4,921&#160;ft). The Pindos Mountains run from north to south along the peninsula, and continue into the Peloponnese and Crete. The Rhodope mountains lie in the northern regions of Macedonia and Thrace and form a natural barrier between Greece and its northern neighbours. The highest point is Mount Olympus, near the eastern coast of the peninsula, at 2,911&#160;m (9,551 ft). The only significant lowlands are in the river valleys and between the mountains and the coast. The principal rivers are the Achelous (draining into the Ionian Sea in the west) and the Pineios and Aliakmon (Haliacmon), which flow into the Aegean Sea.</p>

          <heading>Climate</heading>
          <p id="GR.GEOG.3">Southern Greece and the islands have a Mediterranean climate, with hot, dry summers and mild, damp winters. Northern regions experience continental influences and are cooler, especially in mountain areas, where snow is common in winter. The hottest month in Athens (Athína), the capital, is July, with a daily average temperature of 28°C (82°F); the coldest month is January, with a daily average of 9°C (48°F). The west of the country is the wettest area. Average annual rainfall in Athens, in the east of continental Greece, is 414&#160;mm (16.3&#160;ins).</p>

          <heading>Population</heading>
          <p id="GR.GEOG.4">
      According to the official results of the census conducted in October 2021, the resident population of Greece was 10,482,487, giving a population density of 79.4
      
       per sq km. Almost all the population are ethnic Greeks; there are small Turkish and Albanian minorities and some Slavophones. Greece has experienced a high degree of internal migration, from the rural areas to the towns and from the mountain areas to the coasts and plains: by 1999 some 60% of the population were resident in urban areas. Almost all the population speaks Standard Modern Greek.

          <p id="GR.GEOG.6">The established church is the Eastern Orthodox Church, of which nearly 97% of the population are adherents. There are small communities of Roman Catholics and Muslims.</p>
          <p id="GR.GEOG.7">The capital is Athens, which had a population of 643,452 at the 2021 census. Other major cities include Thessaloniki (319,045 inhabitants), Patras (Patra, 215,922), Iraklion (Heraklion), the principal town of Crete (179,302), Piraeus (168,151), Larissa (164,095), Volos (139,670) and Peristeri (with 133,630 inhabitants).</p>
