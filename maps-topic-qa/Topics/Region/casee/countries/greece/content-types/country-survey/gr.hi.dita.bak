          <heading>20th Century Greece</heading>
          <p>The 19th century closed with the disastrous Greco-Turkish war of 1897, and the 20th began with continued political confrontation, culminating in a military coup in 1909. The 1910s were swallowed by war—the First Balkan War against the Ottoman Empire, then the Second Balkan War against Bulgaria, then the First World War, and finally (and most catastrophically) a renewed Ottoman conflict that culminated in the overwhelming Greek defeat, with the mass casualties, displacement and internal strife, of 1922.</p>
          <p>The 1930s brought continued discord and, eventually, dictatorship. During the Second World War Greece was occupied and partitioned, and its end heralded a socially and economically crippling civil war with both US and Soviet involvement, one of the earliest examples of the proxy conflicts that characterized the Cold War. The legacy of this civil war dominated Greek politics throughout the third quarter of the century, even as the economy grew rapidly with assistance under the Marshall Plan (a programme of financial aid provided by the USA following the Second World War), expanded European co-operation and the increased importance of the emerging petroleum-based economies in the nearby Middle East.</p>
          <p>Eventually, fearing a leftward shift by the centrist Government, in 1967 a group of right-wing army officers staged a coup and took power. With assistance from the USA, which sought to protect Greece’s status as a bulwark against communism in Europe, this military junta survived a counter-coup. The army’s violent suppression of a student uprising at the National Polytechnic in November 1973 resulted in the ousting of the head of the junta. However, the `Regime of the Colonels’ lasted until 1974 when, amid strident student protest and after a disastrous invasion of Cyprus, and the global oil price boom that threatened every sector of the economy, the army leadership withdrew support for the regime in July, and democracy was re-established in the form of the republic that survives today.</p>
          <p>
      Konstantinos Karamanlis, of the centre-right Nea Dimokratia (ND—New Democracy), won the first democratic elections in November 1974 and governed throughout the transition period (
      <i>metapolitefsi</i>
      ). However, with the continued impact of the oil crisis, the economy remained stagnant and high inflation began. The leaders of the former junta and those responsible for the killing of student protesters were tried, convicted and imprisoned in 1975, in a major test of both national stability and the democratic process of justice. The 
      <i>metapolitefsi</i>
       had been a success. Karamanlis secured re-election with a reduced majority in 1977 and set Greece firmly on the path of European unity: it had been engaged in the accession process to the European Communities (EC, which became the European Union—EU—in 1983) since 1962, although this had been suspended while the junta was in power.
    </p>
          <p>So, for all the references to classical antiquity and to Greece being the birthplace of democracy that are an inescapable part of any international media coverage of the country, it was a young polity that in 1981 joined the EC. Later in the year the first post-junta transition of power from one party to another occurred, bringing to power Greece’s first left-wing government. Andreas Papandreou, the son of former liberal Prime Minister Georgios, led the Panellinio Socialistiko Kinima (PASOK—Panhellenic Socialist Movement) to pre-eminence, if not dominance, in Greek politics for a generation. Accession to the EC was perceived as a guarantor of stability, both by mainstream Greek opinion, and by its existing members, anxious that Greece should not slide back into the authoritarian government from which it had emerged in the mid-1970s.</p>
          <p>Membership of the EC allowed Greece to develop further the economic strengths that it had built in the middle part of the century, despite earlier bankruptcies and the continuing political instability. Greece developed mass market tourism to go along with its long-established popularity with financial and cultural elites (as well as low-budget independent travellers), and this led to a sustained improvement in foreign exchange, as well as renewed income growth. Services continued to expand, with a financial sector developing to complement the long-standing strengths in logistics and, above all, shipping.</p>
          <p>For all these advances, productivity and wages remained sluggish, and growth lagged behind that of the major European economies. Moreover, the PASOK administration reacted to the exclusion of generations of those with left-wing sympathies from government and the higher ranks of public service by expanding the civil service and boosting salaries and pensions, as well as granting favourable treatment to key supporters, and their families and associates. This was largely financed by means of borrowing, and the sovereign debt stock increased sharply. Moreover, it engrained in the population the sense that the Government was inherently corrupt—for years the right had favoured its allies, now the left was doing the same. Tax avoidance and general non-compliance with officialdom increased sharply, particularly after a scandal in which a prominent PASOK-affiliated banker fled the country when accused of embezzling his bank’s funds.</p>
          <p>The Treaty on European Union (TEU—popularly known as the Maastricht Treaty) in 1992 represented almost as large a boost to Greece as had its accession to the EC a decade earlier. The treaty formalized plans for a common currency for EU members, and established convergence criteria that all national governments should follow. Politicians, voters and markets all viewed the Treaty as confirming and deepening Greece’s connections to the European mainstream, and potentially lessening the peculiarities in the country’s political economy: the nationalism that was manifest throughout the political spectrum, and excessive deficits and debt, managed chiefly through devaluation of the drachma and consequent inflation. The `Maastricht criteria’ committed Greece to a deficit of no more than 3% of gross domestic product (GDP) and an overall debt-to-GDP ratio of no more than 60%. Greece was some way from meeting these criteria, but it was far from alone in that, and its direction was definitely positive.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, a clear duopoly had developed in Greek politics, with ND and (slightly more frequently) PASOK taking turns in government during the 1980s and 1990s. The third force in politics was on the far left, in which initially the staid, pro-Soviet Kommunistiko Komma Ellados (KKE—Communist Party of Greece) was prominent. After the Eastern bloc fell in 1989-91, the radical alliance, Synaspismos tis Aristeras kai tis Proódou (Synaspismos—Coalition of the Left and Progess—later renamed Synaspismos tis Aristeras ton Kinimaton kai tis Oikologias—Coalition of the Left of Movements and Ecology), which at first included the KKE, became the leading far-left force. By the late 1990s both the KKE and Synaspismos were represented in parliament, while one of the two mainstream parties generally enjoyed a small overall majority. The occasional independent candidate to the right of ND won a parliamentary seat when allowed by the electoral law (which was regularly changed by new governments soon after taking office), but there was no substantial party in that space until the emergence of the nationalist Laikos Orthodoxos Synagermos (LAOS—Popular Orthodox Rally) in the 2004 elections. </p>
          <p>If the 19th century ended with conflict between Greece and its neighbours in the eastern Mediterranean, the 20th ended with sudden and rapid improvement in relations with the largest of these, and with Greece’s traditional geopolitical rival, Turkey (now known as Türkiye). An earthquake that caused extensive damage in the north-west of Turkey in August 1999 was followed by an unexpected outpouring of support and assistance from both the Greek state and its people. Minister of Foreign Affairs Georgios (George) Papandreou (the US-born son of Andreas Papandreou, and generally known by the anglicized form of his name to distinguish him from his grandfather) took personal charge of the official relief effort, while municipal authorities, non-governmental organizations and citizens’ groups from across the country made their own independent efforts. The gratitude in Turkey was such that, when a smaller earthquake struck the Greek capital, Athens, three weeks later, the Turkish Government and its citizens reciprocated the effort. Papandreou and his counterparts in Turkey built on this atmosphere of goodwill, and while relations were not fully normalized (not least because of continuing differences over Cyprus), the improvement in mutual relations resulting from this `earthquake diplomacy’ was real, and was a major factor in Greece supporting Turkey’s EU membership aspirations from 2005.</p>
          <p>Turkey is not the only neighbour with which Greece’s relations have historically been complicated. Greece has remained at a technical state of war with its north-western neighbour, Albania, since the Second World War, despite a rapid improvement in relations between the two countries following the end of communist rule in Albania in the early 1990s, exemplified by the signing of a friendship and security agreement in 1996. The flow of Albanian economic migrants to Greece thereafter resulted in some resentment towards Albania among Greeks, although this has become a less significant concern since the mid-2000s, since other migrant flows have caused even more disquiet.</p>
          <p>More serious and enduring was the dispute with Greece’s northern neighbour that commenced upon the break-up of Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Greece objected to the use of the name Macedonia by the newly independent republic, on the grounds that this implied a territorial claim over the traditional Greek region of the same name. Consequently, the new country reluctantly adopted the nomenclature `former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia’ (FYRM) for official international use (while `the Republic of Macedonia’, its constitutional name, continued to be used domestically, and, increasingly, in some bilateral relations), while refusing to abandon the idea of dropping the additional words at a later date; negotiations on the matter continued with mediation by the United Nations (UN). Although Greece accepted the establishment of relations with its new neighbour, it made it clear that it could not support the FYRM’s process towards North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and EU membership while the question of the country’s permanent name remained unresolved, and as a result, the FYRM was left behind other countries of the Western Balkans in the move towards harmonization with the European institutions.</p>

      Into the 21
      <sc>st</sc>
       Century
    </heading>
          <p>PASOK won the legislative elections held in April 2000, under Konstantinos Simitis, a founder member of the party, who had governed unspectacularly since first coming to office as premier in 1996. Simitis was relatively centrist, compared with previous PASOK leaders, and had been an economics professor before entering active politics. A former ally of Andreas Papandreou, who moved him between various ministries as small-scale crises demanded, Simitis often played up to his image as a technocrat, in particular by displaying enthusiasm for policies deemed unexciting on an electoral level, but vital for Greece’s long-term development.</p>
          <p>Shortly after Simitis’s re-election, the EU announced that Greece had qualified for admission to the eurozone in January 2001. The news of Greece’s prospective eurozone membership was met with some disquiet throughout Europe, as the structural weakness of its economy remained obvious, but since the Maastricht tests had been passed, there was little that other member states could do to keep Greece out of the area.</p>
          <p>A confrontation with the Orthodox Church over the question of the national identity card was an example of Simitis’s commitment to liberal principles. The national statistical agency had recommended that in a forthcoming revision of the identity card the information displayed upon it would be changed—in particular, it would no longer specify the holder’s ethnicity or religion. Simitis refused to accept the change concerning ethnicity, but supported the recommendation that religious affiliation no longer be stated, much to the annoyance of the powerful Orthodox Church, which organized demonstrations against the supposed forced secularization of Greek life. Simitis maintained this stance, despite waning popularity, and was rescued by the Constitutional Court’s ruling that specifying religion on the identity card (and thus creating the possibility for official discrimination on religious grounds) was unconstitutional. Simitis’s personal political authority was severely damaged by this incident and by numerous corruption allegations, however, and he announced in early 2004 that he would not remain in the PASOK leadership. George Papandreou was elected to succeed Simitis, but he was heavily defeated in the legislative elections held in March, with ND leader Konstantinos (Kostas) Karamanlis (the nephew of the first post-junta Prime Minister) taking office.</p>
          <p>An undisputed success of the latter period of Simitis’s leadership was the effective dismantling of the Epanastatiki Organosi Dekaefta Noemvri (17N—November 17 Revolutionary Organization), a left-wing militant group which had operated in Greece since the revolution that deposed the junta in the mid-1970s. The group’s name marked the date of the violent suppression of the 1973 uprising at Athens Polytechnic, which had proved a key moment in the decline of the junta’s power. Its first attack took place in 1975, when its operatives shot and killed the US Central Intelligence Agency’s head of station outside his home in Athens. Its attacks continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s, generally targeting representatives of the US or the West in Greece, as well as wealthy Greek business figures and politicians linked to them, and on occasion Turkish officials. In between these incidents, the group conducted robberies and kidnappings as a means of financing its activity.</p>
          <p>The final fatal attack attributed to 17N was the murder of a British military attaché on an Athens street in 2000. In June 2002 a 17N member was injured while attempting to plant a bomb at a shipping company office. Police were able to detain him, and under interrogation he revealed information that led to the arrests of several others, including the group’s leader, and the discovery of safe houses, weapons caches and stores of propaganda. Following a trial of 19 suspects in the following year, 15 were convicted of involvement in the group’s campaign, six were sentenced to life imprisonment, and the group never claimed another attack.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, 17N was not the only manifestation of the willingness of some on the fringes of Greek politics to use violence, and while none of the groups that has emerged since that time has proven as enduring, as determined or as dangerous as 17N, the use of violent methods for political ends has persisted as a feature of Greek society in subsequent decades. Groups such as Epanastatikos Agonas (Revolutionary Struggle), espousing a far-left or anarchist ideology, have committed numerous smaller attacks, while small-scale attacks on banks or Western-owned businesses have remained more frequent than elsewhere in Europe. These are generally claimed by groups with a name suggesting left-wing sympathies, which is only used once. Among leading international businesses to have been targeted by left-wing militants are Citigroup, Microsoft and Novartis.</p>

          <heading>The 2004-09 ND Governments</heading>
          <p>One of Karamanlis’s first acts on assuming office in March 2004 was to order a review of the Simitis-era national accounts: while Greeks were generally happy to have joined the eurozone, there was widespread scepticism about the validity of Greece’s compliance with the Maastricht criteria, and Eurostat had twice refused to accept Greek data since the membership decision. The audit revealed some irregularities in accounting, which resulted in the discrediting of Simitis and PASOK in the eyes of much of the electorate—a view contributed to already by the prevalence of corruption allegations during Simitis’s term.</p>
          <p>The hosting of the Olympic Games in Athens in August 2004 was intended to be the country’s landmark event of the 2000s. The Games were generally considered a success, despite the enormous cost of hosting the event. While Karamanlis’s popularity rose in the aftermath of the Olympics and after a series of new anti-corruption efforts, measures to reform public finances were less successful, with debt and deficit increasing sharply. Karamanlis’s attempts to reform the education system met with renewed student militancy and damaged his popularity, as did a series of corruption scandals around his own administration, the most serious involving a state pension scheme. He scheduled early elections for September 2007, only for forest fires to break out during the campaign, resulting in some 65 deaths, with accusations of ineffective management adding to the weight of criticism against the Government.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, ND and Karamanlis were returned to office, albeit with a majority of just two seats in the 300-seat Parliament (Vouli), and with LAOS securing representation for the first time. A two-seat majority was never likely to sustain the Government for a full parliamentary mandate, and Karamanlis’s second term was significantly less stable than even the second half of his first. Its focal event set the tone for much of what followed in the 2010s. As the first effects of the global financial crisis began to be felt in the USA and elsewhere in Europe, increased unemployment and continued austerity in Greece triggered a period of social protest. Then, in December 2008, a police officer became involved in an argument with a group of youths during a routine patrol in the Exarcheia district of central Athens, long popular with students, anarchists and left-wing activists. The officer discharged his weapon, and a 15-year-old boy, Alexandros Grigoropoulos, was fatally wounded. Protests and clashes with police erupted as soon as reports of the incident spread, and disturbances ensued in most major cities that evening.</p>
          <p>Central Athens was dominated by the protests in the following days, with shops and parked vehicles targeted during rioting. Protesters were prevented by police from reaching Syntagma Square, the symbolic centre of the city, adjacent to the parliament building. Student groups staged occupations at all major institutions of higher education and many high schools. Four days after the incident, the two main trade union confederations had already scheduled a general strike with a march on Syntagma Square—this went ahead but was completely dominated by protests relating to the shooting, and the scenes of rioting were the worst seen in Greece since the deposition of the junta. As Greece became the focus of international attention, financial markets followed the reports, forcing up the interest rate demanded for Greek debt, already higher than most of Europe owing to economic instability, and a major gap between the Greek premium and those of other so-called peripheral European nations now emerged. With investors increasingly risk-averse as the financial crisis continued, this had a major impact on the Government’s ability to raise finance—even as Karamanlis’s administration produced an optimistic budget for 2009.</p>
          <p>The worst of the disturbances lasted for about 10 days, but smaller protests continued well into January 2009. Political parties condemned the rioters, with the exception of Synaspismos, which had effectively been reconstituted as the Synaspismos Rizospastikís Aristeras (SYRIZA—Coalition of the Radical Left). Its leader, Alexis Tsipras, took a more sympathetic tone, remaining largely neutral and criticizing the state’s response, making clear the belief on the left of Greek politics that police brutality was commonplace, and that the right-wing sympathies of many officers resulted in unfair treatment for anarchists and other protesters. Greece was now politically and economically unstable, to an extent that concerned EU partners and the European Central Bank (ECB). Karamanlis survived, but was weakened beyond repair, and Georgios Papandreou called for early legislative elections. In the knowledge that PASOK could trigger the polls early in 2010 by refusing to co-operate in the election of a new President by Parliament, Karamanlis called early polls for October 2009, acknowledging the growing economic crisis (Greece was by now in recession) and seeking a fresh mandate.</p>

          <heading>Political and Economic Crisis</heading>
          <p>Papandreou secured a comfortable victory in the 2009 elections, becoming a representative of the third generation of his family to become Prime Minister (Karamanlis was the nephew of a previous premier, a further demonstration of the highly dynastic aspect of Greek politics). Papandreou’s slogan for the election was `There is Money’—for social programmes, continued high state employment and continued pension entitlement. However, Papandreou—along with Karamanlis and almost everyone else—knew that there was not. Greece was struggling to borrow on financial markets and obliged to pay a substantial premium in interest rates when it could. Shortly after taking office, Papandreou stated that the economy was `in intensive care’ and introduced an emergency budget, with dramatic cuts in public spending. This did not prevent the credit ratings agencies from reducing Greece’s ratings, increasing borrowing costs still further. Trade unions responded to the budget with more strikes, and fears of a stalemate increased, as measures to prevent a default on debt proved politically unacceptable.</p>
          <p>In February 2010, instead of being deterred from his reforms by the protests, Papandreou announced that his only option was to redouble efforts, introducing further austerity measures, freezing public sector pay and increasing taxes on higher incomes. During another strike in response to the measures, tear gas was fired on demonstrators in Syntagma Square. The Government announced a further austerity package in March, followed by the first positive development for some time as a debt auction was fully subscribed, albeit at elevated interest rates. A second auction later in March was less successful. Secret negotiations began with the EU, with the aim of crafting an emergency assistance package—a prospect that German Chancellor Angela Merkel (effectively the dominant figure in the EU countries) had previously excluded. With major debt repayments scheduled for April, Papandreou had little choice but formally to request the bailout, once a framework agreement had been reached—in May the EU, the ECB and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) together offered Greece a three-year, €110,000m. bailout package, contingent on Greece cutting spending still further and improving its revenue collection.</p>
          <p>Reaction in Greece was furious, with immediate general strikes and demonstrations demanding Papandreou’s resignation. All opposition parties rejected the agreement, as did several PASOK deputies, and the Government felt obliged to expel anyone who voted against enabling legislation from the party’s parliamentary group. The largest demonstration yet led to fatalities when a breakaway group of anarchists set fire to several vehicles and buildings in the financial district of Athens—one bank branch had locked down as a protective measure, and its employees struggled to escape when the fire took hold, resulting in three deaths. This proved something of a warning to protesters disposed to use violence, and actions that threatened casualties were less common thereafter. The first of a series of pension reforms followed in July, and another austerity budget ensued in December.</p>
          <p>Syntagma Square was again the focal point of protests in 2011, as an encampment was established by demonstrators. Regular protests in the area resulted in clashes with police, often involving the use of tear gas and precipitating allegations of police brutality. The encampment eventually dispersed itself in mid-year, after the failure of an attempt to convince PASOK deputies not to support the oversight of government policy of the `troika’ comprising the EU, the ECB and the IMF. Many of the measures demanded by the troika would in normal circumstances have been considered politically disastrous—job losses, wage freezes and pension reductions—but circumstances were by now anything but normal. A new property tax introduced in 2011 was levied via electricity bills, in an attempt to prevent evasion. Opposition to the troika’s requirements was universal—but the PASOK Government was obliged to take a pragmatic stance, a decision that did nothing to protect its popularity, either at home or abroad, where significant movements opposing further support for Greece had emerged in leading eurozone countries, most notably Germany.</p>
          <p>The nationalist streak in Greek politics was visible throughout this period, with highly emotive language being used by opponents of the austerity measures, but the Government was able to adopt most of the `prior actions’ demanded by the creditor institutions. However, a more strident nationalism was gaining support in the form of Chrysi Avgi (Golden Dawn), an extreme nationalist group that incorporated elements of Neo-Nazism in its ideology. Chrysi Avgi had been an occasional feature on the far right for decades but grew in prominence in response to the crisis as a political force, establishing a presence in low-income areas of major cities, and operating welfare initiatives such as food banks for Greek nationals only. Immigration from Africa, Asia and the Middle East had increased in the 2000s, with Greece an important landing point for people traffickers and, at least before the crisis, able to provide plentiful work in the informal economy, such as at the vast industrial and transhipment complex in the Athens suburb of Aspropyrgos. Chrysi Avgi was particularly opposed to immigration from predominantly Muslim countries, and campaigned against the establishment of any Islamic prayer facilities, and its supporters attacked a number of facilities inhabited by immigrants from countries such as Iraq and Pakistan.</p>
          <p>Papandreou succeeded in securing approval of a fifth austerity package in October 2011, amid renewed protests, but attempted to organize a referendum to gain public support for his policy, and to form a national unity government that would guide Greece through the crisis, in accordance with EU wishes. When both these efforts failed, he resigned in November, and was succeeded by Lucas Papademos, a technocrat, at the head of an interim coalition administration comprising members of PASOK, ND and LAOS. Other indicators of economic crisis, such as acquisitive crime, suicide and emigration, also increased sharply.</p>
          <p>By early 2012 it became clear that a second bailout would be needed to avoid Greece falling into bankruptcy, and consequently being obliged to leave the eurozone and possibly even the EU. After a sixth austerity package was approved in February, amid the most violent protests in more than a year, a second bailout was swiftly agreed—committing the troika to a further substantial package of support for Greece (totalling some €130,000m.) until 2016. Legislative elections eventually took place in May 2012, and while ND won the highest number of seats, there was no clear winner, with representation in Parliament fragmented. PASOK, under the new leadership of former Minister of Finance Evangelos Venizelos, suffered a dramatic loss of support, winning only 41 seats, compared with the 160 it had won at the previous elections. Most of its vote-share was taken by SYRIZA, which had dominated opposition to the bailouts on the left, and now became the second largest parliamentary party. After attempts by the main parties to form a government were unsuccessful, senior judge Panagiotis Pikrammenos was tasked with leading an interim technocratic Government until further elections in June.</p>
          <p>ND again failed to gain a majority in these second elections, but was close enough to be able to negotiate a unity Government with PASOK and a small centre-left party. SYRIZA was again placed second, while Chrysi Avgi, which had won representation for the first time in May 2012, retained 18 of its 21 seats. Antonis Samaras, the leader of ND and a strident opponent of co-operation with the troika during Papandreou’s tenure, became the new Prime Minister and committed Greece to a path of `reluctant compliance’ with the troika’s demands. New austerity measures were approved in late 2012.</p>
          <p>Protest activity eased after the new Government took office, with a sense that years of public anger had achieved little, and would have little impact upon a conservative-dominated administration. Samaras introduced two reform bills in 2013. As part of the second, he attempted to close the state broadcaster, and reopen it under a new name with a significantly smaller scope, resulting in a public outcry and causing one of the smaller coalition parties to withdraw from the Government. Nevertheless, this seemed like a period of relative stability, with the debt crisis elsewhere in Europe easing and fears of contagion from the periphery of the EU into its core now appearing unlikely to be realized. Economic growth was recorded in the final quarter of 2013, for the first time in four years. In reality, however, this was merely a brief interlude amid ongoing economic and political turmoil.</p>

     <gen-section print-style="COLUMN" sllink="SLSDOC" slsdocrf="GEN-SECTREF">
          <heading>SYRIZA in Power</heading>
          <p>By early 2014 Samaras was clinging to office. His parliamentary majority had been reduced to two, after a deputy who had refused to vote in favour of troika-inspired measures was expelled. SYRIZA, by now leading in opinion polls, with Tsipras enthusing younger, older and poorer voters (and placed first in elections to the European Parliament in May), stated clearly that it was reluctant to support the Government’s nominee for President—the incumbent’s term was scheduled to end early in 2015 and, if no compromise could be reached, a new Parliament would have to be elected. Samaras spent much of 2014 trying to secure the two-thirds’ majority required for the election of a new President. However, after this proved impossible, in December he resigned.</p>
          <p>The prospect of SYRIZA—an inexperienced coalition of the far left, Greens, anarchists and other minority interests—reaching government terrified many in the EU. Tsipras had pledged to repudiate Greece’s agreements with the troika and `re-establish Greek national dignity’—which Germany and other creditor nations interpreted as ingratitude. While SYRIZA’s economic plans made little sense, those of the previous administrations had proved disastrous, and the electorate’s choice of idealism particularly reflected a desire to move on from the post-junta duopoly, with its legacy of patronage and corruption.</p>
          <p>SYRIZA secured a comfortable victory in legislative elections in January 2015, only one seat short of an overall majority. Support for PASOK fell still further, and Chrysi Avgi became the third largest force in an even more fragmented Parliament. Tsipras formed a coalition with the small right-wing Anexartitoi Ellines (ANEL—Independent Greeks) party. He appointed the left-wing economist Yanis Varoufakis—abrasive, charismatic, media-friendly and fluent in English—as Minister of Finance, in a direct challenge to the orthodoxy of German fiscal conservatism, and in an attempt to regain international sympathy for Greece. What followed were the most chaotic eight months of the whole crisis. The EU rejected almost all of Varoufakis’s proposals for alterations to policy, and relations with the Tsipras Government were strained as a result. Nevertheless, it was clear that Tsipras was tending to pragmatism, and that this was creating tensions with Varoufakis.</p>
          <p>Negotiations on the completion of the second bailout descended into brinkmanship, with one emergency extension to the loan granted in February 2015 in order to avert the much-feared Greek debt default. Eventually, the troika proposed a package to Tsipras under which the last payment of the second bailout would be released, and negotiations on a third commence. Tsipras announced that he would submit the measures to a referendum, as Papandreou had proposed four years earlier. This time the plan went ahead, however, and the referendum was conducted in July, with Tsipras and the Government advocating that the proposed austerity measures be rejected. However, this was not a smooth process, with depositors fearing a collapse in the Greek banking system, and making large-scale withdrawals throughout June. Eventually, Tsipras announced the closure of banks (which was extended to 20 days), and the introduction of significant capital controls. These limits were gradually eased from July onwards.</p>
          <p>Tsipras’s wish was granted, as more than 60% of those participating in the referendum rejected the proposals. While most of Europe interpreted this as a vote against the EU, after which Greece would finally leave the eurozone, Tsipras returned to negotiations with the troika, not to pass on the `no’ vote, but to claim that it had strengthened his mandate, and that more favourable terms should result. This infuriated Varoufakis, who resigned, and also further exasperated the EU. Finally, a package similar to the one rejected in the referendum was accepted by Tsipras and approved by Parliament—the second bailout was completed, and the third, which was valued at €86,000m. and would again last for three years, was approved in August. Conscious that he had rejected the results of the referendum (but also that the electorate was sympathetic to his decision), Tsipras resigned and scheduled further elections for September. These elections produced similar results, and the SYRIZA-ANEL coalition resumed office. An uneasy accommodation settled in: the EU accepted that it would be dealing with Tsipras for the foreseeable future, while he accepted that reluctant compliance was Greece’s best chance of weathering the crisis, and the economy continued to recover slowly.</p>
          <p>Despite the apparent easing in the economic and political crisis, a new emergency situation suddenly emerged for Greece from mid-2015. Long a favoured destination country for people traffickers, Greece became the principal point of landing in Europe for refugees fleeing from the conflicts in the Syrian Arab Republic and Iraq through Turkey. Eastern Aegean islands, such as Lesvos, Kos and Chios, experienced vast numbers of arrivals by sea, on a scale with which the severely rationalized public sector and civil society were unable to cope. Tsipras was sympathetic to refugees (despite ANEL’s harder stance), and the Government attempted to register and house them until they could be relocated to other European countries or returned to Turkey. Nevertheless, conditions on Kos and Lesvos, and for a time at the Idomeni border crossing to the FYRM, verged on those of a humanitarian crisis. The pressure on Greece eased in 2016, after the EU agreed a return programme with Turkey, and arranged the resettlement of more refugees in some countries, while the focus of migration shifted to the central Mediterranean route to Italy.</p>
          <p>SYRIZA’s second term was much less eventful than its first. It remained somewhat capricious in policy, but was able to maintain—just—its strategy of reluctant compliance with its creditors. The subject of debt relief, repeatedly broached by Tsipras and hitherto categorically rejected by the EU (but considered essential by the IMF, which refused to enter the third bailout without it), entered discussions in 2017. In June 2018 agreement was reached on extending Greece’s repayment terms by 10 years, and Greece exited the third bailout programme in August. Nevertheless, by this stage it had become evident to voters that SYRIZA was not so different from the other parties as it had claimed to be, and its popularity suffered as a result. By mid-2017 SYRIZA retained a small majority in Parliament, but its coalition with ANEL was near collapse, and in opinion polls it had been substantially overtaken by ND, now led by Kyriakos Mitsotakis (another member of one of Greece’s great political dynasties, his father having served as Prime Minister in the early 1990s).</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, in the area of foreign affairs, in June 2018 UN-mediated negotiations on the question of the constitutional name of the FYRM produced an accord between the two Governments. The accord, which was signed at Lake Prespa, on the joint border, and consequently became known as the Prespa agreement, provided for the FYRM to be renamed as the `Republic of North Macedonia’. Although this proposal had to be submitted to a national referendum in the FYRM and for parliamentary approval in Greece, with endorsement by either initially far from certain, it at least represented substantial progress.</p>
          <p>The referendum in the FYRM unsurprisingly proved a matter of significant political contention, with parties opposing the motion (framed as being `in favour of EU and NATO membership by accepting the agreement’ with Greece) urging voters to boycott the poll in September 2018. Both sides claimed victory after only 36.9% of the electorate consequently participated, although 94.2% of votes cast supported the motion. As a result (and in view of the non-binding nature of the referendum), the necessary constitutional amendments required approval by a two-thirds’ majority in the FYRM’s legislature—a majority that was just reached, with 80 of the 120 deputies voting in favour of the renaming proposal in October.</p>
          <p>The progress of the Prespa agreement in Greece was no less contentious. A Chrysi Avgi deputy called for the arrest and summary execution of all politicians and public officials involved in its drafting and signing; he attempted to flee the country but was subsequently arrested on suspicion of fomenting treason. Tsipras won a motion of confidence on 16 January 2019, securing the support of 151 votes in Parliament. Eventually, on 25 January the matter came to a final vote in Parliament, and the Prespa agreement was ratified, with 153 of the 300 deputies voting in favour; the accord entered into force on 12 February, when the FYRM was officially renamed as the Republic of North Macedonia. Opinion polls in Greece suggested that the accord would have been clearly rejected had the Government been forced to put the matter to referendum, but with no such requirement, Tsipras was able to claim its adoption as a victory for the renewed spirit of neighbourly friendship in Greece.</p>
          <p>Government affairs were not so favourable on the domestic front, however. ANEL had announced its withdrawal from the government coalition in protest at the vote to ratify the Prespa agreement, which was only approved with the support of the few ANEL deputies who were prepared to defy the leadership (and were expelled from the party as a result). ND renewed its call for early elections, but was unable to bring a no confidence motion until June, by which time Parliament’s term would in any case be nearing expiry. With the economy continuing to improve steadily since the conclusion of the bailout, Tsipras sought to repair SYRIZA’s standing by reversing some austerity reforms and job reductions effected during the height of the crisis. The party began to regain some support in opinion polls, but ND retained its lead as the election year began. This was confirmed in the elections to the European Parliament held in May 2019, when ND won 33.1% of the votes cast and eight of Greece’s 21 seats, representing a gain of three, while SYRIZA (23.8%) retained its six seats. Tsipras responded to the results by immediately scheduling early legislative elections for 7 July, in the hope that improved circumstances and the prospect of a new period of ND government would motivate his supporter base. However, his decision proved a miscalculation, as ND, headed by Mitsotakis, was decisively elected to government on 7 July, securing 39.9% of the votes cast, according to official figures, and a majority in Parliament (with 158 seats—having obtained an additional 50 seats under the `majority bonus’ system); SYRIZA received 31.5% of the votes and 86 seats. Tsipras immediately conceded defeat, while Mitsotakis pledged to institute extensive change under his mandate, focusing on attracting foreign investment to the country and creating employment.</p>

          <heading>Greece since 2020</heading>
          <p>The first year of the Mitsotakis Government was one of relative calm in comparison with Greece’s preceding decade. Originating in the centrist tradition within ND, Mitsotakis rejected appeals from the conservative wing of his party to direct tax cuts towards high-wage earners in the hope of a `trickle-down’ effect, with stimulus directly focused on generating employment. This approach proved popular, and Mitsotakis enjoyed substantial favour in the media and in opinion polls. Renewed crisis arose elsewhere, however. Turkey’s increasingly authoritarian stance under President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan impinged on Greece in a number of areas, including minority rights, energy exploration, and air and sea incursions by military craft. In March 2020 Erdoğan and the EU accused each other of abandoning their 2016 agreement on refugees, following an announcement by the Turkish Government that it would allow those hitherto contained in camps free passage through the country to Europe—inevitably prompting the immediate arrival of many thousands at its western borders and coastlines. Migrant traffic on the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean sea routes, and the land route via north-eastern Greece, briefly regained dramatically high levels, if nowhere near reaching the numbers recorded at the 2015 peak, before Greece responded with an increased military presence, supported by an intervention force supplied by the EU’s border protection agency FRONTEX.</p>
          <p>By this point, the COVID-19 pandemic had reached Europe, and the EU and Turkey reached an uneasy truce, recognizing that it was in the interests of neither for large numbers of migrants to move freely at a time when national populations were about to come under lockdown. The steep trajectory of infections and deaths registered in other European countries failed to transpire in Greece, and by early May 2020 the Greek Government was able to end its lockdown. The delayed tourist season began on 15 June, with strict anti-contagion measures in place, and flights restricted from countries still experiencing high numbers of fatalities.</p>
          <p>The impression that Greece had weathered the pandemic well, supported by World Health Organization statistics, was strong. General satisfaction with performance during the first months of Mitsotakis’s Government turned into strong approval, with some opinion polls in May and June 2020 giving ND support of more than 50%, and many in the party believed that the Prime Minister should take the opportunity to call early elections in the hope of winning a stronger mandate in Parliament. However, Mitsotakis repeated that he would give the recovery full priority and remain in office until the scheduled end of his term in 2023.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, criticism of government actions began to emerge. In particular, some of the Government’s executive decisions during the lockdown period started to appear questionable, with public contracts seeming to have been awarded during the suspension of the normal tendering process to companies with strong ND links. Moreover, criticism of government policy towards refugees, particularly on the Aegean islands and on the border with Turkey, intensified following Erdoğan’s decision to open the border in March 2020, in contravention of his agreement with the EU. While this opening was suspended in April owing to the COVID-19 crisis, disorder arising from the refugee issue continued—in September a large camp on the island of Lesbos, which was notorious for its poor living conditions, was destroyed by fire, with six suspects, all of them refugees, subsequently arrested.</p>
          <p>In November 2020 the Government announced that the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic had raised the national debt back to over 200%. Ministers even openly discussed the possible need for a new bailout, alarming the population, particularly in conjunction with planned laws to remove bankruptcy protection from individuals and end the exemption of primary residences from eviction proceedings. The period of optimism at the end of the first wave of the pandemic was now definitively over.</p>
          <p>Elsewhere, a new environmental law adopted in May 2020 was widely criticized as a dismantling of established environmental protection, particularly in the field of extractive industry, with consultation having been conducted during lockdown. In July the Government passed anti-protest legislation widely decried as authoritarian, and reportedly containing clauses copied from a 1971 junta-era legislative decree. Further restrictions on protests followed later in the year, including a failed attempt to establish a university police force in order to circumvent the constitutional ban on the national police’s activities on university campuses. In March 2021 Mitsotakis was forced to temper this trend, after video footage of a police officer beating a protester was widely broadcast by media outlets. He announced that police officers would henceforth wear body camera equipment—a move long resisted by the Greek police.</p>
          <p>In October 2020 the verdict in a lengthy trial against Chrysi Avgi was announced, after more than five years of proceedings; it was declared a criminal organization, and 38 senior members received prison sentences. The judges hearing the case made the unusual decision of exceeding the prosecutor’s demands in terms of sentencing, with widespread public concern about the possible exertion of influence on the prosecutor by Chrysi Avgi itself ensuing.</p>
          <p>Relations with Turkey deteriorated throughout 2020 and the first half of 2021, with numerous efforts by EU countries to sponsor a restoration of cordial relations proving unsuccessful, and the first round of bilateral talks in five years, convened in January, generating little progress. Incursions into Greece’s airspace and territorial waters (the latter by both military vessels and petroleum-surveying craft, in response to previous exploration around Cyprus) continued. The EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Josep Borrell Fontelles, in March 2021 issued a report citing improved attitudes on the part of Turkey since December 2020, a stance that Cyprus and Greece immediately rejected, in view of the territorial incursions (which persisted in 2022) and the alleged firing of weapons across the border at a German patrol detachment just a few days earlier. The Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 caused a number of European countries to attempt to improve traditionally difficult areas of bilateral relations, in an effort to present a united European position against Russia. Greece and Turkey were no exception, and technical contacts were followed by President Erdoğan receiving Mitsotakis for two days of talks in March, at which some progress on a number of contentious areas was reported. However, relations deteriorated once more in May, when Mitsotakis, during a visit to the USA, urged the US Congress not to sell new fighter aircraft to Turkey, prompting Erdoğan to declare that he would never meet Mitsotakis again. Nevertheless, contacts resumed later in 2022 and gradually increased during early 2023, despite continued disputes over military exercises and other territorial issues.</p>
          <p>Subsequent waves of COVID-19 proved much more lethal and enduring in Greece than the first, with case levels in excess of 3,000 new infections per day recorded in April 2021, causing private health facilities to be mobilized. The beginning of 2022 brought a new record in COVID-19 infections as the Omicron variant surged across Europe, with almost 250,000 cases reported in Greece during the first week of January. Unlike most of its European neighbours, Greece also suffered a record number of deaths related to COVID-19 in the Omicron wave, exceeding a previous high point in December 2020. Having declined by some 76% in 2020, tourism revenues more than doubled in 2021, as peak seasons for both bookings and travel coincided with periods of relatively low contagion in key markets such as the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Wildfires on a number of islands and in rural areas close to Athens in July and August 2021 did little to deter tourists.</p>
          <p>While Mitsotakis remained popular among the electorate, ND’s extremely high opinion poll ratings did not continue into 2022—largely because global high levels of inflation resulting from the war in Ukraine took effect in the Greek economy, but also in part because of a resurgence on the part of the newly reconstituted PASOK-led alliance, Kinima Allagis (KINAL—Movement for Change), renamed PASOK-KINAL. Mitsotakis rejected renewed clamour by some of his supporters for early elections, and committed to remaining in office until the final three months of his term. A scandal involving the Government’s alleged use of Predator spyware against opposition politicians and a number of other prominent public figures led to the resignation of the head of the National Intelligence Service, as well as Mitsotakis’s Chief of Staff (and nephew), Grigoris Dimitriadis, in August.</p>
          <p>On 28 February 2023 an express train travelling between Greece’s two largest cities, Athens and Thessaloniki, and a freight train collided in Tempi, Thessaly, killing 57 people and injuring 85 others. The incident appeared to have resulted primarily from human error, and highlighted the weakness of both the infrastructure and the human capital involved in Greece’s transport sector—a planned upgrade to the line had been delayed by several years, and the train operator, Hellenic Train, had been privatized and sold to Italian operator Trenitalia in 2017. Minister of Infrastructure and Transport Kostas Karamanlis (a cousin of the former Prime Minister of the same name) resigned in response, while protests erupted throughout the country, including a general strike led by transport workers and students (a key customer base for Greece’s railways). On 22 April the President approved a request by Mitsotakis to dissolve Parliament and legislative elections were scheduled for 21 May.</p>
          <p>
      The elections on 21 May 2023 were held under an amended electoral law constitutionally in effect after its introduction by SYRIZA in 2016, which abolished the `majority bonus’ of seats awarded to the most popular party, long a controversial feature of Greece’s electoral system, in favour of pure proportional representation. This was enough to cause ND to lose its majority, although the party increased its vote share slightly to 40.8%, securing 146 of the 300 seats in Parliament. In the absence of a prospective coalition between the parliamentary parties, Mitsotakis immediately decided to call further elections, which were scheduled for 25 June 2023—this time to be held under an electoral law introduced by ND in January 2020 which reinstated a `majority bonus’ system. At the second elections on 25 June, ND maintained its vote share (obtaining 40.6% of the votes cast) with a lower turnout of 52.8%, but due to the return of the modified system of bonus seats, this was enough for the party to secure 158 seats and a comfortable working majority. Mitsotakis’s move had proved successful—despite a number of scandals, it was clear that he was trusted by a plurality of Greek voters to remain in charge. SYRIZA was placed second in both elections, but with a sharply reduced vote share (taking 17.8% of the votes cast and 4
      
      7 seats in June), and with PASOK-KINAL beginning to threaten its primacy on the left. Tsipras resigned as leader of SYRIZA shortly after the June elections.
    </p>
          <p>The period between the elections may have been brief, but it was not without incident. The migration issue returned to prominence on 14 June 2023, when a fishing trawler carrying irregular migrants, who were estimated to number between 450 and 750 (about one-half of them Pakistani nationals), sank in international waters about 80&#160;km off the south-western coast of Greece. The vessel had departed from Tobruk, Libya, and was bound for an unknown destination in Italy. While 104 people were rescued, 82 were confirmed to have died, and more than 500 were believed missing, presumed dead. Nine Egyptian nationals were arrested in connection with the incident, and charged with offences including people trafficking, with homicide charges likely to follow. Varying accounts of the operation to rescue the vessel and the migrants on board emerged after the incident, with some claiming that the Greek and EU authorities had made insufficient efforts to save the ship’s passengers, while others reported that those on board had refused assistance. Protests occurred in major Greek cities on 15-16 June, but did not escalate into serious violence, and the impact on voting choices in the second elections appears to have been minimal.</p>
          <p>Greece had barely begun its recovery from its `lost decade’ of the 2010s when the COVID-19 outbreak began, and the toll on Greece has been substantial, particularly with the regional turmoil resulting from the war in Ukraine following closely afterwards. If Greece truly is a country that lurches from one crisis to another, then the pandemic and the war in Ukraine serve to emphasize that the previous debt crisis is now over—in as much as it ever will be—but that the 2010s left the country ill-equipped to prevent the incipient humanitarian crisis from growing in hospitals, refugee camps and in Greek waters. The financial crisis ruined a generation’s prospects, seriously damaged the country’s health care, transport and education systems, and made Greece a byword for chaotic politics and economic catastrophe. However, it can still reasonably be hoped that the exposure of the clientelism and patronage that characterized the Greek political system, along with the non-payment that was rife in the tax system and cronyism in politics, might help to bring about their reduction in future years. As the new crises of the 2020s reduce policy flexibility, the early results here appear mixed.</p>
