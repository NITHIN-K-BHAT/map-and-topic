                    <heading>The Constitution</heading>
                    <p id="GR.DIR.3">A new Constitution for the Hellenic Republic came into force on 11 June 1975. The main provisions of this Constitution, as subsequently amended, are summarized below.</p>
                    <p id="GR.DIR.4">Greece shall be a parliamentary democracy with a President as Head of State. All powers are derived from the people and exist for the benefit of the people. The established religion is that of The Eastern Orthodox Church of Christ.</p>

                              <p id="GR.DIR.8">The President is elected by the Vouli (Parliament) for a period of five years. The re-election of the same person shall be permitted only once. The President represents the state in relations with other nations, is Supreme Commander of the armed forces and may declare war and conclude treaties. The President shall appoint the Prime Minister and, on the Prime Minister’s recommendation, the other members of the Government. The President shall convoke Parliament once every year and in extraordinary session whenever he deems it reasonable. In exceptional circumstances, the President may preside over the Cabinet, convene the Council of the Republic, and suspend Parliament for a period not exceeding 30 days. The President can dissolve Parliament only if the resignation of two Governments in quick succession demonstrates the absence of political stability. If no party has a majority in Parliament, the President must offer an opportunity to form a government to the leader of each of the four biggest parties in turn, strictly following the order of their parliamentary strengths. If no party leader is able to form a government, the President may try to assemble an all-party government; failing that, the President must appoint a caretaker cabinet, led by a senior judge, to hold office until a fresh election takes place. The President possesses the right to object to legislation and may request Parliament to reconsider it or to approve it with an enlarged majority.</p>

                              <p id="GR.DIR.10">The Government consists of the Cabinet, which comprises the Prime Minister and Ministers. The Government determines and directs the general policy of the state in accordance with the Constitution and the laws. The Cabinet must enjoy the confidence of Parliament and may be removed by a vote of no confidence. The Prime Minister is to be the leader of the party with an absolute majority in Parliament, or, if no such party exists, the leader of the party with a relative majority.</p>

Parliament may impeach the President by a motion signed by one-third and approved by two-thirds of the total number of deputies. Parliament is also empowered to impeach present or former members of the Government. In these cases, the defendant shall be brought before an ad hoc tribunal presided over by the President of the Supreme Court and composed of 12 judges. Certain legislative work, as specified in the Constitution, must be approved by Parliament in plenum, and Parliament cannot make a decision without an absolute majority of the members present, which under no circumstances shall be less than one-quarter of the total number of deputies.

                         <p id="GR.DIR.16">Justice is to be administered by courts of regular judges, who enjoy personal and functional independence. The President, after consultations with a judicial council, shall appoint the judges for life. The judges are subject only to the Constitution and the law.
