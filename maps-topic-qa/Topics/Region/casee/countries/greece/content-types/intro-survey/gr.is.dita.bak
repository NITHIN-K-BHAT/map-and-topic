               <p id="GR.IS.3">The Hellenic Republic lies in South-Eastern Europe. The country consists mainly of a mountainous peninsula between the Medi­terranean Sea and the Aegean Sea, bounded to the north by Albania, North Macedonia and Bulgaria, and to the east by Türkiye (formerly known as Turkey). To the south, east and west of the mainland lie numerous Greek islands, of which the largest is Crete. The climate is Mediterranean, with mild winters and hot summers. The average temperature in the capital is 28°C (82°F) in July and 9°C (48°F) in January. The language is Greek, of which there are two forms—the formal language (katharevoussa), and the language commonly spoken and taught in schools (demotiki). Almost all of the inhabitants profess Christianity, principally (about 97%) adherents of the Greek Orthodox Church. The national flag (proportions 2 by 3) displays nine equal horizontal stripes of blue and white, with a white cross throughout a square canton of blue at the upper hoist. The capital is Athens (Athinai).</p>

                    <heading>Historical Context</heading>
                    <p id="GR.IS.5">The liberation of Greece from German occupation (1941-44) was followed by a civil war, which lasted until 1949. The communist forces were defeated, and the constitutional monarchy re-established. King Konstantinos (Constantine) II acceded to the throne on the death of his father, King Pavlos (Paul), in 1964. A succession of weak governments and conflicts between the King and his ministers culminated in a coup, led by right-wing army officers, in April 1967. An attempted counter-coup, led by the King, failed, and he went into exile. Col Georgios Papadopoulos became Prime Minister in December 1967 and Regent in March 1972.</p>
                    <p id="GR.IS.6">Following a failed naval mutiny, Greece was declared a republic in June 1973, and Papadopoulos was appointed Presi­dent. Martial law was ended, and a civilian Government was appointed. A student uprising in Athens in November was violently suppressed by the army, and Papadopoulos was overthrown by another military coup. Lt-Gen. Phaidon Ghizikis was appointed President, and a mainly civilian Government, led by Adamantios Androutsopoulos, was installed, but effective power lay with a small group of officers and the military police under Brig.-Gen. Demetrios Ioannides. Following the failure of the military junta’s attempt to overthrow President Makarios of Cyprus, and the Turkish invasion of the island, the Androutsopoulos administration collapsed in July 1974. Ghizikis summoned from exile a former Prime Minister, Kon­stantinos Karamanlis, who was invited to form a civilian Government of National Salvation. Martial law was ended and political parties were allowed to operate freely. A general election in November re­sulted in victory for Karamanlis’s Nea Dimokratia (ND—New Democracy). In June 1975 a new republican Constitution, providing for a parliamentary democracy, was promulgated. In the same month Prof. Konstantinos Tsatsos was elected President by the Vouli (Parliament).</p>
                    <p id="GR.IS.7">
          At legislative elections in November 1977 ND was returned to power. In May 1980 Karamanlis was elected President; Georgios Rallis subsequently assumed the leadership of ND and was appointed Prime Minister. On 1 January 1981 Greece acceded to the European Community (EC, now the 
          <xr pageref="Y" ref="WB02047.IO.TXT">European Union—EU</xr>
          ). The main opposition, the Panellinio Socialistiko Kinima (PASOK—Panhellenic Socialist Movement), secured a majority at elections to Parliament in October, and the PASOK leader, Andreas Papandreou, became Prime Minister.
        </p>
                    <p id="GR.IS.8">In March 1985 Karamanlis resigned in protest against plans by Papandreou to reduce his executive powers, and Parliament elected Christos Sartzetakis, a judge, as President. PASOK was returned to power at legislative elections in June. In March 1986 Parliament approved a series of constitutional amendments limiting the powers of the President. In early 1989 the Elliniki Aristera (Greek Left) party and the Exterior’ faction of the Kommunistiko Komma Ellados (KKE—Communist Party of Greece) formed an electoral alliance, the Synaspismos tis Aristeras kai tis Proodou (Synaspismos—Coalition of the Left and Progress). At elections in June, ND won the largest proportion of votes cast, but failed to attain a parliamentary majority; ND eventually formed an interim administration with Synaspismos, which resigned in October, having initiated investigations into alleged malpractice by officials of the former socialist administration. A new, non-party Government was appointed to oversee further legislative elections, held in November 1989, but the results were again inconclusive. ND, PASOK and Synaspismos formed an interim coalition, but the Government collapsed following divisions in February 1990, and the former administration was reinstated on an interim basis. Further elections, conducted in April, resolved the impasse; ND won 150 seats in the 300-member Parliament. ND leader Konstantinos Mitsotakis secured the support of Konstantinos Stefanopoulos, the leader of the Komma Dimokratikis Ananeosis (Party of Democratic Renewal), thereby enabling him to form a single-party Government. In May Karamanlis took office as President, following his election by 153 of the 300 members of Parliament.</p>

                    <heading>Domestic Political Affairs</heading>
                    <p id="GR.IS.13">In April 1992 Prime Minister Mitsotakis successfully sought a vote of confidence in Parliament, after dismissing the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Antonis Samaras, and assuming the portfolio himself in order to address attempts by the (then) former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia (FYRM) to achieve international recognition as the Republic of Macedonia (see below).</p>
                    <p id="GR.IS.14">In September 1993 the defection of two ND deputies to a new breakaway party established by Samaras resulted in the loss of Mitsotakis’s one-seat majority in Parliament, after which his Government resigned and early legislative elections were scheduled. On 10 October PASOK obtained 170 of the 300 parliamentary seats, while ND received 111 seats. PASOK formed a new Government, again headed by Papandreou.</p>
                    <p id="GR.IS.17">In March 1995 Stefanopoulos was elected President by 181 votes cast in Parliament. In November Papandreou was admitted to hospital, and on 15 January 1996 he submitted his resignation as Prime Minister. Three days later, Simitis was elected to the premiership by the PASOK parliamentary faction. Simitis awarded Theodoros Pangalos the foreign affairs portfolio, and pro-European ministers replaced the majority of Papan­dreou’s former associates. Following Papandreou’s death in June, Simitis was elected leader of PASOK. In early legislative elections, held on 22 September, PASOK won 162 of the 300 parliamentary seats, with 41.5% of the votes cast, while ND (with 38.2%) obtained 108 seats. Principal ministers in the outgoing Government were retained. In March 1997 Konstantinos (Kostas) Karamanlis (a nephew of the former President and ND party leader) was elected leader of ND.</p>
                    <p id="GR.IS.24">In February 1999 it emerged that dissident Kurdish leader Abdullah Öcalan, charged with terrorism by Turkey (officially redesignated as Türkiye from mid-2022), had been given refuge at the Greek embassy in Kenya, before being detained by the Turkish authorities. The Ministers of the Interior, Public Administration and Decentralization, of Foreign Affairs, and of Public Order resigned, prompting a government reorganization, in which Georgios Papandreou (the son of the late Andreas Papandreou) became Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>
                    <p id="GR.IS.25">On 9 February 2000 Stefanopoulos was re-elected as President by 269 votes cast in Parliament. At early legislative elections on 9 April, PASOK won 43.8% of the votes and 158 seats, narrowly defeating ND, with 42.7% of the votes and 125 seats. On 12 April Simitis formed a new Government. He reorganized the Government in October 2001. In January 2004 Simitis announced his resignation from the leadership of PASOK, and scheduled early legislative elections for 7 March, asserting that an administration with a new mandate was necessary to address developments on the issue of Cyprus (see below). On 8 February Georgios Papandreou was elected as President of PASOK.</p>
                    <p>At the legislative elections held on 7 March 2004, ND secured 45.4% of the votes cast and 165 seats, thereby removing PASOK, which retained 117 seats (with 40.6%), from government. A new administration, headed by Karamanlis, was installed on 10 March. In November the Government publicly conceded that the PASOK administration had significantly understated public debt and budgetary deficit figures for several years in order for Greece to qualify for membership of the EU’s economic and monetary union in January 2001, after evidence to that effect emerged. The statement provoked a dispute between the ruling ND and PASOK, which criticized the revision of past official figures. On 8 February 2005 Karolos Papoulias of PASOK, a former Minister of Foreign Affairs, was elected unopposed as President, receiving 279 votes in Parliament.</p>

                         <p>At legislative elections conducted on 16 September 2007 ND was returned to power, securing 41.8% of the votes cast and 152 seats in Parliament. PASOK, with 38.1% of the votes, won 102 seats, followed by the KKE (with 8.2% of votes and 22 seats) and Synaspismos Rizospastikís Aristeras (SYRIZA—Coalition of the Radical Left—5.0% of votes and 14 seats); an extreme nationalist organization, Laikos Orthodoxos Synagermos (LAOS—Popular Orthodox Rally), received 3.8% of the votes and 10 seats, obtaining parliamentary representation for the first time. The rate of participation by the electorate was 74.1%. Karamanlis subsequently established a smaller administration.</p>
                         <p>The international financial crisis from late 2008 exacerbated economic hardship and public discontent. On 6 December a student was shot and killed by a police officer in an impoverished district of Athens, precipitating riots in Athens, Thessaloniki and other towns. Students occupied universities and schools in Athens and Thessaloniki. A national strike on 10 December, organized by public sector unions, developed into more general protests against further austerity measures. (In September 2010 a police officer was sentenced to life imprisonment for the killing of the student.)</p>
                         <p>At elections to the European Parliament on 7 June 2009, PASOK secured eight seats, ND obtained eight seats, while the KKE and LAOS each won two seats; 52.6% of the registered electorate participated. On 2 September Karamanlis requested the dissolution of Parliament, and announced that legislative elections (due in September 2011) would be brought forward to October 2009. In the elections, held on 4 October, PASOK secured 43.9% of the votes cast and 160 seats, while ND received 33.5% of the votes and 91 seats; the KKE received 7.5% and 21 seats, LAOS 5.6% and 15 seats, and SYRIZA 4.6% and 13 seats. The rate of participation was 70.9% of the registered electorate. In response to the party’s defeat, Karamanlis resigned as President of ND; he was succeeded, in November, by Samaras (who had rejoined the party in 2004). The President of PASOK, Papandreou, appointed a new Government, which won a motion of confidence in Parliament on 19 October 2009; Papandreou assumed the foreign affairs portfolio, in addition to the premiership, while former Minister of Foreign Affairs Theodoros Pangalos became a Deputy Prime Minister. In December the adoption of an austerity budget by Parliament prompted further public protests and national strikes, which frequently escalated into violent clashes. A new programme of spending reductions and tax increases (opposed by ND) was adopted by Parliament on 5 March 2010.</p>
                         <p>Meanwhile, on 3 February 2010 President Papoulias was elected, again unopposed, by Parliament for a further term of office, obtaining the support of 266 deputies. On 2 May the EU, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Central Bank (ECB) `troika’ reached agreement with Greece on a €110,000m. austerity programme intended to stabilize the Greek economy, which was adopted by Parliament four days later. (Three PASOK deputies who had opposed the motion were expelled from the party.) Meanwhile, on 5 May a large-scale demonstration in Athens against the planned measures escalated into violence, and protesters attempted to occupy the parliamentary building; three people died when a fire was started at a bank.</p>
                         <p>Although trade unions continued to organize demonstrations and nationwide strike action, further reforms to the pension system were adopted in Parliament in July 2010. On 7 September Prime Minister Papandreou undertook an extensive government reorganization, under which the foreign affairs portfolio was transferred to Deputy Prime Minister Pangalos. At local elections, which took place on 7 and 14 November, PASOK narrowly defeated ND, despite a significant loss of support.</p>

                         <heading>Deepening Fiscal Crisis</heading>
                         <p>On 17 June 2011 Papandreou again reorganized the Government; Georgios Papaconstantinou was replaced as Minister of Finance by Evangelos Venizelos, hitherto the Minister of National Defence, who also became a deputy premier. At the end of June, amid a national strike and violent protests outside the parliament building, Parliament approved a programme of austerity measures, prescribed by the EU and the IMF in order to allow the release of further emergency funds. On 21 July, at a summit meeting, held in Brussels, Belgium, eurozone leaders agreed the terms of a new rescue plan for Greece.</p>
                         <p>At the beginning of October 2011 the Government acknowledged that it would not meet budget deficit targets agreed with the EU and the IMF, and agreed further measures, which included retrenchment in the state sector. On 20 October, as a protest by some 100,000 people outside the parliamentary building escalated into violent clashes, Parliament adopted the new austerity measures. At a summit meeting in Brussels on 26-27 October, eurozone leaders reached an agreement intended to reverse the escalating sovereign debt crisis. A second emergency funding plan of €130,000m. was conditionally approved (after it had become evident that the programme agreed in July was inadequate to prevent a Greek debt default).</p>
                         <p>At the end of October 2011, however, Papandreou unexpectedly announced that the new rescue plan would require endorsement at a national referendum, and the disbursement of funds was again suspended. Papandreou subsequently agreed to abandon the proposed referendum, following criticism from within the Government and PASOK. On 5 November Papand­reou’s Government narrowly survived a vote of confidence in Parliament. Nevertheless, since ND remained unwilling to participate in a transitional government headed by Papandreou, he announced his resignation on the following day. On 10 November Lucas Papademos, a former Vice-President of the ECB, received a presidential mandate to establish a transitional coalition administration. Early legislative elections, initially scheduled for February 2012, were later postponed until May.</p>
                         <p>In early February 2012 LAOS withdrew its four representatives from the governing coalition, in protest against the required austerity measures. The measures were formally adopted by 199 votes to 74 in Parliament on 12 February, while violent protests took place in central Athens. On 21 February the `Eurogroup’ of eurozone finance ministers formally agreed the second rescue plan, with a number of additional preconditions. Amid continuing anti-austerity protests, Parliament began to adopt reforms in accordance with EU requirements, and agreement was reached on debt restructuring. In mid-March eurozone member states and the IMF approved joint financing amounting to some €172,600m. over four years, and the first critical EU instalment was subsequently released. On 20 March Venizelos announced his resignation as Minister of Finance, following his election as PASOK leader.</p>

                         <heading>Revised Rescue Plan</heading>
                         <p>The legislative elections were conducted on 6 May 2012: ND obtained 108 seats, SYRIZA 52 seats and PASOK 41 seats. After attempts to form a governing coalition were unsuccessful, new elections were scheduled, and an interim administration was installed, headed by Panagiotis Pikrammenos (hitherto the President of the supreme administrative court, the Council of State). At the legislative elections held on 17 June ND won 29.7% of the votes and 129 seats in Parliament, while SYRIZA secured 71 seats and PASOK won 33 seats. Four smaller parties also obtained representation, including the extreme nationalist Chrysi Avgi (Golden Dawn), which took 18 seats. On 21 June a new Government was formed under the premiership of ND President Samaras, who had reached a coalition agreement with PASOK and the small Dimokratiki Aristera (DIMAR—Democratic Left) party. Ioannis Stournaras, an independent economist, became Minister of Finance in the new administration, which was approved by Parliament on 8 July.</p>
                         <p>In September 2012 discussions with the EU-IMF-ECB troika were suspended, pending the finalization of further austerity measures by the Government, resulting in a delay in the disbursement of a critical loan instalment. Large anti-austerity demonstrations were organized to coincide with the visit to Athens of German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel on 9 October. Essential legislation on privatization was narrowly approved in Parliament at the end of October. Despite further violent protests and strike action, in early November new, stringent measures, which included a two-year increase in the retirement age, were adopted in Parliament. One ND representative and six PASOK deputies were subsequently expelled from their respective parties owing to their failure to support the programme. On 27 November the troika reached agreement on the disbursement of funds and on further concessions for the reduction of Greece’s debt. In early December, in fulfilment of an additional condition, Greece succeeded in purchasing about €31,800m. of its debt from holders of sovereign bonds.</p>
                         <p>In an effort to meet redundancy targets imposed by the troika, in early June 2013 the Government announced the closure of the state radio and television broadcasting network, ERT, despite the opposition of PASOK and DIMAR, prompting public protests. Although PASOK subsequently reached consensus with ND, on 21 June DIMAR withdrew from the Government. As part of an ensuing government reorganization, Samaras appointed PASOK leader Venizelos as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>

                         <p>Amid reports that members of Chrysi Avgi were staging a campaign of intimidation against immigrants, in September 2013 an anti-fascist activist, Pavlos Fyssas, was killed by a supporter of Chrysi Avgi in the outskirts of Athens. At least 10 members of the organization were arrested in connection with the murder, which prompted nationwide protests. Later in September senior members, including Chrysi Avgi’s leader, Nikolaos Michaloliakos, and six prominent parliamentary deputies, were arrested on charges of organizing a criminal group. In October Parliament voted in favour of removing the parliamentary immunity of the six deputies, and of suspending state financing for political parties whose leaders were charged with serious crimes.</p>
                         <p>Meanwhile, in September and November 2013 public sector workers staged further nationwide strikes in protest against plans for continued retrenchment in the civil service. The Government survived a parliamentary vote of no confidence on 11 November, which had been proposed in response to a police raid on ERT offices earlier that month. Following a further delay in funding, in March 2014 it was announced that agreement had been reached on the release of some €10,000m.</p>
                         <p>At elections to the European Parliament on 25 May 2014, SYRIZA secured six of the 21 seats available, ND obtained five, while Chrysi Avgi won three. A recently formed left-wing alliance led by PASOK, Elia—Dimokratiki Parataki (Olive Tree—Democratic Realignment), obtained two seats. A centrist party formed by television presenter Stavros Theodorakis, To Potami (The River), also obtained two seats, as did the KKE, and the right-wing Anexartitoi Ellines (ANEL—Independent Greeks) secured one seat. The rate of participation was 58.2%.</p>
                         <p>In June 2014 it was announced that Stournaras was to become Governor of the Bank of Greece. He was succeeded as Minister of Finance by Gikas Hardouvelis, as part of an extensive government reorganization. In October the state prosecutor recommended that all Chrysi Avgi parliamentary deputies be placed on trial on charges including organizing and participating in a criminal group, weapons possession, and responsibility for murder. The trial of 69 Chrysi Avgi members, including Michaloliakos and all former deputies, began in April 2015.</p>

                         <heading>SYRIZA Electoral Victory</heading>
                         <p>Following a progressive increase in the popularity of anti-austerity party SYRIZA, in early December 2014 Samaras brought forward a parliamentary vote to elect a new President. After Samaras’s nominated candidate, former European Commissioner Stavros Dimas, failed to secure election after a third round of voting, Parliament was dissolved on 31 December, and early legislative elections were scheduled for 25 January 2015. As widely predicted, SYRIZA secured victory in the elections (although it was narrowly short of a majority), with 36.3% of the votes cast and 149 seats, while ND’s representation declined sharply, to 27.8% of the votes and 76 seats. Chrysi Avgi received 6.3% and 17 seats. To Potami, with 6.1% of the votes, entered Parliament, securing 17 seats; the KKE obtained 5.5% and 15 seats, ANEL 4.8% and 13 seats, and PASOK (also suffering a significant loss of support) 4.7% and 13. The leader of SYRIZA, Alexis Tsipras, reached a coalition agreement with ANEL (which also opposed the bailout agreement). His Government, largely comprising SYRIZA members, was formed on 27 January. Ioannis Dragasakis was appointed Deputy Prime Minister, while Yanis Varoufakis, formerly an economic adviser to premier Georgios Papandreou, became Minister of Finance. Tsipras nominated Prokopis Pavlopoulos as the new President, and on 18 February Pavlopoulos was elected by Parliament, with the support of 233 votes. He was inaugurated on 13 March.</p>
                         <p>In accordance with pre-election pledges, Tsipras entered into negotiations with the troika in an effort to secure concessionary terms for the funded bailout agreement, which was due to expire on 28 February 2015. In early February the ECB announced that it would no longer accept Greek bonds in exchange for loan-funding, increasing pressure on Greece’s central bank. Tsipras abandoned aspirations for a large-scale debt cancellation, and on 24 February the Government presented a revised programme of policy measures. After the proposals were accepted by the Eurogroup, Greece was granted a four-month extension of its bailout programme.</p>
                         <p>In June 2015 a new bailout plan, which entailed the continuation of stringent austerity measures, was presented by the troika. After suspending negoti­ations, on 27 June Tsipras announced that a referendum would be held to decide whether to accept the bailout conditions. On the following day he announced the imposition of capital controls, and the temporary closure of the country’s banks, in an attempt to avert financial collapse. At the end of June Greece defaulted on a delayed loan repayment to the IMF and formally exited the bailout programme, after the ECB refused to extend the existing agreement. At the national referendum on 5 July, the conditions required by the troika in return for continued financial assistance were rejected by 61.3% of the votes cast, with 62.5% of the electorate participating. On the following day Varoufakis announced his resignation, and was replaced as Minister of Finance by Euclid Tsakalotos; former premier Samaras also resigned as leader of ND.</p>

                         <p>After PASOK and To Potami agreed to support the Government in resumed negotiations, on 8 July 2015 Greece made a formal request for new lending under the EU’s European Stability Mechanism (ESM). On 12 July a eurozone summit reached provisional agreement on a further lending programme, subject to the implementation of additional austerity measures, including tax rises, pensions reform and a transfer of national assets to a privatization fund to be controlled by the lenders. Four days later, amid violent anti-austerity protests in the capital, Parliament approved initial measures, with 229 voting in favour and 64 (including 32 SYRIZA deputies) against. On 17 July Tsipras reorganized the Government, removing members who had opposed the new bailout programme. Banks reopened three days later, although capital controls remained in force. The new, three-year bailout agreement, under which Greece would receive up to €86,000m. in financial assistance, was approved by a parliamentary vote on 14 August. On 20 August the ESM Board of Directors authorized the first tranche of lending. However, since a large number of SYRIZA party deputies had refused to support the motion, on the same day Tsipras submitted the resignation of his Government and scheduled parliamentary elections for 20 September.</p>
                         <p>On 20 September 2015 SYRIZA was returned to government, with 35.5% of the votes cast and 145 seats; ND secured 28.1% of the votes and 75 seats, Chrysi Avgi 7.0% and 18 seats, an alliance of PASOK and DIMAR 6.3% and 17 seats, and the KKE 5.6% and 15 seats. However, a reduced rate of voter participation, of 56.6%, was recorded. Tsipras welcomed the results as a validation of the new bailout arrangement, and formed a new coalition Government, which was installed on 23 September.</p>
                         <p>On 19 November 2015 austerity reforms, including regulations on property foreclosures, were approved by Parliament; two deputies of the ruling coalition who had voted against the measures were expelled, reducing the Government’s parliamentary majority. However, government plans to introduce social security reforms, involving increases in tax and pension contributions, prompted a nationwide general strike on 4 February 2016 (when violent clashes were reported). Protests continued against the partial privatization of Piraeus Port Authority, in addition to the stringent pension reforms. The first review of the ESM programme, due in October 2015, was finally completed on 24 May 2016, shortly after additional tax measures had been adopted by Parliament.</p>
                         <p>In October 2016 Tsipras was re-elected unopposed as leader of SYRIZA. He announced a government reorganization in early November, in which three far-left members who had opposed planned economic reforms were replaced, and three ministers unaffiliated to the governing parties were appointed.</p>

                         <p>Amid continued pressure, on 5 December 2016 the Eurogroup, meeting in Brussels, endorsed an ESM plan of short-term measures to reduce Greece’s debt costs. Following a further impasse in negotiations between Greece and its creditors, on 20 February 2017 the Government agreed, in principle, to undertake additional reforms of taxes, pensions and the labour market, with the aim of securing approval of a further loan disbursement. At the beginning of May the Government reached agreement on the detail of the new fiscal and structural reforms, which included a commitment to reduce pensions by some 18%. On 18 May, amid violent protests outside the parliamentary building, and a general strike the preceding day, Parliament approved the new reforms. Further legislative amendments were approved in early June.</p>

            In mid-June 2017, following a Eurogroup meeting in Luxembourg, it was announced that agreement had been reached in principle on structural measures to permit the successful completion of the second review of the ESM programme, and provide for the participation of the IMF in the bailout arrangement. On 7 July the ESM Board of Directors approved the disbursement of a tranche of lending (prior to further imminent default by Greece on repayments due in the following month). At the beginning of August the former Chairman of the Hellenic Statistical Authority was given a suspended sentence by an appeals court in Athens, following accusations that he had inflated budget deficit figures for 2009, thereby compelling the country to seek international lending.
          </p>
                         <p>On 15 January 2018 Parliament approved measures demanded by the country’s international creditors in exchange for the disbursement of further bailout funds; in addition to fiscal and energy market reforms, the legislation provided for a controversial labour amendment on strike action, prompting a protest outside the parliamentary building. At the beginning of March the Eurogroup announced that Greece had met all the prerequisites for the disbursement of new lending; accordingly, a further tranche was authorized on 27 March.</p>

                         <heading>Conflict over the Prespa Agreement</heading>
                         <p>
            On 16 June 2018 the parliamentary faction of ND unsuccessfully brought a motion of no confidence against Tsipras, one day before his signature of the historic Prespa Agreement, providing for the renaming of the FYRM as the Republic of North Macedonia (see 
            <i>Foreign Affairs</i>
            ), which met with significant opposition in both countries. On 22 June the Eurogroup reached agreement on debt relief for Greece (see 
            <i>Economic Affairs</i>
            ), prior to its formal departure from the rescue programme. The Minister of Civil Protection submitted his resignation in early August, after the Government’s response to forest fires near Athens, which had resulted in at least 97 deaths, was strongly criticized.
          </p>
                         <p>The final tranche of ESM financial assistance for Greece was disbursed on 6 August 2018, and Greece exited the third bailout programme, as scheduled, on 20 August. A government reorganization was effected several days later. In mid-October Minister of Foreign Affairs Nikos Kotzias resigned, after clashing with Minister of National Defence and ANEL leader Panos Kammenos, who strenuously opposed the agreement with the FYRM. With elections due to take place by the following October, Tsipras pledged to reverse some of the stringent austerity measures implemented. Nevertheless, in mid-November a one-day public-sector strike was organized (the first since the country’s exit from the bailout arrangement) in support of demands for wage and pensions increases.</p>
                         <p>On 13 January 2019 Kammenos resigned as Minister of National Defence, after announcing his party’s withdrawal from the coalition Government, in protest against the planned ratification of the Prespa Agreement; he was replaced by Adm. Evangelos Apostolakis, hitherto chief of the Hellenic National Defence General Staff. On 16 January Tsipras won a legislative motion of confidence with 151 votes, after securing the support of four members of ANEL and one member of To Potami. An estimated 60,000 people demonstrated in opposition to the agreement with the FYRM in Athens on 20 January, with clashes ensuing between demonstrators and police. A further, smaller protest took place outside Parliament prior to the vote on the Prespa Agreement on 25 January, when it was ratified by a narrow majority of 153 votes to 146 (ND refused to support the agreement), and signed into law shortly afterwards. Georgios Katrougalos succeeded Kotzias as Minister of Foreign Affairs in mid-February, as part of a government reorganization.</p>
                         <p>On 29 March 2019 Parliament adopted a more stringent framework on the protection of primary residences from foreclosure, after which the Eurogroup approved the release of the first payment of post-bailout debt relief on 5 April. However, in early May, following improved fiscal performance, Tsipras pledged to reduce taxes on a number of goods and to raise pensions. The Tsipras Government won a further parliamentary vote of confidence on 10 May.</p>

                         <heading>SYRIZA Defeat and ND’s Return to Government</heading>
                         <p>At elections to the European Parliament on 26 May 2019, ND secured eight seats, while SYRIZA won six. A PASOK-led coalition known as Kinima Allagis (KINAL—Movement for Change—later renamed PASOK-KINAL), the KKE and Chrysi Avgi each won two seats, and the right-wing Elliniki Lisi (EL—Greek Solution) won one seat. The rate of participation by the electorate was recorded at 58.7%. The first round of regional and municipal elections took place concurrently on 26 May, with a second round on 2 June: ND candidates were successful in most of the country’s 13 regions, and the majority of large towns, including Athens. Owing to the dramatic loss in support for SYRIZA (and in accordance with ND demands), Tsipras tendered his resignation on 10 June; at his request, President Pavlopoulos dissolved Parliament and early legislative elections were scheduled for 7 July.</p>
                         <p>ND again emerged as the leading party on 7 July 2019, securing an outright majority in the legislature, with 39.9% of the votes cast and 158 seats, while SYRIZA received 31.5% of the votes and 86 seats. Kinima Allagis was placed third, with 8.1% of the votes and 22 seats. The KKE won 5.3% of the votes and 10 seats, while two newly formed parties also obtained representation: EL won 3.7% of the votes and 10 seats and the left-wing Metopo Evropaikis Realistikis Anypakois (European Realistic Disobedience Front), led by former Minister of Finance Varoufakis, 3.4% of the votes and nine seats. The loss of support for SYRIZA was largely attributed to perceived concessions made by Tsipras under the Prespa Agreement.</p>
                         <p>Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the leader of ND since 2016 (and the son of former premier Konstantinos Mitsotakis), was sworn in as Prime Minister on 8 July 2019. His new coalition Government, which was installed on the following day, included several technocrats. Former interim premier Pikrammenos, an ND representative, was appointed as Deputy Prime Minister; Nikos Dendias of ND became Minister of Foreign Affairs. Economic reforms presented by Mitsotakis were approved by Parliament on 24 October, despite union-led protests and industrial action organized from late September.</p>
                         <p>
                              <!--https://government.gov.gr/kivernisi/-->
            Following a resurgence in migrant arrivals (see 
            <i>Foreign Affairs</i>
            ), in mid-January 2020 Mitsotakis created a Ministry of Migration and Asylum, appointing Panagiotis Mitarakis of ND to the new post. On 22 January Parliament elected Katerina Sakellaropoulou, hitherto the President of the Council of State, as the country’s President, in a single round of voting. Sakellaropoulou was inaugurated on 13 March.
          </p>
                         <p>In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a ban on all non-essential travel and movement throughout the country was imposed with effect from 23 March 2020. The restrictions were progressively lifted from 4 May. On 9 July Parliament approved legislation which allowed demonstrations to be prohibited if they were considered by the authorities to threaten public safety; around 10,000 people gathered outside the parliamentary building to protest against the measures, and violent clashes with police were reported. New lockdown restrictions were imposed from 7 November.</p>
                         <p>
                              <!--https://www.ekathimerini.com/258360/article/ekathimerini/news/gd-leadership-heading-to-jail-after-court-ruling-->
            On 7 October 2020 the Athens Court of Appeal ruled that the leadership of Chrysi Avgi was guilty of running a criminal organization; other defendants were found guilty of charges including involvement in violent attacks. Later that month Chrysi Avgi leader Michaloliakos and several prominent former parliamentary deputies were sentenced to 13 years’ imprisonment; 12 other former deputies were sentenced to prison terms of between five and 10 years, while a supporter of Chrysi Avgi was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of Fyssas in 2013. Twelve people reportedly received suspended sentences. Two senior figures convicted 
            <i>in absentia</i>
             were arrested in 2021—Ioannis Lagos, a member of the European Parliament (MEP), was detained in Brussels in April and extradited to Greece, and former deputy party leader Christos Pappas was arrested in Athens in July.
          </p>
                         <p>Meanwhile, Mitsotakis effected a minor government reorganization in early January 2021, and Makis Voridis became the new Minister of the Interior. On 13 January draft legislation on university regulations, providing for the establishment of a police division at campuses, was presented to Parliament. Despite the continued pandemic-related ban on gatherings, students and teachers protested against the proposed measures in both Athens and Thessaloniki, clashing with police. Nevertheless, the legislation received parliamentary approval on 11 February. Further protests were precipitated in early March, after video footage emerged that appeared to show police officers with responsibility for enforcing COVID-19 restrictions beating a man in a residential area of Athens; three officers were reportedly injured. The pandemic-related restrictions were eventually lifted in May. </p>
                         <p>In July and August 2021 a series of wildfires broke out, reaching the outskirts of Athens. The Government’s response was widely criticized, and Mitsotakis consequently reorganized his cabinet, appointing Panagiotis (Takis) Theodorikakos, a former Minister of the Interior, as Minister of Citizen Protection. Vassilis Kikilias received the tourism portfolio, and was succeeded as Minister of Health by Athanasios Plevris. Mitsotakis also created a new Ministry of Climate Crisis and Civil Protection, led by former Cypriot MEP Christos Stylianides. Further destructive wildfires broke out during 2022, with the official response again attracting criticism.</p>
                         <p>In early August 2022 allegations that the Government had used Predator surveillance software (`spyware’) against opposition politicians and a number of other prominent public figures, including PASOK-KINAL President Nikos Androulakis, prompted the resignation of Mitsotakis’s Chief of Staff (and nephew), Grigoris Dimitriadis, and the director of the National Intelligence Service (NIS), Panagiotis Kontoleon. On 8 August Mitsotakis made a televised statement, in which he denied knowledge of the illicit surveillance of Androulakis, although opposition critics noted that the NIS had been brought under the direct control of Mitsotakis after he took office in 2019. In late January 2023 SYRIZA unsuccessfully brought a parliamentary motion of no confidence against Mitsotakis’s Government, in part motivated by the surveillance scandal.</p>
                         <p>On 28 February 2023 a passenger train travelling from Athens to Thessaloniki collided with a freight train north of Greece’s fourth largest city, Larissa, killing 57 people and injuring more than 80 others. Initial investigations indicated that the accident had been caused by human error. On 1 March the Minister of Infrastructure and Transport Kostas Karamanlis (a cousin of the former Prime Minister of the same name) resigned, as did the head of the railway operating company. Giorgios Gerapetritis was appointed to succeed Karamanlis. Protests at the dilapidated state of Greek railway infrastructure followed in Athens and Thessaloniki.</p>
                         <p>Meanwhile, in February 2023 Parliament voted to ban parties led by politicians with criminal convictions from contesting forthcoming national elections, notably including the Ethniko Komma—Ellines (National Party—Greeks), which had been created by a former Chrysi Avgi parliamentary deputy. In late March Mitsotakis scheduled the legislative elections for 21 May, and on 22 April President Sakellaropoulou approved a request by Mitsotakis to dissolve Parliament.</p>

                         <p>
            In the parliamentary elections on 21 May 2023, ND secured 40.8% of the votes cast; SYRIZA secured 20.1% of the votes, while PASOK-KINAL was third-placed, with 11.5% of the votes. However, under amendments to electoral law (which had been adopted in 2016 
            <!--https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/greece-changes-electoral-law-then-changes-it-back/-->
            and, despite their subsequent reversal, constitutionally entered into effect for the 2023 polls) abolishing the `majority bonus’ system of additional seats awarded to the first-placed party, ND failed to attract sufficient support to enable it to form a government. An interim Government, headed by senior judge Ioannis Sarmas, took office on 26 May, and new elections were scheduled for 25 June.
          </p>
                         <p>ND obtained 40.6% of the votes cast in the repeated legislative elections on 25 June 2023 (with a voter turnout of 53.7%), and, following the reinstatement of the `majority bonus’ system, secured a comfortable majority of 158 seats in Parliament. SYRIZA received 17.8% of the votes and 47 seats, and PASOK-KINAL 11.8% and 32 seats. The KKE, with 7.7% of the votes, took 21 seats, while the far-right Spartiates (Spartans—4.7%) and EL (4.4%) each obtained 12 seats, the Dimokratiko Patriotiko Kinima (Democratic Patriotic Movement—3.7%) 10 seats, and the populist Plefsi Eleftherias (Course of Freedom—3.2%) eight seats. A new Government, again under the premiership of Mitsotakis, and comprising ND members and three independents, was sworn in on 27 June. Principal ministers included ND Vice-President Kostis Hatzidakis as Minister of National Economy and Finance, Gerapetritis as Minister of Foreign Affairs, succeeding Dendias, who became Minister of National Defence, and Niki Kerameus, previously Minister of Education and Religious Affairs, as Minister of the Interior. Following SYRIZA’s electoral defeat, Tsipras resigned from the leadership of the party on 29 June.</p>
                         <p>In July 2023 wildfires again broke out at several mainland and island locations in Greece, particularly in Rhodes, where a state of emergency was declared and mass evacuations undertaken. The Minister of Citizen Protection, Notis Mitarakis, resigned later that month, reportedly at the demand of Mitsotakis following his absence from Athens on vacation during the crisis. In early August large-scale violent clashes between supporters of the Greek and Croatian football teams, prior to a match in Athens, resulted in the death of a Greek supporter. A total of 102 Croatians and three Greek citizens were subsequently charged in connection with the violence and placed in pre-trial detention (causing some tensions between the Governments of Greece and Croatia). Heavy storm flooding killed at least 17 people and caused widespread agricultural and infrastructural damage in Thessaly during early September.</p>
                         <p>A US-educated former investment banker, Stefanos Kasselakis, was elected as the new President of SYRIZA on 24 September 2023. Following efforts by Kasselakis to restructure SYRIZA, in November several legislative deputies and a large number of central committee members announced their withdrawal from the party. In early December 11 independent deputies who had defected from SYRIZA formed a breakaway party, Nea Aristera (New Left).</p>
                         <p>Prime Minister Mitsotakis effected a minor government reorganization on 3 January 2024, as part of which Michalis Chrysochoidis, hitherto the Minister of Health, was appointed Minister of Citizen Protection, and was succeeded in his previous post by Adonis Georgiades (previously the Minister of Labour and Social Security). Later in January farmers began to stage protests in many regions of the country to demand reductions in production costs and further compensation payments for the extreme weather conditions of the previous year.</p>
                         <p>Following intensive parliamentary debate, in mid-February 2024 legislation proposed by the Government that legalized same sex marriage and granted parental rights to same sex couples was approved by Parliament with 176 votes in favour and 76 against (Greece thereby becoming the first Orthodox Christian country to adopt such legislation). The draft measures had encountered opposition, particularly from the Greek Orthodox Church and far-right parties, prompting a protest rally in Athens a few days before the parliamentary vote. SYRIZA criticized limitations in the new reforms, including a continued ban on same sex couples becoming parents through surrogacy.</p>

                         <p id="GR.IS.31">Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s bomb attacks against military and commercial targets in Greece were carried out by dissident groups, in particular the extremist left-wing Epanastatiki Organosi dekaefta Noemvri (17N—November 17 Revolutionary Organization), active from 1975, and the Epanastatikos Laikos Agonas (ELA—Revolutionary People’s Struggle). In June 2000 a British defence attaché was assassinated by the 17N group. The movement’s leader, Alexandros Giotopoulos, was arrested in July 2002. Subsequently, the Government announced that 17N had been disbanded. In December 2003 Giotopoulos and five others were sentenced to life imprisonment. In October five members of the ELA, including the movement’s leader, were sentenced to 25 years’ imprisonment.</p>
                         <p id="GR.IS.200303271605">The extremist, left-wing Epanastatikos Agonas (EA—Revolutionary Struggle), which emerged in 2003, claimed responsibility for bomb attacks, including a rocket attack against the US embassy in Athens in January 2007. A group believed to be affiliated to the EA, the Sechta ton Epanastaton (SE—Sect of Revolutionaries), in June 2009 claimed responsibility for the killing of a police officer. In September four terrorist suspects, alleged to be members of the previously unknown Synomosia Pyrinon Tis Fotias (SPF—Conspiracy of Fire Nuclei), were arrested on charges related to a bomb attack at the residence of a former minister in July, and against a PASOK parliamentary deputy earlier in September (in July 2011 six SPF members were imprisoned for between 11 and 25 years). In June 2010 a ministry employee was killed by a parcel bomb. In November the SPF claimed responsibility for the dispatch of parcel bombs to several embassies in Athens, as well as to foreign government headquarters and embassies abroad. Amid social unrest, in January 2013 incendiary attacks, widely attributed to left-wing anarchist groups, were staged against party headquarters, the residences of journalists and commercial premises, while a gun attack took place at the office of Prime Minister Antonis Samaras. In May 2017 former Prime Minister Lucas Papademos was injured as the result of a letter bomb. A prominent leader of the EA, Paula Roupa, was sentenced to life imprisonment in July 2018, in connection with bomb attacks in 2014.</p>
                         <p>In early February 2024 a bomb exploded outside the Ministry of Labour and Social Security in Athens (with no resulting casualties). A new grouping, the self-styled Epanastatiki Taxiki Aftoamyna (Revolutionary Class Self-Defence), claimed responsibility for the incident, which prompted official concerns about the resumption of terrorist attacks in the country.</p>

                    <p id="GR.IS.34">Relations with Türkiye (as Turkey was officially redesignated in mid-2022) have been characterized by longstanding disputes concerning Cyprus (q.v.) and sovereignty over the continental shelf beneath the Aegean Sea. Tensions were exacerbated by the unilateral dec­laration of an independent’ Turkish Cypriot state in Cyprus in November 1983 (the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus’—TRNC’). In March 1987 a Greco-Turkish disagreement over petroleum-prospecting rights in disputed areas of the Aegean Sea almost resulted in military conflict. In early 1996 tensions again rose, owing to conflicting claims of sovereignty over Imia (Kardak), a group of uninhabited islands in the Aegean Sea.</p>
                    <p id="GR.IS.37">In July 1997 direct talks led to the Madrid Declaration, in which Greece and Turkey pledged not to use vio­lence or the threat of violence to resolve bilateral disputes. Relations between the two countries improved, after Greece offered financial and material assistance to Turkey in August 1999, following a severe earthquake in the north-west of that country. At an EU summit in December, Turkey was granted official candidate status, Greece having formally lifted its veto against Turkish membership. In May 2004 the Turkish Prime Minister, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, made an official visit to Greece (the first by a Turkish premier in 16 years).</p>
                    <p>Co-operation accords with Turkey were signed during a visit to Greece by Erdoğan in May 2010. However, a further bilateral dispute ensued after eight Turkish military officers fled to Greece and demanded political asylum in July 2016, following a coup attempt in Turkey and reprisals by the authorities. In January 2017 a Greek Appeals Court ruled in favour of their asylum claim, resulting in increased bilateral tensions. In December Erdoğan (who had become Turkish President) met his Greek counterpart and Prime Minister Tsipras, in the first official visit to Greece by a Turkish head of state for 65 years; however, his reported remarks during the visit, including demands for the revision of national borders, provoked controversy. In March 2018 two Greek soldiers who had crossed the border into Turkey were detained there on suspicion of espionage, resulting in further bilateral strains. (The soldiers were provisionally released in August.) Tsipras made an official visit to Turkey in February 2019 for discussions on issues of contention.</p>
                    <p>In June 2019 Greece and Cyprus requested that the EU impose punitive measures against Turkey, after a Turkish drilling vessel began operations in waters considered part of Cyprus’s exclusive economic zone. Regional tensions further increased following the signature of an accord on maritime boundaries and military co-operation by Turkey and Libya’s UN-recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) in November, which Greece regarded as an infringement of its own territorial rights. (Greece subsequently expelled the Libyan ambassador.) Ostensibly in response to increasing migrant arrivals (see below), in January 2020 Prime Minister Mitsotakis announced the deployment of an additional 400 border guards at Greece’s land frontier with Turkey and some 800 on its islands. A sharp increase in the reported number of incursions into Greek airspace by Turkish fighter jets followed, and continued throughout 2020-21.</p>
                    <p>On 9 June 2020 Greek Minister of Foreign Affairs Dendias and his visiting Italian counterpart signed an agreement demarcating an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) between the two countries, in accordance with the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Regional tensions increased sharply after Turkey on 21 July announced plans to conduct hydrocarbons exploration activities near the Greek island of Kastellorizo, off the south-western coast of Turkey, prompting a formal protest from Greece. Following intervention by Germany and other EU states in support of Greece, the Turkish Government agreed to suspend the planned survey in the region and committed to dialogue. However, on 6 August Dendias and the foreign minister of Egypt also signed a maritime agreement in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, creating an EEZ for hydrocarbons drilling rights between the two countries (in accordance with the UNCLOS); Dendias’s claim that the agreement nullified the 2019 accord between Turkey and Libya (reached in violation of the UNCLOS) was rejected by Turkey and Libya’s GNA. After Greece also deployed warships to the contested waters, a collision between Greek and Turkish frigates on 12 August further escalated tensions. In response, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) stationed fighter jets at a naval base on the Greek island of Crete, as part of joint military exercises. In November Greece and the UAE signed a mutual defence pact. Meanwhile, despite further German mediation efforts, Turkey resumed activities to conduct exploration near Kastellorizo and again dispatched a research vessel, escorted by Turkish frigates, to the area. Following approval by Parliament, an agreement to purchase 18 fighter jets from France for €2,500m. was finalized during a visit by the French defence minister to Athens on 25 January 2021. Greek and Turkish representatives met in İstanbul, Turkey, on the same day for `exploratory talks’ to address the maritime disputes (the first such meeting since regular discussions had been suspended in 2016). In mid-April 2021 Dendias met his Turkish counterpart in the Turkish capital, Ankara; however, a subsequent televised joint statement by the two ministers became openly acrimonious. Mitsotakis and Erdoğan met in İstanbul in March 2022, and agreed to attempt to foster improved relations; however, relations deteriorated again in May, when Mitsotakis, during a visit to the USA, urged the US Congress not to lift a ban on the sale of fighter aircraft to Turkey. In September Türkiye accused Greece of arming the Aegean islands, in contravention of a commitment to maintain their demilitarized status. In early January 2023 a Turkish naval ship and a Greek coastguard vessel exchanged warning shots near the Greek Aegean island of Farmakonisi. Despite the heightened tensions, Greece dispatched rescue teams and aid supplies after a powerful earthquake struck south-eastern Türkiye in February. A further meeting between Mitsotakis and Erdoğan took place in Athens on 7 December, when the two leaders signed a new declaration of friendship and good neighbourliness.</p>
                    <p id="GR.IS.44">Attempts after 1991 by the FYRM to achieve international recognition as an independent state were strenuously opposed by the Greek Government, which insisted that Macedonia’ was a purely geographical term (delineating an area that included a large part of northern Greece) and expressed fears that the adoption of such a name could imply ambitions on the Greek province of Macedonia. In early 1993 the Greek administration withdrew its former objection to the use of the word `Macedonia’, and its derivatives, as part of a fuller name for the new republic. In March the Greek Government accepted a United Nations (UN) proposal that the title `the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia’ should be used temporarily and agreed to hold direct talks with the FYRM. In September 1995 the foreign ministers of Greece and the FYRM, meeting in New York, USA, under UN auspices, signed an interim accord to normalize relations between the two countries, which included recognition of the existing international border. Negotiations were to be pursued regarding the issue of a permanent name for the FYRM. In March 1997 the Greek Minister of Foreign Affairs visited the FYRM for the first time since its independence.</p>
                    <p>
          Greece strongly objected to the decision by the USA, announced in November 2004, to recognize the FYRM by its constitutional name of `the Republic of Macedonia’. UN-mediated negotiations on the issue continued, while the Greek Government repeatedly threatened to obstruct the FYRM’s hopes of membership of the 
          <xr pageref="Y" ref="NATO.IO">North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)</xr>
           and the EU if it failed to agree to a compromise resolution. At a NATO conference convened in Bucharest, Romania, in April 2008, Greece accordingly vetoed the FYRM’s application for membership. In November the FYRM Government submitted legal proceedings against Greece at the 
          <xr pageref="Y" ref="IO-UN.527">International Court of Justice (ICJ)</xr>
           in The Hague, Netherlands, claiming that it had violated the terms of a UN-mediated interim accord regulating relations between the two countries, which stipulated that Greece would not veto the FYRM's accession to international institutions under that provisional name. On 5 December 2011 the ICJ ruled that Greece had contravened the interim accord. Following an initiative by the newly elected SYRIZA Government for confidence-building measures, in June 2015 Nikos Kotzias became the first Greek Minister of Foreign Affairs in 11 years to visit the FYRM’s capital, Skopje; his FYRM counterpart, Nikola Dimitrov, made a reciprocal visit to Athens in December. During another visit by Kotzias to Skopje in August 2017, he and Dimitrov pledged to resume efforts to resolve the name dispute, which since 2009 had also prevented endorsement of a recommendation by the European Commission that EU accession negotiations be opened with the FYRM. Accordingly, further UN-mediated negotiations were convened in December in Brussels.
        </p>
                    <p>
          Large-scale protest rallies against any compromise agreement on a name that would include the term `Macedonia’ were staged in Thessaloniki in January 2018, and in Athens in February. On 17 June Tsipras and his FYRM counterpart, Zoran Zaev, meeting at Lake Prespa, signed an agreement providing for the FYRM to be renamed as the Republic of North Macedonia, and for Greece to end its opposition to the country’s applications for membership of the EU and NATO. Demonstrations against the proposed name change took place in Athens. Direct commercial flights between Greece and the FYRM resumed in November, after a suspension of 12 years. At a referendum held in the FYRM at the end of September, voters supported EU and NATO membership by accepting the accord, but turnout was insufficient. Nevertheless, the Prespa Agreement was ratified by the Macedonian legislature on 11 January 2019 and, despite continued demonstrations of popular opposition, by the Greek Parliament on 25 January (see 
          <i>Domestic Political Affairs</i>
          ). On 8 February Greece became the first NATO member state to ratify the FYRM’s NATO accession protocol, allowing the name change officially to enter into effect on 12 February.

                    <p>In the mid-2010s the SYRIZA-led Government began to establish closer links with the Russian Federation, and in April 2015 Tsipras met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, Russia. However, in July 2018 the Government announced that two Russian diplomats were to be expelled from Greece, accused of attempting to undermine national security, reportedly in connection with activities intended to encourage Greek rejection of the proposed new constitutional name for the FYRM. The Greek Government condemned Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. In July Russia included Greece on a list of `unfriendly’ countries.</p>
                    <p>From mid-2015 an intensification of conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic contributed to a significant increase in the flow of refugees to Europe: by late December more than 800,000 had reached Greek islands by sea. After the EU warned Greece to improve border control and its reception of migrants, the authorities accepted EU assistance in reinforcing border security. Following negotiations in Athens, on 18 March 2016 an EU agreement was reached with Turkey, according to which migrants crossing into Greek territory were to be held provisionally in island detention camps, and if considered not to be in immediate need of international protection, were to be returned to Turkey. The EU agreement produced an immediate decline in refugee arrivals in Greece; however, poor living conditions in Greek detention camps (which had resulted in accidental deaths) prompted incidents of rioting and hunger strikes.</p>
                    <p>Following a resurgence in migrant arrivals in late 2019, on 31 October the Greek Parliament adopted a new asylum law designed to accelerate procedures for the return of more migrants to Turkey under the 2016 agreement; the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), in addition to human rights groups, strongly criticized the provisions of the new law. In January 2020 the Government announced plans to build 10 new detention facilities for the relocation of some 15,000 migrants from overcrowded camps on the Aegean islands. In addition, it launched a tender for a 2.7-km floating barrier in the Aegean to prevent migrants from arriving by sea. In contravention of the 2016 EU-Turkey agreement, at the end of February 2020 the Turkish Government announced that it would not prevent migrants from crossing its borders into Europe (following an upsurge in fighting in Syria). Greek border guards subsequently repelled large numbers of migrants attempting to cross the border near the north-eastern town of Kastanies. On 3 March senior EU officials, including the European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, visited the Kastanies area; von der Leyen pledged an additional €700m., together with an intervention force supplied by the EU border agency, FRONTEX, to support Greece’s efforts in safeguarding its border. In June 2023 a fishing vessel bound for Italy and carrying up to 750 irregular migrants sank in international waters some 80&#160;km from the Greek coast at Pylos; only 104 of those on board survived, and in mid-June there were nationwide protests at alleged inadequacies in the response of the Greek authorities. The Naval Court of Piraeus, which had jurisdiction over the Coast Guard, opened a preliminary investigation later in June, and in mid-September 40 survivors filed a complaint at the court, alleging the Greek authorities to bear criminal responsibility for the disaster. In addition, the European Ombudsman in July opened an inquiry into the responsibilities of FRONTEX for search and rescue operations. In mid-January 2024 the European Court of Human Rights issued a ruling against Greece for violating the right to life and ordered the country to pay €80,000 in damages, in relation to an incident in 2014 when coastguards fired shots at a migrant boat, causing the death of a Syrian man.</p>

               <p id="GR.IS.58">Energy is derived principally from lignite, which accounted for 42.7% of production in 2015, followed by natural gas (17.5%), hydroelectric power (11.8%) and petroleum (10.9%). However, the Government has pledged to close all 14 of the country’s lignite-fired power stations by 2025, and develop alternative energy sources, in an effort to combat pollution. Greece is exploiting an offshore petroleum deposit in the north-eastern Aegean Sea. Mineral fuels represented 34.9% of the total value of imports in 2022.</p>
               <p id="GR.IS.59">The services sector contributed a provisional 77.7% of GDP in 2023, and engaged 72.8% of the employed labour force in the third quarter of 2023. Tourism is an important source of foreign exchange. The sector was severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with arrivals declining from 31.3m. in 2019 to 7.4m. in 2020. The sector subsequently recovered, however, and in 2022 there were 27.8m. arrivals, while receipts from tourism totalled €17,676.2m.

        In May 2010 the 
        <xr pageref="Y" ref="WB02047.IO.TXT">European Union (EU)</xr>
        , the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Central Bank (ECB) `troika’ agreed a €110,000m. rescue programme for Greece, conditional on the adoption of austerity measures; eurozone countries agreed additional funding totalling €130,000m. for a second bailout plan in March 2012. After the new Government of anti-austerity party Synaspismos Rizospastikis Aristeras (SYRIZA—Coalition of the Radical Left) demanded a renegotiation of the bailout terms, on 30 June 2015 Greece defaulted on a loan repayment to the IMF. In July the Government accepted a new, three-year bailout programme under the EU’s European Stability Mechanism (ESM), according to which Greece would receive up to €86,000m. In June 2018 agreement was reached on debt relief for Greece, extending repayment terms by 10 years: Greece was to receive periodic debt relief aid until mid-2022, while maintaining a primary budget surplus of 3.5% of GDP. The final tranche of ESM financial assistance for Greece was disbursed in August 2018, and Greece exited the bailout programme on 20 August, remaining subject to post-programme monitoring. In March 2019 the Government issued its first 10-year sovereign bond for nine years, raising some €2,500m. After SYRIZA was defeated in legislative elections in July, new Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis presented economic reforms designed to promote private investment and accelerate growth. In January 2020 the Government issued a further, 15-year bond. However, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the tourism sector halted Greece’s incipient economic recovery, and GDP contracted by 9.0% in 2020. Mitsotakis announced economic support measures for the most severely affected citizens and businesses. The country reopened to international tourists from May 2021, and GDP growth of 8.4% was recorded in that year. The European Commission announced the end of its `enhanced surveillance’ of the economy in August 2022, acknowledging that Greece had largely satisfied its policy commitments, despite the 
        
        impact of the pandemic and the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine in February. In 2022 GDP increased by 5.9% overall, generated by continued recovery in the tourism sector. Despite the adverse impact of severe weather-related events during the second half of the year, GDP growth in 2023 remained robust, at 2.5% (more than twice the eurozone average), benefiting from rising investment. The unemployment rate declined in November 2023 to its lowest level since mid-2009, while the public debt-to-GDP ratio was reduced to below its pre-pandemic level. In October credit rating agency S&amp;P Global raised Greece’s rating to investment grade, and in January 2024 Greece raised €4,000m. from the issue of a 10-year bond.
