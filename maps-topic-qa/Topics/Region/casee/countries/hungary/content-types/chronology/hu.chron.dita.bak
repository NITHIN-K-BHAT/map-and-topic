The rate of participation by the electorate was 69.6%. A concurrent referendum asked voters whether they supported teaching on sexual orientation in schools without parental consent, whether minors should have access to information and media content relating to gender reassignment, and whether they should be able to access unrestricted media content on sexuality. Although more than 90% of the participating electorate answered `no’ to all questions, the turnout fell below the 50% threshold required to validate the results.</chron-text>

               <chron-text>A new Government took office, again led by Orbán, and largely retaining ministers from the previous administration; in a notable new appointment, Kristóf Szalay-Bobrovniczky became Minister of Defence. On the same day the legislature approved a constitutional amendment that enabled Orbán to assume emergency powers from 25 May, citing the economic impact of the conflict in Ukraine, following Russia’s large-scale invasion of that country on 24 February and the subsequent adoption of wide-ranging economic sanctions by EU member states (including Hungary, although Orbán had a history of cordial relations with Russia and had delayed the adoption of a sixth set of sanctions, which was finally announced on 3 June).</chron-text>

               <chron-text>The European Commission proposed the suspension of EU cohesion funds allocated to Hungary under the 2021-27 budget, activating the conditionality mechanism linking EU subsidies to respect of the rule of law. Three days earlier a large majority in the European Parliament had supported a symbolic resolution declaring that Hungary was no longer considered a full democracy, but that the country had become a `hybrid regime of electoral autocracy’.</chron-text>
