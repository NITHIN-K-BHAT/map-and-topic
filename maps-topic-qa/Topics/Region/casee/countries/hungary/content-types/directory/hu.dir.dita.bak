                    <p>The Fundamental Law of Hungary, adopted by the Országgyülés (National Assembly) on 25 April 2011, entered into effect on 1 January 2012, replacing the Constitution of 1949, which had been revised on subsequent occasions, most notably in October 1989.</p>
                    <p>The following is a summary of the main provisions of the Fundamental Law.</p>

                         <heading>National Avowal</heading>
                         <p>The document commences with the National Avowal, under the heading `God bless the Hungarians’, which expresses pride at the establishment of the Hungarian State by King St Stephen (István) as part of Christian Europe; professes that the basis of human existence is human dignity; and respects the achievements of Hungary’s historic constitution and Holy Crown, while refusing to acknowledge the suspension of the historic constitution as a result of foreign occupation or the legal continuity of the communist Constitution of 1949. The document states that Hungary’s self-determination was lost on 19 March 1944 and regained on 2 May 1990, which date is considered to be the beginning of the country’s new democracy and constitutional order. The need for spiritual and intellectual renewal after the state of moral decay that was brought about in the 20th century is acknowledged. The Fundamental Law is described as the foundation of the legal system, and as a contract between Hungarians of the past, present and future.</p>
