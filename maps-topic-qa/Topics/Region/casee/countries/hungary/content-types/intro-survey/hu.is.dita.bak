               <p id="HU.IS.3">Hungary lies in Central Europe, bounded to the north by Slovakia, to the east by Ukraine and Romania, to the south by Serbia and Croatia, and to the west by Slovenia and Austria. Its climate is continental, with long, dry summers and severe winters. Temperatures in Budapest are generally between −3°C (27°F) and 28°C (82°F). The language is Hungarian (Magyar). There is a large Romany community (numbering between 500,000 and 700,000 people), and also Croat, German, Romanian, Serb, Slovak, Slovene and Jewish minorities. The largest single religious denomination is the Catholic Church, representing about 69% of those declaring a faith in the 2022 census (however, 56% of the population did not declare a religion). Other Christian groups include Calvinists, Lutherans, Pentecostals and the Eastern Orthodox Church. The national flag (proportions 2 by 3) consists of three equal horizontal stripes, of red, white and green. The capital is Budapest.</p>

                    <heading>Historical Context</heading>
                    <p id="HU.IS.5">Hungary entered the Second World War on the side of Nazi Germany in 1941, and on seeking to break the alliance in 1944 the country was occupied by German forces. In January 1945 Hungary was invaded by Soviet troops and signed an armistice, restoring pre-1938 frontiers. The Magyar Kommunista Párt (Hungarian Communist Party) merged with the Szociáldemokrata Párt (Social Democratic Party) to form the Magyar Dolgozók Pártja (MDP—Hungarian Workers’ Party) in June 1948. A People’s Republic was established in August 1949.</p>
                    <p id="HU.IS.6">As First Secretary of the MDP, Mátyás Rákosi became the leading political figure, and opposition was removed by means of purges and political trials. Rákosi became Prime Minister in 1952; in 1953 he was replaced by the more moderate Imre Nagy; Rákosi remained First Secretary, and in 1955 forced Nagy’s resignation. Following dissension between the Rákosi and Nagy factions, in July 1956 Rákosi resigned, but was replaced by a close associate, Ernő Gerő. Demonstrations against communist domination ensued, and in October fighting broke out. Nagy was reinstated as Prime Minister; he renounced membership of the Warsaw Pact (the defence grouping of the Soviet bloc). In November Soviet troops, stationed in Hungary under the 1947 peace treaty, intervened, and the uprising was suppressed. A new Soviet-supported Government, led by János Kádár, was installed. Some 20,000 participants in the uprising were arrested, of whom 2,000 were subsequently executed, including Nagy and four associates. Kádár, who was appointed the leader of the reconstituted Magyar Szocialista Munkáspárt (MSzMP—Hungarian Socialist Workers’ Party), held the premiership until January 1958, and from September 1961 until July 1965.</p>
                    <p id="HU.IS.8">In March 1985 Kádár was re-elected as leader of the MSzMP. The legislative elections in June were conducted under the system of mandatory multiple nominations. In May 1988 Kádár was succeeded as MSzMP General Secretary of the Central Committee by Károly Grósz (Chairman of the Council of Ministers since June 1987), and appointed to the new, ceremonial post of party President. About one-third of the members of the Central Committee were replaced by younger politicians. In November 1988 Miklós Németh, a prominent member of the MSzMP, replaced Grósz as Chairman of the Council of Ministers.</p>
                    <p id="HU.IS.10">Following Grósz’s appointment as leader of the MSzMP, censorship laws were relaxed. In January 1989 the Országgyülés (National Assembly) enacted legislation guaranteeing the right to demonstrate and to form independent associations and political parties. In February the MSzMP agreed to abandon the constitutional clause upholding the party’s leading role in society. In May the Council of Ministers declared its independence from the MSzMP; Kádár was removed from the presidency and the Central Committee of the party. At a provincial by-election in July, a joint candidate of the centre-right Magyar Demokrata Fórum (MDF—Hungarian Democratic Forum), the liberal Szabad Demokraták Szövetsége (SzDSz—Alliance of Free Democrats) and the Fiatal Demokraták Szövetsége (Fidesz—Federation of Young Democrats) became the first opposition deputy since 1947 to win representation in the legislature. Four further by-elections were won by opposition candidates in July-September 1989. Following continued anti-Government demonstrations, in September the MSzMP and the opposition agreed that the Constitution and electoral law be fundamentally amended. At an MSzMP Congress in October, the party was reconstituted as the Magyar Szocialista Párt (MSzP—Hun­garian Socialist Party).</p>

                    <heading>Domestic Political Affairs</heading>
                    <p id="HU.IS.14">On 18 October 1989 the National Assembly elected parliamentary President (Speaker) Mátyás Szűrös to the newly created post of President of the Republic, on an interim basis. On 23 October (the anniversary of the 1956 uprising) the Republic of Hungary was proclaimed. Multi-party elections were held on 25 March and 8 April 1990. The MDF won 165 of the 386 seats in the National Assembly, followed by the SzDSz, with 92 seats. The Független Kisgazda Párt (FKgP—Independent Smallholders’ Party) and Kereszténydemokrata Néppárt (KDNP—Christian Democratic People’s Party), both of which contested the second round of polling in alliance with the MDF, received 43 and 21 seats, respectively. The MSzP secured 33 seats, while Fidesz obtained 21 seats.</p>
                    <p id="HU.IS.16">A coalition Government was formed in May 1990, comprising members of the MDF, the FKgP and the KDNP, and headed by József Antall, the Chairman of the MDF. In August Árpád Göncz of the SzDSz was elected President of the Republic by the legislature. At local elections in September and October, a coalition of the SzDSz and Fidesz won control of Budapest and many other cities. In May 1991 the National Assembly approved legislation to provide compensation for persons killed, imprisoned or deported, or whose property had been expropriated for political reasons in 1939-89.</p>
                    <p id="HU.IS.19">In February 1992 the Chairman of the FKgP, József Torgyán, frustrated at his party’s perceived lack of political influence, announced that it was to withdraw from the Government. However, many FKgP deputies disagreed with this decision and the party divided. In September some 50,000 people demonstrated in Budapest against extreme nationalists within the MDF, including the Vice-Chairman of the party, István Csurka. Csurka was expelled from the MDF in July 1993, and subsequently founded the Magyar Igazság és Élet Pártja (MIÉP—Hungarian Justice and Life Party). Antall died in December, and was succeeded as Prime Minister by Péter Boross, an independent, and hitherto the Minister of the In­terior.</p>

                         <heading>Democratic Consolidation</heading>
                         <p id="HU.IS.21">Elections to the National Assembly on 8 and 29 May 1994 resulted in a parliamentary majority for the MSzP, with 209 of the 386 seats. The SzDSz obtained 70 seats, and the MDF only 37. The MSzP and the SzDSz signed a coalition agreement in June, and Gyula Horn, leader of the MSzP, was invested as Prime Minister in July. Eco­nomic austerity measures, adopted in March 1995, prompted domestic criticism and ministerial resignations. Following the election of Sándor Lezsák to the MDF leadership, a split in the party ensued in March. On 19 June the National Assembly re-elected Göncz as President of the Republic. In December the MDF established an electoral alliance with the reconstituted Fiatal Demokraták Szövetsége—Magyar Polgári Szövetség (Federation of Young Demo­crats—Hungarian Civic Party, which continued to be known as Fidesz).</p>
                         <p id="HU.IS.31">Elections to the National Assembly took place in May 1998. Fidesz obtained the largest representation, with 147 seats, ahead of the MSzP, with 134. The FKgP won 48 seats, the SzDSz 24, the MDF 18 and the MIÉP 14. In June Fidesz signed a coalition agreement with the MDF and the FKgP (later renamed the Független Kisgazda, Földmunkás és Polgári Párt—Independent Smallholders’, Agrarian Workers’ and Civic Party). In July the National Assembly elected Viktor Orbán, the Chairman of Fidesz, as Prime Minister of a Government dominated by Fidesz representatives. In June 2000 Ferenc Mádl, the sole candidate, was elected President of the Republic, taking office on 4 August.</p>
                         <p id="HU.IS.37">In legislative elections in April 2002, although an alliance of Fidesz and the MDF won 48.7% of the total votes cast (and 188 seats), a coalition of the MSzP (with 46.1% of the votes and 178 seats) and the SzDSz (5.2% of the votes and 20 seats) secured an overall majority in the National Assembly. On 27 May Péter Medgyessy of the MSzP was sworn in as Prime Minister of a left-wing coalition Government. In June media allegations prompted Medgyessy to reveal that he had served as a counter-intelligence agent at the Ministry of Finance in 1977-82. Zoltán Pokorni, the leader of Fidesz since May 2001, who had led demands for Medgyessy’s resignation, relinquished his own party and parliamentary posts in July 2002, after his father’s role as a communist informer was revealed. It subsequently emerged that several members of Fidesz had counter-intelligence associations.</p>
                         <p id="HU.IS.560000">
            In December 2002 the National Assembly adopted constitutional amendments required to permit the country to become a full member of the 
            <xr pageref="Y" ref="WB02047.IO.TXT">European Union (EU)</xr>
            . In May 2003 Fidesz was re-formed as Fidesz—Magyar Polgári Szövetség (Fidesz—Hungarian Civic Alliance), with Orbán as its leader. On 1 May 2004 Hungary acceded to full membership of the EU. On 18 August Medgyessy resigned as Prime Minister following a dispute with the SzDSz over proposed changes to the Council of Ministers. Following his nomination by the MSzP, on 4 October one of the country’s wealthiest business executives, Ferenc Gyurcsány, hitherto Minister of Children, Youth and Sports, was installed as Prime Minister. On 7 June 2005 László Sólyom, an independent politician endorsed by the main opposition parties, was elected as Presi­dent, taking office on 5 August.
          </p>
                         <p>At legislative elections on 9 and 23 April 2006 the governing MSzP-SzDSz coalition secured 210 of the 386 seats in the National Assembly and 54.4% of the votes. A coalition of Fidesz and the KDNP, with 42.5% of the votes, secured 164 seats, the MDF took 11 seats (with 2.9% of the votes) and one seat was won by an independent candidate. In early June a new Government, led by Gyurcsány and comprising members of the MSzP and the SzDSz, was formed.</p>
                         <p>On 17 September 2006 the media broadcast of a clandestine recording of a post-election speech by Gyurcsány to party members, in which he admitted having intentionally misled the electorate during the campaign, precipitated mass anti-Government protests in Budapest. Protesters surrounded government buildings and temporarily seized control of the state television headquarters; some 300 people were injured. On 27 September Gyurcsány issued an apology for the Government’s delay in addressing the economic situation. At municipal elections on 2 October, Fidesz made significant gains, securing majorities in 18 of the 19 county assemblies. Nevertheless, in early October a parliamentary motion of confidence in the Government was supported by 207 votes in the National Assembly. Official celebrations on 23 October, the 50th anniversary of the 1956 uprising against Soviet rule, were marred by anti-Government demonstrations, organized by the leadership of&#160;Fidesz, which demanded Gyurcsány’s resignation. Security forces suppressed riots, in which about 170 people were injured. In February 2007 a commission investigating the rioting issued a report critical of Fidesz’s implied support for the protesters, predominantly associated with extreme nationalist groups, while concluding that the police had employed excessive force.</p>
                         <p>At the end of March 2008 Gyurcsány dismissed the Minister of Health, an SzDSz representative, prompting the party to withdraw from the governing coalition (which henceforth lacked a parliamentary majority). An extensive government reorganization was approved in the National Assembly in May. Financial crisis in Hungary exacerbated anti-Government sentiment. In March 2009 Gyurcsány announced his intention to resign as Prime Minister, and relinquished the party leadership. Gordon Bajnai, an independent candidate nominated by the MSzP, was elected Prime Minister by the National Assembly on 14 April, and subsequently formed a new Council of Ministers. Fidesz boycotted the parliamentary vote, and a demonstration was staged in Budapest to demand early legislative elections.</p>

                         <heading>Constitutional Changes</heading>
                         <p>At elections to the European Parliament on 7 June 2009 Fidesz, in coalition with the KDNP, secured 14 of the 22 contested seats, the MSzP four seats, an extreme nationalist movement, Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom (Jobbik—Movement for a Better Hungary), three seats, and the MDF one seat; the rate of electoral participation was 36.3%.</p>
                         <p>In elections to the National Assembly on 11 and 25 April 2010 Fidesz, again in coalition with the KDNP, won 263 of the 386 elective seats (narrowly securing the two-thirds of seats required to adopt constitutional amendments). The MSzP was the second-placed party, with 59 seats, followed by Jobbik (which obtained national representation for the first time), with 47 seats; a new environmentalist party, Lehet Más a Politika! (LMP—Politics Can Be Different!), obtained 16 seats. The National Assembly approved a new Government, with Orbán as Prime Minister, on 29 May. On 29 June the National Assembly elected Pál Schmitt of Fidesz (parliamentary Chairman since May) as President of the Republic; Schmitt assumed office on 6 August. In local government elections on 3 October, Fidesz secured 22 of the 23 mayoralties, including that of Budapest, and majorities in all 19 county assemblies. Gyurcsány subsequently announced the establishment of a group, known as the Demokratikus Koalíció (DK—Democratic Coalition), within the MSzP, following the latter’s defeat. (The DK later broke away from the MSzP to become an independent political organization.)</p>
                         <p>In November 2010 the National Assembly adopted legislation restricting the powers of the Constitutional Court to rule on the state budget, taxes and other financial matters. In December new media legislation, whereby a regulatory authority, to be nominated by the ruling coalition, was empowered to impose large fines on outlets for violating `public interest, public morals or order’, prompted a protest in Budapest. The European Commission pronounced the legislation, which entered into effect at the beginning of 2011, to be in violation of EU regulations on freedom of expression. In December the Constitutional Court vetoed parts of the media legislation.</p>
                         <p>A draft Constitution, which renamed the country `Hungary’, rather than the `Republic of Hungary’, was approved by the National Assembly on 18 April 2011, and signed into law by Schmitt on 25 April. In December legislation was approved to reduce the number of members of the National Assembly from 386 to 199, adopt a new parliamentary election system and introduce voting rights for Hungarian citizens not permanently resident in Hungary. The new Constitution entered into force on 1 January 2012, amid large protests in Budapest. The European Commission later that month launched accelerated infringement proceedings against Hungary, citing political interference in the judiciary, the central bank and data protection laws, and in March announced the suspension of funding commitments.</p>
                         <p>On 2 April 2012 Schmitt resigned as President, following allegations of plagiarism surrounding his doctoral thesis. Orbán nominated János Áder, a senior member of Fidesz and former President of the National Assembly, as a presidential candidate. On 2 May Áder was duly elected by the National Assembly as the new President.</p>
                         <p>In September 2012 Gyurcsány and two other members of the DK staged a one-week hunger strike outside the parliamentary building, in protest against a proposed change to the electoral law that would require voters to register at least 15 days before an election. In October the new electoral law was adopted by the National Assembly; however, it was subsequently referred by President Áder to the Constitutional Court. A large, pro-Government rally was staged on 23 October, while at a concurrent opposition demonstration Bajnai announced the creation of a new, centrist alliance, Együtt 2014 (Together 2014). In January 2013 the Constitutional Court ruled against the new voter registration regulations, together with proposed restrictions on political advertising.</p>
                         <p>
            Meanwhile, radical constitutional changes proposed by the Government prompted mass protests in Budapest, in addition to criticism by the EU and the USA. Under the proposals, rulings made by the Constitutional Court prior to 2012, as well as those relating to the restrictions on political advertisements, were to be overturned and its future powers limited. The amendments were approved in the National Assembly on 11 March 2013. In response to EU pressure, however, in September the National Assembly adopted further amendments that, 
            <i>inter alia</i>
            , permitted election campaigning by political parties in both state-funded and private media.

                         <p>In January 2014 several leftist opposition parties, including the MSzP, Bajnai’s Együtt 2014 and Gyurcsány’s DK, signed an agreement to establish a coalition, Összefogás (Unity), to contest forthcoming legislative elections. The elections on 6 April were the first to be conducted under the 2012 Constitution: Orbán’s Fidesz and the KDNP, in coalition, won 133 seats in the smaller, 199-member National Assembly (narrowly retaining a two-thirds’ majority). Unity secured 38 seats, Jobbik obtained 23 seats and the LMP won five seats. A rate of voter participation of 61.7% was recorded.</p>
                         <p>At elections to the European Parliament on 25 May 2014, the Fidesz-KDNP alliance secured 51.5% of the votes cast and 12 of the 21 seats allocated to Hungary. Jobbik was placed second, with 14.7% of the votes and three seats, followed by the MSzP, with 10.9% and two seats, and the DK, with 9.8% and two seats. Two groups each received one seat: an alliance led by Együtt 2014, Párbeszéd Magyarországért (PM—Dialogue For Hungary), which received 7.3% of the votes cast; and the LMP, with 5.0%. The rate of participation was 28.9%.</p>
                         <p>The resignation of a Fidesz parliamentary deputy to become an EU commissioner resulted in a by-election in the western town of Veszprém on 22 February 2015, which was won by Zoltán Kész, an independent. Kész’s victory ended the Fidesz-led alliance’s two-thirds’ parliamentary majority. At another by-election in April, Jobbik won its first single-member constituency mandate in the National Assembly.</p>
                         <p>
            In June 2015 the authorities launched an anti-migrant campaign, which was strongly opposed by left-wing groups. Despite criticism from the United Nations (UN) and the Council of Europe, on 6 July the National Assembly adopted legislation that increased restrictions on asylum claims. Following a large increase in refugee arrivals, on 16 November the National Assembly approved legislation obliging the Government to challenge an EU plan for mandatory refugee allocation quotas, on the grounds that the quota system would increase crime and terrorism (see 
            <i>Regional Relations</i>
            ). Orbán announced in February 2016 that a referendum would be held on the planned EU system of mandatory refugee quotas. The Constitutional Court rejected appeals against the planned referendum, which Áder scheduled for 2 October. At the referendum, 98.4% of the votes supported the Government’s view that the EU should not be able to impose mandatory quotas for the resettlement of non-Hungarians in the absence of approval by the National Assembly; however, the results were not legally binding due to the participation rate, which was only 44.0% of the electorate (after the main opposition parties urged a boycott). Draft legislation intended to make the outcome binding was defeated in the National Assembly in early November, after Jobbik (although strenuously anti-immigration) withheld its support, owing to Orbán’s refusal to abandon a scheme that allowed foreign nationals to purchase special state bonds in exchange for residency rights.

                         <p>In January 2017 Fidesz announced plans to ban the activities of the Open Society Foundation, owned by the Hungarian-born businessman George Soros (believed to finance some 60 Hungarian non-governmental organizations—NGOs). In the same month the Government declared its intention to introduce the indefinite detention of all migrants pending a decision on their asylum application; despite further criticism from human rights bodies, legislation providing for the measure was approved in the National Assembly on 7 March.</p>

            On 13 March 2017 a presidential election was held in the National Assembly. Since neither Áder nor the opposition candidate, former parliamentary ombudsman László Majtényi, secured the necessary two-thirds’ majority, the two candidates proceeded to a second round on the same day, which required a simple majority; Áder was re-elected for a second term, receiving 131 votes.
          </p>
                         <p>On 4 April 2017 the National Assembly adopted amendments to higher education legislation imposing conditions on the operation of foreign universities in Hungary, which were believed to target the Central European University, established and partially funded by Soros. The new law prompted immediate protests in Budapest. In mid-June the National Assembly adopted legislation requiring NGOs receiving more than €24,000 annually in overseas funding to register as `foreign-supported’ and to disclose their donors. A series of measures, the `Stop Soros’ laws, were announced by the Government in January 2018; they were to empower the Ministry of the Interior to ban NGOs that were considered to represent a security risk or to be supportive of immigration, or to impose a 25% tax on foreign funding to those supporting immigration.</p>
                         <p>
            In legislative elections on 8 April 2018, Fidesz obtained 133 of the 199 seats in the National Assembly, securing a large majority, and a third term in office for Orbán. Jobbik won 26 seats, while an alliance of the MSzP and the PM secured 20, the DK nine and the LMP eight. The rate of participation was recorded at 70.2%. An

             monitoring mission criticized the conduct of the electoral campaign, citing xenophobic rhetoric, media bias and non-transparent campaign financing as having undermined democratic conditions. A demonstration against the re-election of Orbán’s Government, attended by an estimated 100,000 people, took place in Budapest on 14 April 2018, and a further mass protest followed one week later. The new Government, in which many senior ministers retained their posts, took office on 18 May.

                         <p>On 20 June 2018 the National Assembly approved the Stop Soros laws, additionally making it a criminal offence to provide assistance to those seeking asylum or residency in Hungary, despite an appeal by the Council of Europe’s Venice Commission to postpone approval until it had published an assessment of the proposals. Later that year the European office of Soros’s Open Society Foundations was relocated from Budapest to Berlin, Germany, and the Central European University to Vienna, Austria.</p>

            On 12 December 2018 Hungary adopted legislation providing for the establishment of new administrative courts to be overseen by the Minister of Justice, which would have significant powers in appointing their judges and controlling their budgets, despite strenuous opposition on the grounds that the legislation would further undermine the rule of law. On the same day the National Assembly adopted labour laws that allowed employers to request significantly increased amounts of overtime and to delay payment for it. Demonstrations against both the new labour laws and the judicial legislation continued in Budapest during January 2019. In February a state advertising campaign was launched prior to European Parliament elections, with billboards featuring European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Soros which accused the EU of endangering national security through its migration policies. The main centre-right group in the European Parliament, the European People’s Party (EPP), threatened to expel Fidesz; Orbán issued a formal apology to the EPP, after remarks made by him about its members were reported in the media. On 20 March the EPP voted to suspend the membership of Fidesz, pending a report by a monitoring group on Fidesz’s compliance with the EPP’s democratic standards. In February 2020 the EPP confirmed that Fidesz’s suspension, owing to concerns about democratic freedom and rule of law, would continue indefinitely. In early March 2021 Fidesz left the EPP parliamentary group, following a vote within the EPP that facilitated excluding parties, and on 18 March it was announced that Fidesz had also left the EPP.
            <!--To clarify, there is a distinction between the parliamentary group of the EPP and the EPP itself. Fidesz has now left both. NG March 2021-->

                         <p>In the elections to the European Parliament on 26 May 2019, the Fidesz-KDNP alliance won 13 of the 21 seats allocated to Hungary, securing 52.1% of the votes cast. The DK was second, obtaining four seats and 16.3% of the votes, ahead of the liberal Momentum Mozgalom (Momentum Movement), with two seats and 9.9%. Jobbik and a coalition of the MSzP and the PM each obtained one seat. The rate of participation, at 43.4% of the electorate, was the highest ever recorded in such elections in Hungary.</p>
                         <p>In local elections on 13 October 2019, opposition or opposition-supported candidates secured the mayoralties in 10 of the 23 major cities (compared with only three previously), including in Budapest, where Gergely Karácsony, the candidate of a wide-ranging opposition bloc, was elected Mayor, defeating the pro-Government incumbent. Nevertheless, the Fidesz-KDNP alliance retained control of all 19 county assemblies.</p>

                         <p>
            In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, on 11 March 2020 the Government imposed a state of emergency, and the country’s borders were closed. On 27 March curfew restrictions were introduced, and a national lockdown imposed. Meanwhile, the Government proposed legislation that would authorize it to rule by decree for an unlimited period by indefinite extension of the state of emergency, while effectively suspending the role of the National Assembly, and the organization of elections and referendums, and introducing prison terms of up to five years for the dissemination of false information considered to impede the effectiveness of measures against COVID-19. The Council of Europe and civil rights groups expressed concerns over the measures. Nevertheless, the emergency legislation was approved by 137 votes cast in the National Assembly on 30 March. 
            <!--https://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-replaces-rule-by-decree-controversial-state-of-medical-crisis/ https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/PETI-CM-696627_EN.pdf-->
            Following a vote in the National Assembly, the state of emergency was officially ended and the authorizing legislation repealed on 18 June; however, it was replaced by a transitional `state of medical crisis’, permitting continued governance by decree for a three month period. (Further states of emergency were declared and subsequently extended.)
          </p>
                         <p>In early October 2020 President Áder nominated András Szolt Varga as President of the Supreme Court. Varga’s candidacy was rejected by the National Judicial Council, but in mid-October the National Assembly approved his appointment. In mid-December the National Assembly passed a law limiting the right to adopt to married couples, with few exceptions, and amending the Constitution to define the concept of the family as taking place solely within a heterosexual context. In the same month, six opposition parties in Hungary—the DK, Jobbik, LMP, Momentum Mozgalom, MSzP and PM—agreed to contest the 2022 parliamentary elections in alliance, as Egységben Magyarországért (United for Hungary).</p>
                         <p>In February 2021 the Government began using the Sputnik V vaccine, developed in the Russian Federation, to inoculate against COVID-19, after it received emergency approval from the country’s regulator. Three further vaccines from outside the EU’s common procurement programme were also approved by Hungary (two of which were developed in the People’s Republic of China and one in India).</p>
                         <p>Meanwhile, concerns about media freedom intensified. In February 2021 Klubrádió, an independent Budapest-based radio station, ceased broadcasts, after losing a legal appeal against a decision by the media regulator not to renew its licence, citing regulatory infringements. In June the European Commission began an infringement procedure against Hungary in relation to the decision not to grant a licence to Klubrádió.</p>
                         <p>In June 2021 the National Assembly passed a law, which came into force on 7 July, prohibiting depictions of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people in educational materials and television programmes designed for those aged under 18 years. After the European Commission in mid-July initiated further infringement procedures against Hungary in relation to the protection of fundamental rights and equality, Orbán announced that a referendum would be held on the new legislation. At the end of November the National Assembly approved the decision to hold the referendum, which was to take place alongside the forthcoming legislative elections.</p>
                         <p>On 21 December 2021 Orbán announced Katalin Novák as Fidesz’s candidate for the forthcoming presidential election, President Áder being ineligible to stand for re-election. On 10 March Novák was elected as President, securing 137 of the votes cast in the National Assembly, while the opposition candidate, Péter Róna, received 51 votes.</p>

                         <heading>Recent Developments: The 2022 Legislative Elections</heading>
                         <p>The legislative elections took place on 3 April 2022. The Fidesz-KDNP alliance secured 135 of the 199 seats in the National Assembly, while the Egységben Magyarországért opposition coalition received 57 seats. A far-right party, Mi Hazánk Mozgalom (Our Homeland Movement), won six seats, and the Magyarországi Németek Országos Önkormányzata (National Authority of Germans), representing the German minority, received one seat. Turnout was reported at 69.6%. An OSCE monitoring mission criticized the electoral conditions, citing in particular media bias and campaign finance regulations in favour of the ruling coalition. At the concurrent referendum, voters were asked whether teaching on sexual orientation should be available in public education institutions, and whether minors should have access to information or media content relating to gender reassignment, and to unrestricted media content on sexuality. Although those participating overwhelmingly answered `no’ to the referendum questions, the share of votes was below the 50% of the registered electorate required to make the result valid; nevertheless, the law remained in force.</p>
                         <p>A new Government, again led by Orbán, and largely retaining ministers from the previous administration, took office on 24 May 2022; Kristóf Szalay-Bobrovniczky became Minister of Defence. On the same day the legislature approved a constitutional amendment that enabled Orbán to assume emergency powers, citing the impact of the war in Ukraine following Russia’s invasion on 24 February. The new `state of danger’ effectively prolonged the pandemic state of emergency that was due to expire at the end of May, allowing Orbán to continue to rule by decree and restricting parliamentary oversight.</p>
                         <p>
            Amid increasing economic difficulties, on 12 July 2022 the National Assembly adopted amendments to tax regulations for small businesses, prompting large protests in Budapest. In mid-July the European Commission decided to refer Hungary to the ECJ over the law on sexuality and the refusal to renew the license of Klubrádió, as the next stage of the infringement procedures launched one year earlier. On 3 October the National Assembly approved the first of a series of planned reforms to the criminal code in an effort to avert the suspension of EU funding by improving the rule of law (see 
            <i>Regional Relations</i>
            ). On the following day the National Assembly approved legislation establishing an anti-corruption Integrity Authority to monitor the distribution of EU subsidies. Meanwhile, from early October large anti-Government protests were staged by students, teachers and other citizens to demand higher salaries and improved conditions for teachers. After the Government had introduced a `minimum level of service’ condition for teachers restricting strike action, a number of teachers were dismissed for civil disobedience, prompting solidarity protests and mass strikes by teachers during December and January 2023. Later that month government ministers announced that legislation would be amended to bar active politicians from holding seats on university boards, following an agreement with the EU on securing the restoration of funding for universities under the Erasmus exchange student programme.
          </p>
                         <p>
            In May 2023 the National Assembly approved organizational reforms for the judiciary, which, 
            <i>inter alia</i>
            , strengthened the status of the National Judicial Council. In late June Minister of Justice Judit Varga announced her resignation from the Government in order to focus on the campaign for the June 2024 European Parliament elections, after it was revealed that Fidesz would nominate her to head the candidate list. She was succeeded by Bence Tuzson. Draft legislation on `protecting national sovereignty’ was presented by Fidesz in November and approved by the National Assembly on 12 December; it restricted funding of opposition parties and provided for the creation of a Sovereignty Protection Office (SPO), which would monitor NGOs and be able to launch investigations against those suspected of `serving foreign interests’. In mid-December representatives of 10 independent media outlets published a letter condemning the new legislation and protesting that the authorities regularly accused the independent media of serving foreign interests. The SPO officially began operations on 1 February 2024. On 7 February the European Commission launched a further infringement procedure against Hungary, stating that the sovereignty legislation violated EU law.
          </p>
                         <p>Meanwhile, in early February 2024 a local online news site reported that President Novák had the previous April granted a pardon to a prisoner who had been convicted as an accomplice to sexual abuse in a children’s home, causing a public outcry and demands for her resignation. On 8 February Orbán submitted a constitutional amendment to the National Assembly that would remove the presidential right to pardon crimes committed against children, and on the following day around 1,000 protesters rallied at the presidential office. Novák (who had been considered a close ally of Orbán) announced her resignation on state television on 10 February, while former Minister of Justice Varga, who had endorsed the pardon, also resigned as a Fidesz parliamentary deputy. Zoltán Balog resigned as President of the General Synod of the Reformed Church in Hungary on 16 February, after apologizing for having supported the presidential pardon. Nevertheless, later that day a mass demonstration, organized by civil groups and attended by around 50,000, was staged in Budapest to demand reforms to the country’s child protection system and to general governance, after which Orbán announced planned measures to improve regulations.</p>
                         <p>On 26 February 2024 Tamás Sulyok, hitherto the President of the Constitutional Court, who had been nominated by the Fidesz-KDNP alliance, was elected by the National Assembly to replace Novák as President of the Republic, with 134 votes in favour and five against. He was inaugurated on 5 March.</p>

            In July 1993 the National Assembly adopted legislation guaran­teeing the cultural, civil and political rights of 12 minority groups and prohibiting ethnic discrimination. From 1994 ethnic minorities were able to elect their own local ethnic authorities, with consultative roles on cultural and educational issues. In February 1995 Hungary signed the 
            <xr pageref="Y" ref="CE.IO">Council of Europe</xr>
             Convention on the Protection of National Minorities. In April the Roma of Hungary elected a new governing body, the National Autonomous Authority of the Romany Minority, which was empowered to administer funds and deliberate issues affecting the Roma.

            In March 2010 legislation that criminalized the denial or `questioning’ of the Holocaust (
            <i>shoah</i>
            ) of the Jews during the Second World War was signed into law in Hungary. However, in May 2013 the annual World Jewish Congress, usually held in Jerusalem, Israel, was convened in Budapest to demonstrate concerns at anti-Semitism in the country. Prime Minister Orbán’s campaigning and actions against George Soros (see 
            <i>Domestic Political Affairs</i>
            ) were a further source of concern among Hungary’s Jewish community, while in late 2018 the negative depiction of the Chairman of the Federation of Jewish Communities in Hungary on the cover of pro-Government business periodical 
            <i>Figyelő</i>
             (Observer), which also accused him of financial malpractice, prompted strong criticism both from the Jewish community and the Israeli Government.

                         <p id="HU.IS.40">A principal factor governing Hungary’s relations with some neighbouring states—particularly Romania and Slovakia—has been the presence in those countries of a substantial population of ethnic Hungarians. In September 1996 Hungary and Romania signed a bilateral treaty, guaranteeing the inviolability of the joint border between the two countries and the rights of minority ethnic groups. In June 2001 the Hungarian National Assembly approved legislation that granted ethnic Hungarians living in adjacent countries education, employment and medical rights in Hungary. This `status’ law prompted protests from Romania (and Slovakia—see below), on the grounds that it constituted a violation of sovereignty. Finally, in September 2003 a bilateral agreement on the implementation of the `status’ law in Romania was signed in Bucharest, Romania.</p>
                         <p id="HU.IS.42">Hungary is a member, with the Czech Republic (Czechia), Slovakia and Poland, of the Visegrad Group (established, following the collapse of communist rule, to promote co-operation in the region). In March 1995 Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula Horn and his Slovak counterpart signed a Treaty of Friendship and Co-operation, according to which the two countries undertook to guarantee the rights of minority ethnic groups and to recognize the inviolability of their common border. A bilateral agreement was signed by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Hungary and Slovakia in December 2003 on the implementation of the Hungarian `status’ law in Slovakia.</p>
                         <p>In May 2010 the National Assembly approved legislation, regarded as an extension of the `status’ law, which would permit ethnic Hungarians resident outside the country to apply for Hungarian citizenship. It was also provided for ethnic Hungarians residing permanently in neighbouring states, with Hungarian as their first language, to remain eligible for benefits, regardless of whether they held Hungarian citizenship. In March 2014 premiers Orbán and Fico inaugurated an EU-financed Hungarian-Slovak natural gas interconnector pipeline, which linked the two countries’ gas networks.</p>
                         <p id="HU.IS.46">In December 2002 Hungary was one of 10 countries formally invited to join the EU in May 2004. At a national referendum on 12 April 2003 Hungarian membership of the EU was endorsed by 83.8% of the votes cast (with 45.6% of the electorate participating). In December 2007 Hungary implemented the EU’s Schengen Agreement, removing border controls for its citizens.</p>
                         <p>
            Despite measures adopted by the Hungarian Government to deter migrants in mid-2015 (see 
            <i>Domestic Political Affairs</i>
            ), record numbers of refugee arrivals precipitated a regional crisis later that year. In an effort to prevent migrant inflows, the Hungarian Government effectively closed its frontier with Serbia in mid-September and its border with Croatia in mid-October, with the erection of fences. The construction of a second, 155-km fence along the border with Serbia was completed in April 2017. In September the European Court of Justice (ECJ) dismissed a legal challenge brought by Hungary and Slovakia against an EU scheme for mandatory refugee allocation quotas. On 7 December the European Commission formally referred the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland to the ECJ for non-compliance with the EU’s emergency relocation scheme; action was also brought against Hungary over its newly adopted higher education law and restrictions on NGOs, after the Government had failed to comply with deadlines issued by the Commission to amend the measures. On 12 September 2018 the European Parliament adopted a censure motion against Hungary for breaches of EU democratic values (the first time that the Parliament had urged the Council of the European Union to take action against an EU member state), which also provided for the imposition of punitive measures under Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union. However, the Polish Government confirmed that it would oppose the introduction of sanctions against Hungary.
          </p>
                         <p>
            In July 2019 the European Commission further referred Hungary to the ECJ over the `Stop Soros’ laws (see 
            <i>Domestic Political Affairs</i>
            ) restricting the right to request asylum and making the provision of assistance to asylum seekers a criminal offence. In October the ECJ’s Advocate-General issued a non-binding opinion that the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland had violated the law by refusing to comply with the EU’s relocation scheme. On 14 January 2020 the ECJ’s Advocate-General issued a further opinion that the restrictions imposed by Hungary on the financing of NGOs from abroad breached EU regulations. Shortly afterwards, the European Parliament adopted a resolution to take action against Poland and Hungary for breaching EU rules and values under the Article 7 procedure. In June the ECJ ruled that the law on foreign financing of NGOs was in breach of provisions in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
          </p>
                         <p>On 17 December 2020 the ECJ issued a ruling that areas of Hungary’s asylum legislation breached EU law, in particular with respect to the practice of detaining asylum seekers in transit zones and forbidding them to remain in Hungary while their claims for asylum were being processed. In November 2021 the ECJ further ruled that a Hungarian law disallowing asylum claims if the potential claimant arrived via a `safe’ country was in conflict with Hungary’s obligations under EU law, as was the law criminalizing assistance to asylum seekers. In December, in response to a case brought by the Government regarding the ECJ’s December 2020 ruling, Hungary’s Constitutional Court ruled that Hungary had the right to introduce its own laws in areas where the EU had yet to ensure the full implementation of Union rules.</p>
                         <p>In November 2020 Hungary and Poland vetoed the adoption of the EU’s new long-term budget, incorporating post-pandemic recovery funds, owing to objections to a new mechanism that would link the disbursement of EU funds to the observance of rule of law criteria by member states. Following intensive negotiations, an agreement was reached on 10 December, under which Hungary and Poland agreed to withdraw their vetoes, with implementation of the mechanism to be deferred until the ECJ had ruled on its legality (after which it would apply retroactively from 1 January 2021). A legal challenge brought by Hungary and Poland against the proposed new mechanism was dismissed by the ECJ in mid-February 2022.</p>
                         <p>The European Commission on 18 September 2022 proposed the suspension of EU cohesion funds allocated to Hungary under the 2021-27 budget, in an unprecedented use of the conditionality mechanism linking EU subsidies to respect of the rule of law, requiring measures to remedy related issues, as well as to increase the transparency and effectiveness of the distribution of EU subsidies. In October the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe voted to place Hungary under its full monitoring procedure. The European Parliament adopted a resolution on 24 November urging the European Commission and member states to continue to freeze funds to Hungary. Meanwhile, Hungary, in reprisal, vetoed the approval of an EU €18,000m. aid package for Ukraine, having also impeded adoption of a minimum global tax rate for corporations. On 12 December an agreement was reached with the EU, under which Hungary would lift its vetoes, while the value of the funding suspended under the conditionality mechanism was to be lowered from some €7,500m. to €6,300m. (Following further delays caused by opposition from Poland, the Ukrainian aid and minimum tax rate were approved on 15 December.) Later that month the European Commission approved Hungary’s Partnership Agreement, which outlined Hungary’s entitlement to around €21,700m. in cohesion funds until 2027, but suspended the release of funds pending the fulfilment of reforms by Hungary.</p>
                         <p>
            The European Commission on 13 December 2023 permitted the release of €10,200m. in EU cohesion funds for Hungary, considering that it had met commitments on judicial independence (following the judicial reforms of May—see 
            <i>Domestic Political Affairs</i>
            ); the decision was announced one day before an EU summit was convened in Brussels, Belgium, to discuss the approval of new aid to Ukraine and the formal opening of the country’s accession negotiations. Although Orbán continued to strenuously oppose both plans, he withdrew from the session prior to the vote on the opening of Ukraine’s EU accession talks, which was consequently approved by all member states present. Following further negotiations between EU leaders, at a further EU summit on 1 February 2024 Hungary also ended its veto on a four-year, €50,000m. financial support package for Ukraine, allowing its adoption. 
            <!--https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2023/12/13/brussels-releases-10-billion-in-frozen-eu-funds-for-hungary-amid-orbans-threats-->
            Some €11,500m. in cohesion funds (including the €6.300m. frozen under the conditionality mechanism) remained suspended, pending progress regarding conditions for awarding public contracts, protecting academic freedom, and ensuring LGBT rights and the right of migrants to claim asylum. Hungary was scheduled to hold the presidency of the Council of the EU during the second half of 2024 (despite a non-binding resolution adopted by the European Parliament in May 2023 opposing Hungary’s presidency).

             summit meeting in July 1997, Hungary was invited to enter into discussions regarding its application for membership of the Alliance. Hungary was formally admitted to NATO in March 1999. In early 2003 an air base at Taszar, in south-western Hungary, was used by the USA in relation to the US-led military campaign in Iraq. Hungary subsequently contributed 300 soldiers to the international peacekeeping force in Iraq. Following considerable public and political opposition, these were withdrawn in March 2005.

                         <p>In November 2012 the Hungarian Government finalized an investment agreement with Russian gas producer Gazprom on the Hungarian section of Russia’s `South Stream’ pipeline project. Following discussions between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Orbán in January 2014, it was announced that a subsidiary of Russian nuclear agency Rosatom had secured a contract to construct a further two units at the nuclear power installation at Paks, in central Hungary, with the Russian Government providing 80% of the project’s costs. Following Russia’s annexation of the Crimean peninsula in March, and subsequent Russian involvement in conflict in eastern Ukraine (see Ukraine), the Hungarian Government complied with sanctions imposed by the EU against Russia, but was highly critical of their regional impact. The Hungarian Government reacted with consternation to an announcement by Putin in December that the South Stream project had been abandoned. In February 2015, however, Putin made an official visit to Hungary, when it was agreed that the gas supply contract between the two countries would be renewed. At a further meeting between Orbán and Putin in February 2016 the gas supply agreement was accordingly extended. A new, long-term agreement on gas supplies was signed with Russia in September 2021.</p>
                         <p>Meanwhile, in October 2015 NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg announced that a new command centre was to be installed in Hungary, to complement six existing command centres in Eastern Europe and potentially to co-ordinate rapid deployment forces against a military threat. The NATO Force Integration Unit, which was to operate with an international staff of 43, was inaugurated in Székesfehérvár, in western Hungary, in November 2016.</p>
                         <p>
            In early March 2022, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, Orbán signed a decree authorizing the deployment of NATO troops in western Hungary and the transit of armaments shipments through Hungarian territory to other NATO member states. 
            <!--https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/2022/11/pdf/221128-factsheet-efp_en.pdf-->
            A new NATO battlegroup was subsequently established, under Hungarian leadership, in the north-western town of Tata; it numbered a total of 1,054 personnel at November, also comprising troops from Italy, Croatia, the USA and later Türkiye. However, the Government subsequently maintained a policy of refusing to supply armaments to Ukraine and to allow the direct transport of weapons to Ukraine from its territory. The Hungarian Government repeatedly criticized the EU’s imposition of wide-ranging economic sanctions against Russia, and delayed the approval of some measures, particularly opposing a ban on Russian crude oil imports as part of a sixth package of sanctions. In a compromise agreement at the end of May, Hungary, together with the Czech Republic and Slovakia, was granted a temporary exemption for Russian oil delivered by pipeline, and the sanctions were officially adopted in June. In August the Hungarian Nuclear Energy Authority granted licences for Rosatom to construct the two new reactors at the Paks nuclear power plant. Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Péter Szijjártó visited the Russian capital, Moscow, in July and again in October (drawing EU criticism) to ensure energy supplies for Hungary. Hungary continued to reject a demand by Ukraine that Rosatom be included in further restrictions, and Orbán declared that Hungary would veto any proposed sanctions on Russia’s nuclear energy industry. In April 2023 Szijjártó signed new energy agreements in Moscow, including one with Gazprom providing for an increase in Russian natural gas imports. In August a subsidiary of Rosatom began main construction work on the two new power units at the Paks power plant, while in September French state-owned nuclear reactor business Framatome signed a memorandum of understanding with the Hungarian Government to expand nuclear co-operation, including Framatome’s participation in the Paks project. According to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, by the end of January 2024 around 4.2m. refugees from Ukraine had crossed the border with Hungary since the Russian invasion; 66,137 Ukrainians had registered in the country as refugees.

                         <p>Meanwhile, following repeated postponements, Hungary’s National Assembly on 27 March 2023 ratified an application by Finland for NATO membership, but continued to delay approval of a concurrent application by Sweden, with Fidesz officials citing past criticism of the Hungarian Government by Swedish political leaders. However, on 26 February 2024 the National Assembly finally adopted a resolution also ratifying Sweden’s accession to NATO, shortly after Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson had visited Budapest and signed a defence industry agreement allowing Hungary’s purchase of four new Swedish-manufactured jet aircraft.</p>
                         <p>An economic summit between the People’s Republic of China and 16 central and eastern European countries was convened in Budapest in November 2017, when the launch of several investment projects, including a high-speed rail link between Budapest and the Serbian capital, Belgrade, was announced. In April 2019 Prime Minister Orbán visited the Chinese capital, Beijing, to attend a forum on China’s Belt and Road Initiative (an ambitious project to develop infrastructure and trade links across Asia, Europe and Africa), meeting Chinese Premier Li Keqiang. Orbán met Chinese President Xi Jinping in October 2023, on the occasion of a further Belt and Road Forum for International Co-operation held in Beijing (where he attracted criticism from Western allies for meeting Russian President Putin).</p>

        On 1 January 2012 a new Constitution entered into force, renaming the country from the `Republic of Hungary’ to `Hungary’; constitutional amendments were approved by the legislature in March 2013. Legislative power is held by the unicameral National Assembly (Országgyülés), which comprises 199 members, elected for a term of four years by universal adult suffrage, under a mixed system of proportional and direct representation. The President of the Republic (head of state) is elected by the National Assembly for a term of five years. The President may be re-elected for a second term. The Council of Ministers, the highest organ of state administration, is elected by the Assembly on the recommendation of the President. Judicial power is exercised by local courts, labour courts, county courts (or the Metropolitan Court) and the Supreme Court. All judicial offices are filled by election. For local administrative purposes, Hungary is divided into 19 counties (
        <i>megyei</i>
        ) and the capital city. There are 168 town authorities (
        <i>városi</i>
        ), of which 23 larger towns or cities with populations of over 50,000 claim separate county status.

               <p id="HU.IS.52">In 2022, according to estimates by the World Bank, Hungary’s gross national income (GNI), measured at average 2020-22 prices, was US&#160;$184,079m., equivalent to $19,010 per head (or $40,620 per head on an international purchasing-power parity basis). During 2013-22, it was estimated, the population decreased at an average annual rate of 0.2%, while gross domestic product (GDP) per head increased, in real terms, by an average of 3.7% per year.

               <p id="HU.IS.59">In 2022 Hungary recorded a visible merchandise trade deficit of US&#160;$15,860.0m. and a deficit of $14,240.1m. on the current account of the balance of payments. In that year the principal source of imports was Germany (accounting for 21.1% of the total); other major sources were Austria, the People’s Republic of China, Slovakia, the Russian Federation and Poland. Germany was also the principal market for exports in that year (taking 25.2% of the total); other important purchasers were Italy, Romania and Slovakia.

               <p id="HU.IS.62">
        High GDP growth, recorded in Hungary in 2018-19, was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to the imposition of a state of emergency in March 2020, with severe constraints on economic activity. In April the Anti-Epidemic Protection Fund and the Economy Protection Fund were established to protect employment and support businesses. After a sharp economic contraction in 2020, GDP growth recovered to 7.2% in 2021. Following the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Hungary expressed concerns over the imposition of EU sanctions targeting the Russian energy industry, and in May was granted a temporary exemption from a ban on Russian oil pipeline supplies. Amid a global energy crisis ensuing from the war in Ukraine, inflation in Hungary reached 24.5% in December (the highest rate in the EU), after the Government early that month lifted a cap on fuel prices in response to unprecedented fuel shortages. Although GDP grew by 4.6% in 2022, the country entered recession in the third quarter of that year as the elevated inflation rate subdued economic activity, and GDP contracted by 0.3% in 2023, according to the IMF. Meanwhile, the release of EU cohesion funds totalling €21,700m., which was allocated to Hungary under the 2021-27 budget, was suspended, pending the fulfilment of reforms. In November 2023 the European Commission approved Hungary's amended Recovery and Resilience Plan (RRP), comprising €6,500m. in grants and €3,900m. in loans, although the disbursement of funds also remained conditional on the implementation of 27 essential reforms to address law and order issues; €920m. in pre-financing under the RRP was released to provide liquidity for energy projects. The European Commission on 13 December permitted the release of €10,200m. in EU cohesion funds, following the Government’s implementation of judicial reforms, with €11,500m. remaining suspended. The rate of inflation declined to 5.5% by December 2023; however, according to official estimates, the budget deficit for that year was forecast to reach
        
         5.9%, mainly due to a decline in tax revenues.
