               <chron-text>The postponed elections in the Serb-majority municipalities of North Mitrovicë, Leposaviq (Leposavić), Zubin Potok and Zveçan (Zvečan) took place. However, only some 3.5% of the electorate participated in the polls, owing to a Srpska Lista boycott, and thus resulting in the election of ethnic Albanian candidates.</chron-text>

It was subsequently announced that NATO was to deploy additional troops to Kosovo. In early June, amid international pressure, Kosovo indicated it would be willing to repeat the elections.</chron-text>
