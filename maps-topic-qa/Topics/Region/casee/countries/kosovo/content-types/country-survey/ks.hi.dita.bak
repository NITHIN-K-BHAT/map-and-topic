    From the first century 
    <sc>ce</sc>
     Kosovo was a region, part of the Roman, Byzantine, Bulgarian, Serbian and Ottoman Empires, consecutively, with a mixed Albanian and Slavic population. The Ottomans spread Islam among parts of the population in Kosovo and governed as the absolute ruler between 1455 and 1912. Between 1878 and 1912, the period of the Albanian national awakening, Kosovo, with a predominantly Albanian population, was one of the regions where some nationalist organizations originated, with the aim of establishing an independent Albania. During the Balkan wars of 1912-13, when the state of Albania was created, Kosovo was split between the kingdoms of Serbia, principally, and Montenegro.

          <heading>Kosovo in Yugoslavia</heading>
          <p id="KS.HI.P2">After the First World War, the Great Powers gave Kosovo to Serbia, and Serb settlers were awarded special privileges in order to repopulate the region. In 1918-29 the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes witnessed an increase in the Serbian population in the region. Albanian movements were suppressed by the Serbs, provoking anti-Serb sentiments among Albanians. During the Second World War, when Yugoslavia was occupied by the Axis powers and divided between Italy and Germany, Kosovo was mainly under Italian control and, for a brief period between 1941 and 1943, was united with Albania, while a smaller eastern region was under Bulgarian control. Owing to their antipathy towards Serbia, Albanians in Kosovo failed to develop any strong resistance movement against fascist occupation.</p>
          <p id="KS.HI.P3">Following the liberation of Yugoslavia in 1945, Kosovo, renamed the Autonomous Region of Kosovo and Metohija, was initially part of the Federative People’s Republic of Yugoslavia, and in 1963 was incorporated into the renamed Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija, governed by a Serbian administration—the first time that it came to exist with its present boundaries. Tensions between ethnic Albanians and the Yugoslav Government increased, not only because of competing nationalisms but also on ideological grounds and over the province’s relations with Albania. There were Yugoslav suspicions that Kosovo Albanians were sympathizers of the Enver Hoxha regime in Albania. During the 1950s and 1960s Serbs and Montenegrins dominated the political, security and economic resources of Kosovo. This created deep resentment among Kosovo Albanians, whose demands for the territory attaining republican status within Yugoslavia intensified. From the mid-1960s Kosovo benefited from a wider process of decentralization and the partial federalization of Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav leader, Josip Broz (Tito), devised an intermediate arrangement for Kosovo that gave the region the right of veto over federal government decisions, while maintaining its formal status as a province of Serbia, and denying it the formal right of secession that belonged, in principle, to the republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.</p>
          <p>In the 1970s an ethnic Albanian nationalist movement demanded the full recognition of the province of Kosovo as a republic within the Federation, while some maximalists among them sought full independence. Albanians felt that they were treated as second-class citizens, compared with citizens of the `constituent nations’ of Yugoslavia. In the 1974 Constitution, the Kosovo authorities acquired greater powers, with a President and premier and a seat in the Federal Presidency, which made it, in terms of its rights and responsibilities, a de facto Socialist Republic within the Federation, while remaining de jure as a Socialist Autonomous Province within the Socialist Republic of Serbia. Tito favoured a relative strengthening of the powers of Kosovo and of Vojvodina (the other autonomous province of Serbia) in order to weaken Serbia, which by then had become particularly dominant within Yugoslavia. Subsequently, Serbo-Croatian and Albanian became the official languages of the province, while Albanian-language schools and an Albanian-language university were allowed to open in Kosovo. These rights, combined with the high birth rate of Albanians and the emigration of Serbs to other parts of Yugoslavia, further changed the ethnic balance of Kosovo. Albanians came to account for over 90% of the total population, while the proportion of Serbs decreased to around 8%, from 27% in the 1950s. Following the introduction of the 1974 Constitution, the communist officials in Kosovo instituted a campaign of discrimination against non-Albanians. Serbs and other non-Albanians, such as the Roma, Turks and Macedonians, were removed from jobs and positions within the regional government apparatus. These repressions and grievances were effectively hidden within the pretence of the Yugoslav `Brotherhood and Unity’ policy instituted by Tito. Kosovo remained the poorest region of the former Yugoslavia, with a modern economy only established after a series of federal development subsidies during the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
          <p>Kosovo attracted international attention in 1981, one year after Tito’s death. Albanians organized riots demanding that the status of Kosovo be upgraded to that of a republic within Yugoslavia. During the 1980s ethnic riots in Kosovo continued, with frequent violent outbreaks against Serbs and the Yugoslav authorities. Thus ensued further Kosovo Serb emigration and increasing Serb protests against discrimination, physical harassment and destruction of property. This discontent spread further within Serbia, which was becoming exasperated not just at the treatment of Serbs in Kosovo, but also by the fact that during the economic downturn of the 1980s Serbia was the only republic contributing to the economy of Kosovo, receiving very little in return.</p>
          <p>Serbian nationalist politician Slobodan Milošević easily succeeded in capitalizing on Serbian anger and used the public disaffection to further his own political aims during his rise to become leader of the League of Communists of Serbia in 1986. By the end of the 1980s there were more and more Serbian demands for increased federal control over the autonomous province. Upon his first visit to Kosovo in 1987 to listen to Serb grievances, Milošević, after hearing complaints about police brutality, famously declared to an angry crowd that `nobody should dare to beat you again’. This scene was broadcast on television evening news, making Milošević a leading exponent of Serb nationalism in Kosovo. Upon becoming President of Serbia (a position that he held in 1989-97, before his tenure as President of Yugoslavia—by then comprising only Serbia and Montenegro—in 1997-2000), Milošević pressed for constitutional change, suspending the autonomous status of both Kosovo and Vojvodina in 1990.</p>
          <p>Although the unrest in Kosovo signalled the beginning of the disintegration of Yugoslavia, the wars in Croatia (1991-95) and Bosnia and Herzegovina (1992-95) dominated the initial years of the Yugoslav dissolution. For their part, Kosovo’s Albanian leaders declared unilateral independence in 1991 and pursued a `passive resistance’ movement under the leadership of academic Ibrahim Rugova during most of the 1990s. During that time Kosovo Albanians established their own unofficial `shadow’ institutions, in parallel to the repressive Serbian rule.</p>
          <p>Following the end of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo became the next major battleground within Yugoslavia. The co-existence of Albanians and Serbs in the province had become untenable, and the brutality of Milošević’s regime was increasingly unbearable to Albanians. Serbian rule had dismantled the regional administration, disarmed the local police and security, curtailed most of the rights of the Albanians, and had implemented repressive policing. The exclusion of the consideration of Kosovo’s status from the negotiations that led to the conclusion of the Dayton Peace Agreement in November 1995 (which principally concerned Bosnia and Herzegovina) undermined Rugova’s strategy of `passive resistance’ and eroded his credibility among Kosovo Albanian radicals, who established a clandestine militant organization, the Ushtria Çlirimtare e Kosovës (UÇK—Kosovo Liberation Army).</p>
          <p>It was during that time that Kosovo Albanians became more militant and the UÇK began to dominate the Kosovo countryside, leading the struggle for independence and pursuing open conflict with the Serbian police. This provoked heavy retaliation from the security forces of Yugoslavia, which killed Albanians indiscriminately. It was estimated that some 300,000 Albanians were driven out of Kosovo in 1998. During a series of unsuccessful international attempts to bring a peaceful end to the conflict Milošević continued his premeditated campaign of `ethnic cleansing’, forcing an exodus of Albanians from Kosovo, and finally prompting international military intervention by a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)-led force in March-June 1999. It was estimated that in 1998-99 some 1m. Kosovo Albanians were displaced within Kosovo or became refugees in neighbouring countries. The scenes on broadcast media of large numbers of Kosovo Albanians fleeing their homes in Kosovo caused an international outcry and condemnation of the regime of Milošević and his followers in Serbia. Over a year after the end of the NATO military intervention, the Serbian people ousted Milošević and brought democracy to their country, yet, following the regime’s harsh rule in Kosovo, ultimately lost a territory that was claimed as being integral to their own nationalism.</p>

          <heading>Kosovo as an International Protectorate</heading>
          <p id="KS.HI.P4">The NATO military intervention ended with a Serbian defeat and led to the establishment of the United Nations (UN) Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), based on UN Security Council Resolution 1244 of 10 June 1999, which ordered the withdrawal of all Yugoslav military, police and paramilitary forces from Kosovo and authorized the deployment of international military and civilian personnel. Kosovo remained, formally, part of Yugoslavia and its successor (in 2003-06), the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, although it was effectively an international protectorate. The principal international concerns focused around the return of refugees to their homes, the disarmament of the UÇK, and combating paramilitary Albanian organizations. In the medium term, the international administrators hoped to create a functioning political and economic system, and a democratically elected provisional government, parliament and presidency under UN supervision, while endeavouring to sustain the multicultural character of the province. All this had to be accomplished before the status of the province was discussed, in what became known as the `standards before status’ approach. However, retaliation from the predominantly Albanian population had caused large numbers of Serbs (estimated at some 200,000 prior to the conflict) to flee the province, while those that remained complained that they, and members of other minority ethnic groups, were subject to severe discrimination by Albanians, despite the apparent protection of the UN and NATO peacekeeping troops. Instead of participating in the internationally promoted local Kosovo institutions, Kosovo Serbs maintained parallel structures and direct links with the Serbian authorities in Belgrade, the Serbian capital. This was particularly evident in Mitrovicë (Kosovska Mitrovica) in northern Kosovo, a city divided, largely on ethnic grounds, by the River Ibër (Ibar), with the Serbs living to the north of the river and the Albanians to the south. Beyond North Mitrovicë, a number of additional municipalities adjacent to Serbia also remained firmly under Serb control and to a considerable extent continued to function as part of Serbia. The remaining Kosovo Serbs lived in enclaves protected by the UN and NATO forces.</p>
          <p id="KS.HI.P5">An outbreak of violence in March 2004, when Albanian crowds set fire to Serb enclaves and drove out villagers, resulted in 19 deaths and prompted the flight of around 5,000 Serbs and Roma. Albanian protesters demanded the immediate independence of Kosovo and turned against the international community and UNMIK officials. Over the following years, the resolution of the status of Kosovo was one of the most urgent international issues that concerned the major powers, the USA, the Russian Federation, the European Union (EU) and the UN.</p>
          <p id="KS.HI.P6">In 2005 Martti Ahtisaari, the Finnish former President who had assisted in mediating the ceasefire agreement between NATO and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1999, was appointed as the UN Special Envoy for the Future Status Process for Kosovo with the mandate to supervise negotiations for a final status. When negotiations commenced in Vienna, Austria, in February 2006, the views of the Serb and Kosovo Albanian delegations were diametrically opposed. Kosovo Albanians were seeking full independence, while Serbs demanded `more than autonomy, less than independence’ and sought to retain sovereignty, only one seat at the UN for the whole of the internationally recognized territory of Serbia, and control of the external borders. Following protracted efforts to mediate a resolution, based on a plan for a comprehensive solution to the Kosovo status settlement drafted by Ahtisaari, the EU, the USA and Russia, it was concluded that no agreement could be reached on Kosovo’s final status.</p>

     <gen-section print-style="COLUMN" sllink="SLSDOC" slsdocrf="GEN-SECTREF">
          <heading>Declaration of Independence</heading>
          <p id="KS.HI.P9">On 17 February 2008 the Kuvendi i Kosovës/Skupština Kosova (Kosovo Assembly) unanimously endorsed a unilateral declaration of independence from Serbia, amid celebrations in the capital, Prishtina (Prishtinë—Priština).</p>
          <p id="KS.HI.P10">The declaration approved by the Assembly contained limitations on independence as outlined in the Ahtisaari plan: Kosovo, or part of it, was unable to join any other country and it would be supervised by an international presence, and Kosovo’s armed forces would be limited and would have to make strong provisions for the protection of the Serb minority. The declaration of independence prompted a worldwide debate regarding the international legitimacy, the viability and the merits of recognizing Kosovo as a state. Several governments with separatist movements of their own refused to recognize Kosovo, anxious that they might be setting a precedent, and argued against recognition, on the grounds that there was no agreement between Serbia and Kosovo and no clear UN Security Council mandate. Other states endorsed the declaration as a unique and justified move and the inevitable outcome to the developments in Kosovo during the preceding decade. Nations supporting independence, led by the USA, the United Kingdom, Germany and France, argued that settlement of the final status of Kosovo would serve stability in the Balkans. This was not entirely convincing to other governments, which anticipated either the potential for the future creation of a Greater Albania or a heightened risk of secessionism within their own territories.</p>
          <p id="KS.HI.P11">As expected, Kosovo’s declaration of independence caused political turmoil in Serbia. In order to appease Serbia’s protests and complaints, and with a view to supporting the pro-EU Prime Minister Boris Tadić, the EU signed a Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) with Serbia on 29 April 2008. However, the EU was not able to adopt a common position on the recognition of Kosovo, since five member states (Cyprus, Greece, Romania, Slovakia and Spain) had their own internal reasons to react against a unilateral declaration of independence. Despite this lack of unity, the EU committed to deploy a civilian mission to strengthen law and order in Kosovo, the EU Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX), which comprised judges, prosecutors and customs officials. On 15 June a new Constitution entered into force in Kosovo, transferring power to the Kosovo Government after nine years of UN rule.</p>

          <heading>Kosovo’s Post-independence Politics and Relations with Serbia</heading>
          <p>Upon independence, Kosovo became a multi-party parliamentary democratic republic, with a President as the Head of State, elected by the Assembly, and a Prime Minister as the Head of Government. Post-independence domestic party politics in Kosovo have been fragmented and volatile, with generally free and fair competitive electoral practices, but with many difficulties concerning the sustainability of coalition governments, the weak implementation of legislation, rule of law problems, political interference in the criminal justice system, and allegations of corruption and war crimes. </p>
          <p>Prior to 2020, Kosovo’s political system was largely dominated by several parties that governed in varying coalition configurations. The centre-right Lidhja Demokratike e Kosovës (LDK—Democratic League of Kosovo), Kosovo’s oldest party, has roots in non-violent resistance to Serbian rule during the 1990s. The Partia Demokratike e Kosovës (PDK—Democratic Party of Kosovo), the LDK’s main rival, grew out of the armed UÇK resistance and was headed by Hashim Thaçi, a former UÇK leader. Although many in Kosovo credit these established parties with resisting Serbian rule and helping to bring about independence, critics assert that the parties also became embedded in state institutions and bear considerable responsibility for Kosovo’s corruption issues. The broader political landscape included a number of smaller Albanian parties, as well as several parties that represented the Serb, Bosniak, Roma, Turkish and other minority communities. More recently, political power shifted from these longstanding parties to reform-orientated political groups, including Vetëvendosje (Self-Determination), a radical left-wing movement, which entered into national government for the first time in February 2020, after narrowly winning parliamentary elections in October 2019 under the leadership of Albin Kurti.</p>
          <p>One of the main sources of political and security tensions in Kosovo came from the north, predominantly inhabited by Serbs supported financially by the Serbian Government, operating on parallel state structures, and who refused to accept Kosovo’s sovereignty and the legitimacy of elections in Kosovo. In addition, Serbia boycotted any regional and international meetings that included representatives of the Kosovo Government and at which Kosovo was regarded as an equal state. Serbia’s decision to refer the case of Kosovo’s declaration of independence to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to assess its legality, was stymied in July 2010, when the Court issued a non-binding, advisory opinion that the declaration had not been in breach of international law, UN Security Council Resolution 1244, or the constitutional framework. Nevertheless, Serbia reaffirmed its intention to continue to withhold recognition of independence, but following pressure from the EU agreed to support a UN resolution in favour of dialogue between the Kosovo and Serbian authorities to resolve outstanding technical issues, such as trade, transport, energy, air controls, freedom of movement and telecommunications. Serbian and Kosovo representatives engaged in high-level discussions in March 2011.</p>
          <p>The two sides worked towards reaching a normalization agreement, of which the most controversial issue related to the establishment and competencies of an Association/Community of Serb Municipalities. On 19 April 2013 a significant agreement, sponsored by the EU, was signed between the two parties and welcomed as a great success. The 15-point agreement, which was initialled by then Prime Minister Thaçi and his Serbian counterpart, Ivica Dačić, did not require Serbia to recognize Kosovo, but specified that neither side would block the other from joining the EU and, among other issues, provided for the common administration of four Serb-majority communities in northern Kosovo.</p>
          <p>The normalization agreement yielded some progress in a limited number of areas, including the participation of Serbs in municipal elections in the north, the creation of a joint Kosovo police force and the signing of an agreement on integrating the courts in Serb-dominated northern Kosovo into the Kosovo judicial system and agreeing on their ethnic structure. However, there was no progress on the formation of the `Association/Community of Serb Municipalities’, especially after the Kosovo Government froze its establishment, following a decision by Kosovo’s Constitutional Court in 2015 that this was incompatible with the state’s Basic Law. Since then overall progress has stalled, with each side blaming the other for the deadlock amid occasional inflammatory incidents. </p>
          <p>In January 2018 Oliver Ivanović, a moderate leader in the Serb community of Kosovo, was assassinated. Ivanović had been critical towards the Serbian Government and had been considered a `traitor’ by some Serb nationalists, having characteristically stated that Serbs in northern Kosovo were more afraid of Serb criminals than of Kosovo Albanians. Six Kosovo Serbs believed to be associated with a criminal group were indicted by Kosovo courts on charges of responsibility for the murder. More than three years after the assassination, in July 2021 the trial of the six suspects opened in Prishtina; however, in the course of the proceedings many witnesses to the murder were reluctant to confirm previous testimonies that they had given to the prosecution, relating to the identification of the alleged members of organized criminal groups operating in the north of Kosovo.</p>
          <p>From the beginning, the implementation of the normalization agreement caused severe disruption within Kosovo’s domestic politics, with some opposition parties protesting vehemently against the agreement—as well as a border demarcation accord with neighbouring Montenegro—and resisting government attempts to bypass the Assembly on the question of their ratification. Opposition tactics during parliamentary sessions included blowing whistles, throwing eggs, and opening tear gas canisters inside the chamber on various occasions, as well as mobilizing large demonstrations in the streets, some of which resulted in serious clashes with the police. Vetëvendosje, with its two allies, the Aleanca për Ardhmërinë e Kosovës (AAK—Alliance for the Future of Kosovo) and the Nisma për Kosovën (NISMA—Initiative for Kosovo), obstructed parliamentary activity on various occasions. Emboldened by the ruling of the Constitutional Court, which temporarily suspended implementation of the normalization agreement in November 2015, the opposition staged a series of protests against the government coalition, led by the PDK and the LDK. For the opposition, particularly Vetëvendosje, the agreement was indicative of the Government’s weakness, its dependence on foreign patronage, and its readiness to dilute Kosovo's sovereignty and grant too many powers to the Serbian minority.</p>
          <p>Under the increasing pressure of the three opposition parties, some parliamentary deputies of the governing coalition parties rejected the controversial border agreement with Montenegro, resulting in the Government’s failure to command the two-thirds’ majority in the Assembly needed for its ratification. Amid a very unstable political climate, President Thaçi was obliged to schedule early parliamentary elections for June 2017, after the Government of Prime Minister Isa Mustafa was dismissed in a no confidence motion. At the elections on 11 June, the PDK-led coalition secured 33.7% of the votes cast and 39 of the 120 seats, while Vetëvendosje increased its support significantly to 27.5% and 32 seats, and the coalition led by Mustafa’s LDK was placed third, with 25.5% and 29 seats. In September Ramush Haradinaj, the leader of the AAK and a former UÇK commander, was narrowly elected Prime Minister, receiving the support of 61 of the 120 legislative deputies. His new coalition Government comprised an alliance of the PDK, the AAK and the NISMA.</p>
          <p>In March 2018 the Kosovo authorities deported Marko Đurić, the head of the Serbian Government’s Office for Kosovo and Metohija, after police arrested him in North Mitrovicë for alleged illegal entry into Kosovo. Amid a deteriorating climate, an attempt by the EU to bring about another round of dialogue in March ended in failure. In August of that year reports emerged of discussion between the Presidents of Kosovo and Serbia, Thaçi and Vučić, over proposals for an official exchange of territory between Kosovo and Serbia as a way to end the impasse; these envisaged the potential exchange of the Preševo valley in southern Serbia, mainly populated by ethnic Albanians, for the Serb-majority area north of the Ibar river, which included North Mitrovicë. The proposed exchange drew mixed reactions, partly owing to concerns that it would generate demands for a similar arrangement in the Republika Srpska entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Some also feared that Vučić supported the notion of a territorial exchange in order to create a `Greater Serbia’ (with the Serb-populated regions of Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina), an aspiration of the Milošević era. As a result, reactions within Kosovo itself varied considerably, and the issue became a highly divisive topic in Kosovo’s domestic politics.</p>
          <p>In September 2018 the Kosovo authorities barred Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić from visiting a Serb-majority area in Kosovo. Once again, efforts by the EU to bring the two sides back to negotiations ended in failure. In November Kosovo imposed a 100% custom tariff on Serbian imports, holding the Serbian Government responsible for its third unsuccessful application to join the international police agency INTERPOL (after it had spent a reported €1.2m. lobbying for membership). The impact of the new tariff was harmful to the trade of both countries, since Kosovo had imported some €400m. worth of goods from Serbia each year. The EU condemned the tariff as a clear violation of the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA), while the USA, the closest ally of Kosovo, severely criticized the measure.</p>
          <p>In July 2019 Prime Minister Haradinaj (who had previously twice been acquitted of war crimes) resigned, after being summoned by the Kosovo Specialist Prosecutor’s Office (SPO) in The Hague, Netherlands, in connection with the UÇK insurgency. In the ensuing pre-term legislative elections on 6 October, Vetëvendosje, led by Albin Kurti, won 29 seats in the Assembly, narrowly ahead of the centre-right LDK, with 28. After four months of negotiations, Kurti was approved as Prime Minister of a coalition Government largely comprising the two parties, but his administration proved short-lived. On 25 March 2020 his Government collapsed after the adoption of a parliamentary vote of no confidence brought by the smaller coalition party, the LDK, on the grounds that Kurti had violated their coalition agreement by dismissing the LDK Minister of Internal Affairs without consultation, amid disagreement over measures to combat the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. In reality, the divisive issues originated with relations with Serbia and, in particular, the 100% tariff on Serbian goods, the influence of the EU’s mediated talks with Serbia and the interventionist role of the USA. In addition, there was profound disagreement between President Thaçi and Prime Minister Kurti, on their respective authorities to manage the foreign affairs of the country.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the Kurti Government sought to replace the 100% tariff under the principle of reciprocity (with concessions granted by one state to be returned in an equivalent manner by the other), but came under significant pressure from Richard Grenell, the US special envoy on the Kosovo-Serbia dialogue appointed by President Donald Trump, to abandon both the tariff and the principle. The first divisions in the coalition had appeared when the LDK began to take on Grenell’s view, claiming that it did not wish to endanger US-Kosovo relations and threatening to leave the Government if Vetëvendosje insisted on reciprocity. For his part, Kurti accused Grenell of being directly involved in removing his Government and accused Thaçi of making clandestine deals with Serbian President Vučić during a recent visit to Washington, DC, USA. Kurti’s outgoing administration (which remained in office in an interim capacity) announced the adoption of the reciprocity principle at the end of March 2020.</p>
          <p>On 3 June 2020 a new Government led by Avdullah Hoti, the deputy leader of the LDK, was confirmed in office by the Assembly, after the Constitutional Court decided that President Thaçi’s decree awarding a mandate to Hoti was in accordance with the Constitution. With Vetëvendosje representatives boycotting the session and only 86 deputies present in the 120-seat chamber, 61 voted in favour of the new cabinet and 24 against. The new coalition Government comprised members of the LDK, the NISMA, the AAK and the ethnic Serb party, Srpska Lista (Serb List). Shortly afterwards, Hoti’s Government announced its decision to abolish the reciprocity principle.</p>
          <p>On 4 September 2020 Kosovo Prime Minister Hoti, Serbian President Vučić and US President Trump signed documents on `economic normalization’, referred to as the Washington Agreement. These consisted of 16 points mainly concerning economic co-operation, rail and transit links—including provision for the resumption of direct flights between Prishtina and Belgrade after 21 years—the mutual recognition of diplomas, Kosovo’s commitment to join a proposed `Mini Schengen’ zone between Serbia, Albania and North Macedonia, a one-year moratorium on Serbian lobbying of states to withdraw recognition of Kosovo, and a suspension of Kosovo’s efforts to join international organizations.</p>
          <p>Early legislative elections were scheduled, after the Constitutional Court ruled in December 2020 that the Government led by the LDK was illegitimate, since its approval by the Assembly in June, with the vote of a deputy who had a recent criminal conviction, was considered invalid. The Court also ruled that Kurti himself would be barred from contesting the elections, on the grounds of a previous conviction. He and his former justice minister, Albulena Haxhiu, had received suspended prison sentences imposed by a Prishtina court in January 2018 for involvement in the 2015 tear gas protests staged by opposition deputies in the Assembly.</p>
          <p>In the early elections on 14 February 2021, Kurti’s Vetëvendosje secured victory with 50.3% of the votes cast (the highest share that any party had received since 1999, and acclaimed by some in Kosovo as the `Obama hope moment’). The PDK and the LDK, which were both associated with the past wars and corruption for many voters, obtained 17.0% and 12.7% of the votes, respectively. Since Vetëvendosje had elected 58 of the 120 deputies, Kurti managed to form his Government with representatives of minority parties, without the need to include any other major party (unlike the previous coalition administrations); it was approved with 67 votes in the Assembly on 22 March. As the candidate proposed by the winning party, Kurti received the mandate of Prime Minister, despite his ban from contesting the elections. For the first time in Kosovo’s short history, voters entrusted a single political party to lead the country, which was able to form a Government without the support of any of the larger parties.</p>
          <p>Among its first acts and as a break with past foreign policy practices, the new Government proceeded to dismiss a series of ambassadors, considering their appointments to have been politically motivated. Apart from its disagreements over the country’s foreign policy and relations with Serbia, the new Government was highly critical of the management of the economy hitherto, and declared the fight against corruption and the creation of jobs to be a priority. It was particularly critical of the previous privatization process and pledged to abolish the Privatization Agency in favour of a `sovereign fund’. </p>
          <p>In June 2021 Kurti met Vučić for a new round of EU-facilitated dialogue, but the process rapidly stalled. The two sides in September entered into a dispute over the licence plates used by Serbian-registered vehicles entering Kosovo, which precipitated a brief blockade of Kosovo’s northern border by Kosovo Serb protesters and, despite a mediated interim agreement, proved very difficult to resolve. After more than a year, Kurti and Vučić resumed dialogue at an EU-brokered meeting held in Brussels, Belgium, on 18 August 2022. This took place in the context of renewed fears that tensions might escalate in protest against rule changes that would ban the use of Serbian car licence plates and ID cards in Kosovo. The system of vehicle registration in Kosovo is complicated, as there are three different types of vehicle licence plates since 2008: one issued by UNMIK (KS plates); one issued by Serbia for towns in Kosovo (KM for Mitrovica, PR, PZ and others); and plates issued by Kosovo itself, marked RKS. The Kosovo Government insisted that only RKS plates could be used and that this was a matter of reciprocity, since Kosovo-issued plates are not recognized in Serbia; to that end, Kurti set a deadline for changing to Kosovo plates, which provoked significant opposition in the Serb-populated northern municipalities. On 5 November Serb officials, led by parliamentary deputies, mayors and magistrates, began to resign from Kosovo institutions, reportedly in response to the suspension of the regional police chief in northern Kosovo, Nenad Đurić, for refusing to assist in replacing Serbia-issued car licence plates. This was followed by yet another series of violent protests and road blockades by local Serbs in December, and mutual recriminations between Serbia and Kosovo.</p>
          <p>Under severe pressure from the EU and the USA, discussions between the two sides resumed, based on a draft plan for a deal between Kosovo and Serbia, which France and Germany had presented in September 2022. The plan, which had secured endorsement from all EU member states, including those that did not recognize Kosovo, was known as the `European proposal’, and followed the outline of a 1972 agreement between East and West Germany which had allowed both to obtain widespread recognition, join the UN and establish diplomatic relations, without explicitly recognizing the other. </p>
          <p>On 27 February 2023 both sides agreed on the text and left the implementation annex to be finalized at a later date. The European proposal provided for the development of normal, good-neighbourly relations on the basis of equal rights; the recognition of respective documents and national symbols; a commitment by Serbia not to prevent Kosovo from joining any international organization; self-management for the Serb community in Kosovo; the exchange of permanent diplomatic missions; and the fulfilment of outstanding commitments agreed under the EU-mediated dialogue. Implementation of the agreement was to be monitored by a joint committee chaired by the EU.</p>
          <p>The annex concerning the implementation of the accord was agreed on 18 March 2023 by Kurti and Vučić in Ohrid, North Macedonia, and stipulated that Kosovo would immediately launch negotiations on establishing specific arrangements for Kosovo Serb self-management; the joint monitoring committee chaired by the EU would start work within 30 days and an EU-organized donor conference would take place within 150 days. Investment and financial aid would be disbursed to Kosovo and Serbia only after they had implemented the agreement. The EU argued that the agreement and the annex were legally binding and that the implementation annex had become part of the requirements in the EU accession process for both Serbia and Kosovo. However, as this was an oral agreement, no documents had been signed by either leader, which raised serious concerns regarding commitment to its implementation.</p>
          <p>The most sensitive of all the issues continued to be self-government for Serbs in Kosovo and the creation of the `Association/Community of Serb Municipalities’, which Kurti and his Vetëvendosje opposed, preferring a lower level of self-management. On 23 April by-elections were held in four Serb-majority municipalities in northern Kosovo—North Mitrovicë, Leposaviq (Leposavić), Zubin Potok and Zveçan (Zvečan)—to establish new local authorities. The elections were the outcome of the mass resignation by Serb officials from Kosovo institutions in November 2022. However, only 1,567 people, 3.5% of about 45,000 eligible voters, participated in the polls, due to a widely observed boycott by Srpska Lista, the main political force in the area, as well as other Serb parties. The Serbian authorities were supportive of the boycott. </p>
          <p>Following the boycott, Serb inhabitants of Leposaviq, Zubin Potok and Zveçan rallied against the appointment of mayors from the ethnic-Albanian parties based in Prishtina. The US embassy harshly criticized the Kosovo authorities for using armed special police to enable the disputed mayors to enter the municipal buildings. Clashes followed, during which peacekeepers of the NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR) were injured. As a result, at the end of May 2023 NATO sent more troops to Kosovo and the USA suspended Kosovo’s participation in NATO military exercises, an embarrassment to Kurti’s Government. On 2 June, under severe US pressure Kurti conditionally agreed to new by-elections being held in the four Serb-majority municipalities in northern Kosovo.</p>

          <heading>War Crimes</heading>
          <p>Meanwhile, some prominent Kosovo political elites were involved in allegations of war crimes during the war in Kosovo. In June 2020 the SPO filed a 10-count indictment charging President Thaçi and three other former UÇK commanders with crimes against humanity and war crimes committed in 1998-99. They later released documents accusing senior politicians, including Thaçi, of attempting to interfere with potential prosecution witnesses ahead of their impending trials. In November President Thaçi resigned, after the war crimes indictment against him, including criminal responsibility for the murder of around 100 ethnic Albanians, Serbs and Roma in Kosovo, was confirmed by the Kosovo Specialist Chambers (KSC) in The Hague, which had been established in 2015 to investigate war crimes during the Kosovo conflict. Thaçi and the other three former leaders subsequently pleaded not guilty to the charges at The Hague. Thousands rallied in Prishtina on 2 April 2023, the day before the court hearings began at the KSC. Demonstrators viewed the trial as an attack against the UÇK and its `just war’ against the Milošević regime, and objected to the description of the defendants, part of the former movement's senior leadership, in the indictment as members of a joint criminal enterprise. Kurti, a political opponent of Thaçi and the PDK, kept a low profile on the trial. However, the Prime Minister has taken a tough stance on war crimes perpetrated by Serbian forces. He threatened Serbia with a genocide case at an international court, but also urged the authorities in Belgrade to reveal information about more than 1,600 wartime missing persons, seeking to make the issue part of a future settlement with Serbia. </p>
          <p>Unlike other countries in the Western Balkans, Kosovo’s judicial system involves a complex blend of international and local actors. UNMIK established the Kosovo judicial system during 1999-2008. UNMIK courts processed many war crimes cases but showed little capacity to deliver tangible results. The process of transferring control from UNMIK to EULEX in 2008 exposed deep structural flaws. EULEX inherited 1,200 war crimes cases from UNMIK, of which 500 were closed due to insufficient evidence. In addition, 300 cases were still pending with Kosovo and EULEX prosecutors, casting doubt on the capacities of local courts.</p>

          <heading>Economy and Emigration</heading>
          <p>Among the greatest challenges in Kosovo are the poor state of the economy, the extent of corruption and high unemployment. Despite years of consecutive growth, Kosovo remains the weakest economy in Europe, with gross domestic product (GDP) per head at around €4,000 and with 23% of the population classified as poor. Unemployment stands at more than 20% and there is considerable outward migration and a significant illicit economy.</p>
          <p>The economy of Kosovo functions almost entirely as a consumer society, based on relatively small-scale trade and small family businesses, and is principally sustained by remittances from abroad (mainly from Germany and Switzerland) and international funding. Despite years of substantial international assistance, it has remained an economy suffering from a heavy reliance on external fiscal transfers for investment, and dominated by subsistence agriculture. In addition, the World Bank has repeatedly expressed concerns over the fact that any capital investments tend to be under-implemented and the savings that these generate in the budget are used to finance unproductive expenditure without economic returns. Moreover, social spending, such as veterans’ benefits, teachers’ benefits, pensions and public sector wages, have a heavy fiscal impact. The main problem is that growth fails to generate new jobs, due to limitations in the private sector and the very small size of companies, usually numbering less than eight employees. </p>
          <p>Migration to the EU has been one of the major trends of recent years, as increasing numbers of citizens sought to escape poverty, unemployment and corruption in Kosovo. During the so-called `winter of discontent’ of 2014-15, emigration to the EU reached extremely high levels, with almost 5% of the population of Kosovo, most of them without visas, seeking to emigrate to the EU. The majority of asylum applications by emigrants from Kosovo were made in Germany, which is home to around one-half of all Kosovo Albanians living outside Kosovo. Kosovo continued to lose its young population, and according to Eurostat information on migration during 2007-18, its population declined by around 15%, among the highest percentages in the region of South-Eastern Europe. Around 190,000 Kosovo nationals are believed to have left the territory over a decade, despite a strict EU visa regime. Kosovo’s worldwide diaspora is estimated to be in the range of 700,000-800,000. </p>
          <p>As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020 Kosovo’s economy suffered its worst ever contraction (of 4.4%), with a significant drop in diaspora-related exports of travel services and investment, while the budget deficit more than doubled due to lower revenues and support measures. However, it experienced an economic recovery in 2021 and 2022, and the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) expected that the economy would grow by 3.5% in 2023 and by up to 4% in 2024.</p>

      Kosovo’s Membership of International Organiz

    </heading>
          <p>In foreign affairs, the EU enjoys consensus among Kosovo’s different political parties and the country’s inclusion in the Euro-Atlantic community remains an uncontested foreign policy objective. In May 2014 Kosovo concluded negotiations with the EU on a Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA), which laid the foundations for a prospective membership negotiation process. The SAA included provisions on trade, political dialogue, fundamental freedoms, security, justice and other policy areas covered in 10 chapters, five protocols and six annexes. In October 2015 the Government signed the SAA with the EU. In May 2016 the European Commission recommended to the Council of the EU and the European Parliament that Kosovo be granted a short-stay visa-free regime for the Schengen area of 26 EU and other European countries. Despite subsequent further recommendations for the removal of visa restrictions, it was only in March-April 2023 that the Council of the EU and the European Parliament voted to lift the visa requirement for Kosovo citizens no later than 1 January 2024. Kosovo passport holders would then be able to spend up to 90 days inside the Schengen area in any 180-day period. In December 2022 Kurti formally applied for Kosovo to join the EU, launching a process that could take years to advance and would be conditional on normalization with Serbia.</p>
          <p>As part of its efforts to gain international recognition, Kosovo joined the World Bank and the IMF in 2009, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in 2012, and applied for membership of NATO’s `Partnership for Peace’ (PfP) programme. In June 2014 it was admitted to the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe, an advisory panel on constitutional law. In October the International Olympic Committee granted full recognition to Kosovo, which was permitted to send an independent team to the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. On that occasion eight athletes represented Kosovo, and a judo champion won the state’s first Olympic gold medal. Kosovo was also permitted to enter a football team for the 2018 World Cup, after being accepted as a member of the international governing body, the Fédération Internationale de Football Association. Kosovo’s membership of other international organizations was blocked by Serbia, including its application to join the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), which was narrowly rejected by member countries of the organization in November 2015. This represented a diplomatic victory for Serbia, not only because it refused to recognize Kosovo as an independent state that can apply for membership of international organizations, but also because some of the most significant Serbian Orthodox monasteries and churches situated in Kosovo were already on the list of UNESCO world heritage sites, with the Serbian Government accusing the Kosovo authorities of failing to protect them adequately.</p>
          <p>Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, the Government of Kosovo requested an accelerated membership process into NATO and admission to its PfP programme. In addition, Kosovo applied for membership of the Council of Europe in May, after Russia’s expulsion from the organization. This provided a good opportunity for Kosovo to join as, without Russia, two-thirds of the member states recognize Kosovo, the required number for approval of membership. In April 2023 the Council of Europe voted to refer Kosovo’s application for membership to the body’s Parliamentary Assembly to prepare an opinion on membership. Amid Serbia’s pursuance of a derecognition campaign, at mid-2023 Kosovo was recognized as an independent sovereign state by at least 101 (of the 193) UN member states (after a number of countries had, or were alleged by Serbia to have, withdrawn recognition), while Russia and the People’s Republic of China, permanent members of the UN Security Council, continued to oppose Kosovo’s membership.</p>
