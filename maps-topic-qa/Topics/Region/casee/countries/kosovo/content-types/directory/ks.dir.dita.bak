                    <p>Following Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence on 17 February 2008, a new Constitution was adopted on 9 April, and officially entered into effect on 15 June. The Constitution defines the Republic of Kosovo as an independent, sovereign, democratic and indivisible state. The official languages are Albanian and Serbian, while the Turkish, Bosnian and Roma languages have the status of official languages at municipal level or as provided by law. The Kosovo Assembly (Kuvendi i Kosovës/Skupština Kosova) is the highest representative and legislative institution of Kosovo. The Assembly comprises 120 deputies, of whom 100 are directly elected. The remaining 20 seats are reserved for the elected representatives of specified minority ethnic communities. The President of Kosovo is elected by a two-thirds' majority of all deputies in the Assembly. The President appoints the candidate for Prime Minister, after proposal by the political party or coalition holding the majority of seats in the Assembly. The candidate for Prime Minister submits the composition of his Government for approval by the Assembly. All authorities in the Republic of Kosovo are to abide by all its obligations under the Comprehensive Proposal for the Kosovo Status Settlement of 26 March 2007, which takes precedence over all other legal provisions in Kosovo.</p>
