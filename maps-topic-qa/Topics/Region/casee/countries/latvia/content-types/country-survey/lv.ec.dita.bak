          <heading>Introduction</heading>
          <p>Latvia has changed beyond all recognition since independence was attained from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) in 1991. Latvia’s cities, towns, villages and rural areas have been transformed by extensive construction and renovation projects, while roads, ports and airports have also been revitalized by years of European Union (EU) structural funds spending. After low economic growth during the 1990s, Latvia recorded the highest rates in the EU in the years immediately following its accession in 2004, recording increases in gross domestic product (GDP) of 12.2% in 2006 and of 10.0% in 2007. The real income of those in employment rose by 33% in 2000-05 (and by almost 10% in 2005 alone). However, these gains were reversed as the Latvian economy entered recession in late 2008. In the course of the ensuing economic recession Latvia experienced a contraction in GDP matched only by the USA’s Great Depression (from 1929), with a cumulative decline of 23.9% over seven quarters in 2008-10. The severe downturn was accompanied by stringent austerity measures that involved tax increases together with sharp reductions in government spending on social benefits and investments, as well as job losses in the public sector. Nevertheless, the public appeared to accept the necessity of the reforms, and in parliamentary elections held in both October 2010 and September 2011 the Government that had carried out this radical restructuring of the economy was returned to power. The economy returned to growth in 2010, and from late 2011 it was once again one of the top three performing economies in the EU. The Government issued bonds, repaid the lending received from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and European Commission in early 2013 and became the 18th member of the eurozone on 1 January 2014. On 11 May 2016 Latvia was invited to join the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an association for developed market economies, and an accession agreement with the OECD was signed on 2 June. By the fourth quarter of 2019 the economy had grown for 37 consecutive quarters. The COVID-19 pandemic brought this growth to an end, although the 3.6% contraction of the economy in 2020 was one of the smallest in the EU and well below the EU-27 average decline of 6.1% of GDP, and the economy recovered to record growth of 4.8% in 2021. However, the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 had a severe impact on the Latvian economy, with GDP growth declining to 2.0%, while the central bank, the Bank of Latvia, projected growth of just 0.5% in 2023.</p>
          <p>The 2008-10 economic contraction was the most severe since the first years of post-Soviet independence, which were marked by recession and social crisis. The economy declined by 6.4% in 1991, by 32.9% in 1992 and by 20.0% in 1993, before a tentative recovery in 1994. Real wages fell by around 60% between 1990 and 1992. The 1994 collapse of Latvia’s largest bank, Banka Baltija, followed by the failure of 14 other banks over the next year, slowed economic recovery. The Russian economic crisis of 1998 provided a further shock. Although the economy experienced an unprecedented period of rapid, uninterrupted economic growth after 1999, the speed of economic development was followed by recession in 2008. A slowdown&#160;had been anticipated for some time, and the IMF&#160;had been encouraging the Latvian Government to balance its budget and to reduce spending since 2006. However, owing to a combination of political hubris and administrative mismanagement this advice was not followed. As a result, in late 2008 the Government was forced to negotiate IMF-led assistance, amounting to €7,500m. of loans (equivalent to 35% of Latvia’s GDP in 2008), to fill the gap in public finances.</p>
          <p>None the less, Latvia emerged from the recession with one of the fastest growing economies in the EU and there is no doubt that the post-1991 economic transition clearly resulted in its inhabitants enjoying living standards far higher than in the non-Baltic states of the former USSR. This reflected the country’s comparatively advantageous location close to Western Europe on the rim of the Baltic Sea, as well as its legacy, within living memory, of political independence and comparative economic success in 1918-40, both of which were used to shape the reform process. This essay will consider Latvia’s economic path from the USSR to the EU. First, it will consider the country’s economic inheritance from the USSR, and the major reforms undertaken after 1991. Second, it will discuss the macroeconomic and monetary reforms that, alongside the privatization programme of the mid- and late 1990s, created the framework for rapid economic expansion in the 21st century. Third, the character of the contemporary economy will be discussed. There is a particular focus on the banking sector, which emerged as the largest in the Baltic states, but experienced regular bank failures and courted controversy until the strengthening of oversight in 2018-20. Finally, the conclusion considers the causes of the 2008-10 economic crisis in Latvia and the controversy surrounding Latvia’s applicability as a model of austerity politics, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by the war in Ukraine, on the economy. </p>

          <heading>From Communism to Liberalism</heading>
          <p>As a constituent part of the USSR, the economy of the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic (SSR) was part of the wider command economy of the USSR. Latvia was entirely dependent on energy, raw materials and component parts from other areas of the Union, and the market for Latvian products was also overwhelmingly within the Union. At the same time, Latvia was one of the most industrially developed regions of the USSR. Latvian enterprises produced chemicals, pharmaceuticals, machinery, electronics and other relatively sophisticated products, and the Latvian SSR enjoyed a substantial trade surplus with the other 14 Union Republics. Latvia was the only Soviet producer of automatic telephone switchboards and passenger minibuses. However, there were substantial structural problems in terms of quality, efficiency and the sheer size of the enterprises, which employed significantly more staff, and provided many more additional services (such as nurseries, sports clubs and subsidized holidays), than their Western European counterparts.</p>
          <p>The marked economic decline and crisis of the Soviet economy in the late 1980s created a broad public and elite consensus on the need for extensive reform. It was the under-performing economy that prompted a large part of Latvia’s substantial Russian-speaking minority (accounting for almost one-half of the population in the 1980s) to support the initiative to break away from the USSR. Following independence in 1991, it was generally accepted that Latvia needed to adopt the laws and institutions of a market economy to support the new democratic order, provide a higher standard of living and ease Latvia’s integration with the West, and the EU in particular. Indeed, these reforms were started even before the collapse of the USSR as Latvia’s legislature renewed the mandate of the Bank of Latvia in 1990 and began working on reforms to encourage the growth of the public sector. Politicians initially promised that the transition would be cushioned by the creation of a Nordic social-economic model, maintaining a strong social safety net, generously financed education and health care, and other social benefits. At the outset of the radical reform process there was little understanding among Latvians (as well as international advisers and scholars) of the breadth and depth of the economic crisis to come. This led to great public disillusionment and distrust towards the political class when the post-independence recession proved far longer and deeper than expected.</p>
          <p>Independence brought new international borders and tariffs that disrupted both the flow of raw materials into Latvia, and the export of goods to the former markets in the east. All post-Soviet Latvian governments&#160;have prioritized integration with Western Europe above maintaining or deepening contacts with the east. At the same time, poor quality and outdated Latvian-manufactured products failed to find a market in the West. Thus, the first years of independence were fraught with economic decline and social crisis. Output fell dramatically, and the real value of pensions and other social benefits collapsed. The quality of public-sector services such as education and health care declined as financing was cut. There was a significant loss of faith in the market economy. Whereas the first post-Soviet election, in 1993, was won by Latvian nationalist and liberal free market parties, the 1995 election witnessed a dramatic rise in support for populist parties. Only political guile allowed a largely pro-market and pro-Western coalition to be formed.</p>
          <p>During the Soviet era Latvia experienced a large-scale inflow of Russian-speakers, primarily from Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. Indeed, the 1989 Soviet census revealed that ethnic Latvians made up just 52% of the population of the Latvian SSR. In a sense, this demographic situation has aided the transition process. The ethnic Latvian elite fractured into many small political parties. The one unifying factor that has prompted political cohesion has been concern over the loyalty of the Russian-speaking minority, and over Russia’s intentions as a neighbour (which has intensified since Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022). This led successive Latvian governments to focus on accession to the major European and international institutions—the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the EU, the Council of Europe, the World Trade Organization (WTO) and latterly the OECD—as a way of embedding itself within the international community. The accompanying economic and political conditionality of international integration largely shaped the liberal reform agenda of the 1990s and beyond.</p>

          <heading>Macroeconomic Stabilization</heading>
          <p>The macroeconomic environment in Latvia stabilized in the mid-1990s, as successive governments committed to liberalizing the economy according to advice from the IMF, the World Bank, the EU and other international organizations. Following a sharp contraction in the early 1990s, modest economic growth began in the second half of the decade (between 1995 and 2000 Latvian GDP increased by 25.6%, equivalent to an average annual rate of growth of 4.7%). This was succeeded by ever more spectacular growth in the first decade of the 2000s. Thus, the main macroeconomic reforms—price liberalization, budgetary restraint, monetary reform, tackling inflation and unemployment, as well as the creation of the main institutions of the market economy, reform of the tax regime, and privatization—were successfully undertaken in the 1990s.</p>
          <p>Price liberalization was completed relatively swiftly, despite virulent public opposition. State subsidies to industry and services were swiftly cut, and price controls lifted on virtually all goods and services by the end of 1992. The Bank of Latvia, led by its independent-minded Governor, Einārs Repše (a future Prime Minister), strictly limited currency emissions, while successive governments curbed public spending. The budget deficit has remained comparatively low, although economists and international organizations criticized the Government’s failure following EU accession to balance, or produce surplus, budgets in the years when annual GDP growth rates were around 10%. (In the years preceding the COVID-19 pandemic, governments were similarly criticized for failing to produce balanced budgets, despite more than nine years of steady growth; during the pandemic, the Government was criticized for not spending enough.) As a result, and in stark contrast to neighbouring Estonia, there were no reserves to draw on when Latvia entered a deep recession in late 2008, and the state was forced to request funding from international lenders to cover the budgetary shortfall, significantly raising the public debt burden from just 7.9% of GDP in 2007 to just under 40% of GDP in 2018. In recent years Latvia’s Fiscal Council has pressured the Government to plan for a budget surplus in order to create reserves for a `rainy day’ fund. In 2019 the budget deficit was just 0.5% of GDP, although in 2020 and 2021 the Government increased borrowing to fund emergency support measures implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, public debt has gradually shrunk in recent years and, according to Eurostat, at the end of 2022 the general government debt-to-GDP ratio was 39.9%, less than one-half the EU-27 average of 85.1%.</p>
          <p>The Bank of Latvia was established shortly before the fall of the communist regime. Its perceived success has been primarily attributed to stable leadership and political independence, although the detention of the Governor, Ilmārs Rimšēvičs, by anti-corruption investigators in early 2018 severely damaged the bank’s reputation. Rimšēvičs had been repeatedly elected to the post following the resignation of the first post-1991 Governor, Repše, in 2001, and had previously served as Deputy Governor for almost a decade. Although he was charged with bribery (and later additionally with money laundering), Rimšēvičs refused to resign from the post and remained as an ineffective Governor until the end of his term in December 2019. Parliament then elected Mārtiņš Kazāks, a respected economist (with a doctorate from the University of London in the United Kingdom), as Latvia’s third post-independence Governor. Rimšēvičs’s trial began in 2020 and was still ongoing in mid-2023. The central tenets of Latvian monetary policy were initially the introduction and maintenance of the national currency, the lats, and control of the money supply. Monetary policy then focused on preparing Latvia for admission to the eurozone in 2014, and latterly on formulating and implementing the Eurosystem’s monetary policy, together with the other central banks in the eurozone.</p>
          <p>A transitional currency, the Latvian ruble, was introduced in May 1992, followed by the lats in March 1993. The lats was `pegged’, or fixed, to the special drawing right accounting unit of the IMF. Following accession to the EU in May 2004, the lats was pegged to the European common currency, the euro, with effect from January 2005, at a rate of 0.703 lats to €1. The Bank maintained this exchange rate within a bracket of 1%. The Bank was forced to intervene in the money markets in early 2007, and then repeatedly in 2008 and 2009, in order to support the lats, amid rumours of currency devaluation. In mid-2012 the Government reduced both value-added tax (VAT) and the income tax rate, in a successful attempt to lower inflation and meet this part of the Maastricht criteria for admission to the eurozone, which took place on 1 January 2014.</p>
          <p>Inflation was high in the early years of independence, reaching an annual rate of over 200% in 1992, but then contracting to 34% in 1993 and 26% in 1994. Inflation was brought under control only after the 1995 banking crisis, when the collapse of Banka Baltija and other commercial banks significantly reduced the money supply. However, the inflation rate returned to political prominence in the mid-2000s, increasing to 6.2% in 2004 and, further, to 6.7% in 2005. The initial catalysts for the increase in inflation in the mid-2000s were unique factors related to EU accession, as well as to rising energy costs. However, inflation continued to climb as oil prices remained high, and rising wages, combined with the low cost of borrowing, strengthened high domestic demand. Eurostat (the EU statistical service) data for the first quarter of 2007 revealed that inflation in Latvia, measured on a year-on-year basis, was 8.9%, the highest in the EU. This had risen to 14.1% by December 2007, and continued to increase in the first half of 2008, before declining in the second half of the year as Latvian growth stalled and the economy slipped into recession. Inflation then continued to fall, to an average rate of 3.5% in 2009. The inflation rate remained at 3.3% in 2021. However, owing to rising energy prices and the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, inflation again became an issue of concern in 2022, with the inflation rate rising dramatically to 17.2% in that year, and the Bank of Latvia predicting rates of 8.5% in 2023 and 2.4% in 2024.</p>
          <p>The economic crisis of the 1990s inevitably led to a rise in unemployment as enterprises attempted to restructure, shedding excess staff in the process, or simply collapsing. Unemployment data for the 1990s have been unreliable, but it is clear that those hardest hit were industrial workers, those working in large enterprises and those living far from Rīga. The rate of unemployment only began to fall in the 2000s, from 14.4% in 2000 to 6.0% by the end of 2006, although the recession produced a sharp rise in unemployment, to 23% in the first quarter of 2010, the highest in the EU. By the end of that year the unemployment rate had declined to 17%, and it has more recently remained at around 7%, rising to only 8.1% in 2020, despite the pandemic (when many people in the hospitality and tourism sectors were placed on temporary leave rather than dismissed). Most of the long-term unemployed in Latvia are either close to the pension age (39% of those aged 50 and over were unemployed in 2022) and thus lacking the skills for employment in the modern market economy, or live in distant rural areas, especially the eastern region of Latgale (where the unemployment rate fell from 14.5% in 2021 to 9.0% in 2022, well above the national average of 6.9% and more than twice the 4.4% recorded in Rīga).</p>
          <p>The institutions of the market economy were created after independence. As a constituent republic of the USSR, Latvia did not have independent ministries of finance and economics. Moreover, the Soviet judiciary was highly politicized. There are essentially two dimensions to institutional construction. First, a framework of laws and structures needs to be created. Second, these institutions need to be brought to life by an adequately educated and trained staff. The latter is by far the more complicated and difficult task. Although all the major institutions of a market economy had been established by the late 1990s, public institutions continued to have problems recruiting, and retaining, skilled and educated staff. Low salaries and morale pushed many of the most able into the private sector, while corruption continued to taint the public sector. In May 2014 the Latvian anti-corruption bureau arrested the head of a public cemetery, indicating the extent to which corruption had seeped into all dimensions of the state. Although the rapid growth in GDP following Latvia’s accession to the EU resulted in sharply rising salaries in the public sector, the reductions in public spending, particularly in public sector salaries and benefits, carried out as part of the austerity programme in 2009 and 2010, reversed these gains. A planned reform of the civil service, including reductions in employees and a revised salary structure, has stalled in recent years.</p>
          <p>The tax collection regime has gradually become more efficient, and in 2019, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the tax revenue service continued a recent trend of collecting around 1% more than the target figure set in the government budget. Governments have progressively shifted to indirect taxation, with almost 40% of government tax revenue now originating from the 21% VAT rate that is imposed on a wide number of goods and services. Second, lower taxes, including a rate of corporate tax of 20% and a uniform rate of income tax, prompted more individuals and enterprises to declare their true earnings. It is hoped that a new zero tax rate on corporate profits that are reinvested, adopted as part of a wide-ranging tax reform at the beginning of 2018, will have a similar effect, although current data indicate that companies are holding on to earnings rather than investing them or paying out dividends. The 2018 tax reform also introduced a three-tier progressive tax rate aimed at easing growing economic inequality. Finally, in recent years the anti-corruption bureau has arrested and charged a number of prominent politicians and businessmen, prompting others to legalize their income and savings. Efforts against corruption were accelerated by new legislation that required all citizens and permanent residents to declare their financial holdings from January 2012 (providing evidence of all bank accounts, real estate, cash holdings and other investments).</p>
          <p>Privatization was a principal area of contention between Latvian corporate and political interests. Latvia’s political parties are largely privately funded and, until recently, there were few limits on party income and expenditure. As a result, parties have long been in thrall to business interests, and the introduction of state support for parties receiving over 3% in national elections has done little to reverse this trend. A large increase in state funding for parties, granted from 2020, is intended finally to cut the ties between party financing and corporate interests. Although the privatization of small enterprises was largely completed by 1995, the privatization of larger enterprises began only in 1994, following the establishment of the Latvian Privatization Agency, which controlled the sales process. By 2005 the private sector employed 75% of the workforce and contributed around 70% of GDP. Part of the gas monopoly, Latvijas Gāze, was sold in 2002, and in the following year stakes in the large shipping company Latvijas Kugniecība (LASCO), as well as the savings bank Latvijas Krājbanka, were also sold. The sale of the state’s remaining 39% stake in the oil transit firm Ventspils Nafta was completed in late 2006. Nevertheless, the state electricity company Latvenergo (with a 90% share of the electricity market) still awaited privatization, as did the Government’s remaining 51% stake in the profitable former telecommunications monopoly and its small stake in Latvia’s leading mobile telecommunications company, Latvijas Mobilais Telefons SIA. Latvia’s oldest commercial bank, Parex Banka, was nationalized in November 2008, after experiencing significant liquidity difficulties. Nevertheless, the Government swiftly demonstrated its intention to return Parex to the private sector, transferring majority ownership of the bank to the Latvian Privatization Agency in February 2009 and appointing a strategic adviser for its divestiture in March. In early 2010 the Government began to split Parex into two institutions—one with principal responsibility for the bank’s more hazardous loan portfolio, and the other for its safer loans—with the intention of eventually selling both banks to private investors. The safe loans bank was subsequently renamed Citadele Banka, and 25% of its shares were acquired by the UK-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The Government sold its 75% stake in the Citadele Banka to a group of US investors in 2014.</p>
          <p>Foreign investors were active in the early stages of privatization, culminating in inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) of US $521m. in 1997. FDI activity declined significantly at the end of the 1990s, but increased again in the period prior to Latvia’s accession to the EU, as fears of corruption, excessive bureaucracy and the unstable banking system were eased. FDI has largely been focused on the trade, transport, communications, retail and banking sectors. Initially, Germany was the most significant single investor; however, Sweden (accounting for 28.5%% of FDI stock in 2022), Estonia (12.9%), Lithuania (7.8%) and Russia (6.4%) have overtaken Germany (6.1%), primarily through purchases of Latvian commercial banks and other financial institutions, and telecommunications companies. These investments have been crucial in terms of bringing modern management expertise and technical innovation and with regard to integrating Latvia into European markets. By 2022 FDI stock in Latvia had grown to a high of €22,600m.</p>

          <heading>Sectors of the Economy</heading>
          <p>The nature and structure of the Latvian economy has changed radically since 1991. The shares of agriculture and industry in the economy have contracted, while the services sector has expanded. In addition, the large industrial manufacturing enterprises of the Soviet era have been largely replaced by smaller firms operating in the metal, timber and food processing industries.</p>
          <p>The agricultural sector has declined sharply in size and economic importance. Agricultural productivity in the Soviet era was low, and collective farms were inefficient and badly managed. Following independence, collectivized farms were broken up into small, mostly family farms and handed back to their pre-1940 owners. This resulted in an over-fragmentation of the farming sector. At the same time, the sector continued to suffer from structural problems of low productivity, aged equipment and a generally poor quality of soil. About one-third of agricultural land was taken out of production. The most significant declines in output occurred in animal and crop production, which contracted by a total of 66% and 32%, respectively, in 1990-99. The share of GDP provided by agriculture declined from around 25% in 1990 to only 5.8% in 2022, when 6.8% of the employed workforce was engaged in the sector. Accession to the EU encouraged the consolidation of farms, since new hygiene and inspection procedures proved extremely costly for smaller farmers. Moreover, the benefit payments system of the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy, which supported Latvia’s rural regions, is orientated towards larger, more commercial farms. Consolidation continued after EU accession, with rises in the average farm size. The 2020 agricultural census recorded 69,000 farms and smallholdings, less than one-half the number in the 2001 census. </p>
          <p>In addition to agriculture, wood processing and manufacturing are the main economic activities in Latvia’s rural regions. The export of wood products doubled between the mid-1990s and the mid-2000s, when it typically accounted for around one-quarter of all exports. However, despite government attempts to attract more value-added investment in the sector, and the success of a few niche furniture-makers in Western markets, growth slowed in the mid-2000s before picking up again in 2010. Nevertheless, much of the regional and structural funding that Latvia has received from the EU since 2004 has been directed towards the modernization of plants and machinery.</p>
          <p>The manufacturing sector accounted for 44% of Latvian GDP in 1991, but only 14.3% in 2022. The liberalization of trade led to the collapse of Latvia’s outdated manufacturing industries between 1991 and 1995. Nevertheless, some firms have maintained small markets in Russia and in other countries of the former USSR, although Latvia’s largest industrial enterprise, steel company Liepājas Metalurgs, declared bankruptcy in 2013 and, despite a financial bailout and privatization, again became insolvent and was dissolved in 2016.</p>
          <p>
      Construction accounted for 5.0% of GDP in 2022, but output in the sector is expected to rise over the following years due to the continued stimulus of EU structural funds, as well as the planned Rail Baltica project to connect the Baltic states and Central European railway networks. Construction had been marginalized in the 1990s, as declines in personal income and public investment led to a collapse in demand. However, the construction sector began to grow rapidly after 2002 (at an average annual rate of 15% until 2007), as the upturn in the economy led to a sharp increase in both personal income and government spending. Demand was initially limited to Rīga and the wealthy oil-transit town of Ventspils, but subsequently spread to other regions. However, the sector suffered acutely from the flight of Latvian labour to the UK and Ireland, after
      
       those markets were opened to Latvian citizens (and those of the other new member states of the EU) in 2004, leading to sharp rises in construction costs (particularly labour costs). Property prices increased by 65.9% in 2006. However, interest rates rose in 2007, the credit market tightened and demand slowed, with property prices subsequently stagnating and even falling in some regions. Property prices contracted by 60% in 2009, the largest decline worldwide, according to the 
      <i>Global Property Guide</i>
      ’s 2009 house price report, but rose steadily from 2011.
    </p>
          <p>Services experienced the most significant sectoral growth since 1991, and accounted for 70.5% of GDP in 2022, compared with just one-third of GDP in 1991. Initially, the greatest growth was in the financial services sector. The initial banking reforms of 1992 turned Rīga into an offshore services centre for Russian capital. One major bank advertised itself in Russia with the slogan `We are closer than Switzerland’. However, Latvia has also experienced a number of banking crises. The 1994-95 banking crisis saw Latvia’s largest bank, Banka Baltija, collapse, owing around US $400m. to more than 200,000 creditors (30% of all Latvian deposits were held in Banka Baltija). This led to a major restructuring of the banking sector, with 15 banks being closed during 1995 alone. Nevertheless, the Government bailed out Parex bank in 2008 (see above), and Latvia’s oldest commercial bank, Latvijas Krājbanka, with a 5.2% market share, was declared bankrupt in December 2011. One remaining concern has been the high number of non-resident deposits, primarily from Russian investors, in the smaller commercial Latvian banks. Indeed, in 2007, and again in 2016, the US Administration threatened a number of banks with commercial sanctions if they did not take measures to reduce their alleged attractiveness to those engaged in money laundering activities. The Latvian Government was obliged to increase its oversight of the financial sector as a condition of accession to the OECD in 2016. During the first months of the year the licence of one bank—Trasta Komercbanka—was revoked, while the Baltic International Bank and PrivatBank received substantial fines from the financial regulator for failing to follow procedures to combat money laundering. Of much greater significance was a February 2018 report by the US Treasury Department’s FinCEN, which accused ABLV Bank, the third largest bank in Latvia and the largest in the non-resident sector, of institutionalized money laundering, resulting in the suspension of ABLV’s access to the US banking system. Mass deposit withdrawals inevitably followed, and when the European Central Bank (ECB) imposed a block on payments, the owners announced that they would liquidate the bank. Subsequently, the Government announced that it would ban Latvia’s banks from servicing offshore `shell’ companies and that supervision of the sector would be improved. Non-resident banking has been a highly profitable part of Latvia’s finance sector, employing about 6,000 people and contributing about 2.2% of GDP in 2017. However, the sector contracted sharply in 2018, and by the end of that year non-resident deposits had fallen by 73%, from their peak in late 2015, to €3,300m. In 2019 the Latvian Government undertook an extensive reconstruction of the financial sector in order to avoid being the first EU member state to be placed on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) `grey list’ of countries for failing to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. In February 2020 the FATF decided that Latvia had succeeded in implementing all 40 of its recommendations and would not be included on the grey list. In 2022 the share of the financial intermediation sector was 3.2% of GDP.</p>
          <p>Lending rose sharply following Latvia’s accession to the EU. Loans to households and enterprises increased by 79% and 46%, respectively, in 2005. A combination of factors contributed to the rapid growth in financial services. First, steady economic growth led to a rise in real incomes. Second, low interest rates encouraged borrowing. Third, foreign ownership increased the capacity of banks to lend money. Fourth, strong growth in construction increased the supply of property on the market. All this resulted in an expansion of credit, particularly credit taken in foreign currencies (predominantly the euro). However, the 2008-10 recession led to both a dramatic slowdown in bank lending and a steady increase in loan payment defaults. Lending&#160;has increased since then, but banks are more cautious in providing large loans to enterprises and individuals. In 2015 Latvia’s commercial banks successfully campaigned for the Saeima (Parliament) to amend an insolvency law adopted in 2014, which&#160;had created a category of `non-recourse’ mortgages allowing borrowers to return real estate to the banks if they could no longer meet payments and also preventing the banks from pursuing other assets from borrowers. Banks&#160;eased restrictions on borrowing following Parliament’s concession.</p>
          <p>The Rīga Stock Exchange is a part of the NASDAQ OMX chain of bourses, as are several other stock exchanges in the region (Stockholm, Sweden; Helsinki, Finland; Tallinn, Estonia; and Vilnius, Lithuania). The volume of trading remains very small, and very few Latvian enterprises have chosen to be publicly listed.</p>
          <p>The tourism industry had been a major area of growth before the onset of the pandemic in 2020. The Government has long aimed to make Rīga airport the east-west hub of northern Europe. The airport enlarged its capacity through the construction of a new runway and terminal. Moreover, the privatized Latvian airline, airBaltic, significantly widened its scope of flights and destinations after EU accession, and a number of budget airlines, including Ryanair (of Ireland), which discussed opening a regional operations centre in Rīga (before settling on Kaunas in Lithuania), as well as smaller regional budget airlines, have also entered the Latvian aviation market. Rīga airport is the largest in the Baltic states, serving 5.4m. passengers in 2016 (compared with a total of 3.8m. for Lithuania’s Vilnius airport). These activities, in addition to accession to the EU, led to the rapid growth of the tourism sector. After a decline in 2009, tourist numbers rose sharply from 2010 onwards, as hotels and restaurants reduced their prices dramatically. The COVID-19 pandemic had a severe impact on this sector. In May 2020 the Government added €250m. to the share capital of airBaltic and introduced a number of support measures to assist the hospitality sector. Passenger numbers at Rīga airport in 2020 fell by two-thirds year-on-year, to just 1.4m., while the hotels and accommodation sector experienced a 53% decline in economic activity. There was a gradual return to normality in 2022, with overnight hotel bookings reaching 2016 levels.</p>

      Transport and communications have been greatly modernized, and the sector (including storage) contributed 13.0% of GDP in 2022. However, the transit sector has been affected by a boycott of the Latvian Ventspils pipeline by the Russian petroleum transportation company Transneft since January 2003, which has reduced oil transit through Ventspils by about two-thirds. Following the signing of a border treaty with Russia in March 2007, as well as the election of a Russian-speaking Mayor of Rīga, Latvia established a more pragmatic relationship with Russia, which emerged as Latvia’s largest trading partner after Estonia and Lithuania, although this did not lead to a renewal of oil shipments. The imposition of EU sanctions on Russia in 2014 and again, more comprehensively, in 2022 have had a negative impact on trade relations with Russia (see 
      <i>Conclusion</i>
      ), and the transport sector has experienced a sharp fall in the transit of goods from Russia.

          <p>Latvia’s geographical location, as well as its long-term commitment to free trade,&#160;has shaped its trade profile. A Baltic Free Trade Agreement, signed by the three Baltic states, entered into force in 1994; it initially excluded agricultural goods, although they too became subject to the terms of the agreement in 1997. The 1998 Russian economic crisis led to a brief period of increased agricultural protectionism in all three Baltic states, leading to minor conflicts over the import and export of pork and dairy products. However, all these conflicts disappeared after Latvia joined the WTO in January 1999 and the EU in May 2004. Nevertheless, a populist backlash against free trade and EU control of the agricultural sector emerged following the closure of Latvia’s last sugar-production facility in 2007, and support for protectionist measures grew as the recession deepened. However, the Government resisted pressure to impose new tariffs and trade restrictions.</p>
          <p>Trade grew rapidly in the years following independence, and government leaders successfully redirected trade from the markets of Russia and the CIS to Western markets. As a result, Latvia has two distinct trade markets. By the mid-2000s EU countries were Latvia’s most significant trading partners, importing wood and wood products, as well as textiles and foodstuffs. In addition to exporting low value-added products to the EU, Latvia has at least partly maintained, and recently expanded, activity in its markets to the east, where demand remains for some industrial goods, primarily machinery. There was a particularly sharp and continuing expansion of trade with neighbouring Lithuania and Estonia.</p>

          <heading>Conclusion</heading>
          <p>Three decades after independence, the Latvian economy has been substantially reformed and stabilized. Latvia returned to growth following the 2008-10 recession, which had obliged the Government to adopt a three-year IMF-approved stabilization programme funded by loans of €7,500m., and from 2011 experienced the fastest rate of GDP growth in the EU. This prompted a broad discussion on the applicability of Latvia’s austerity model to other crisis-stricken European states. Supporters of such an approach argued that by `front-loading’ fiscal adjustments and undertaking radical structural reforms, the Government quickly turned the economy around. Latvia is typically compared with Greece, which, in contrast with Latvia, was slow to introduce austerity measures and suffered a recession of more than six years. Other more left-wing economists have argued that Latvia should not be considered a success because of the steep decline in its GDP during the recession and continuing high unemployment, as well as the social costs of reductions in public spending and the impact of mass emigration. There was little discussion of austerity after the COVID-19 pandemic caused an economic slowdown during 2020 and 2021. The Government adopted a number of financial support measures for the individuals and businesses most severely affected by the crisis and in 2020 planned a wide-ranging economic stimulus package for the second half of the year. Austerity policies and balanced budgets were abandoned, although cautious political tendencies continued—Latvia’s Fiscal Discipline Council complained that the Government should be spending more to revive the economy. In 2021 the Government requested €1,800m. in grants from the EU’s new Recovery and Resilience Facility to accelerate recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic by modernizing, digitalizing and `greening’ Latvia’s economy.</p>
          <p>The war in Ukraine led to surging energy prices (costing Latvian companies and households an additional €1.7m. in 2022) and elevated inflation, cautious international investors, higher military spending and a growing number of Ukrainian refugees settling in Latvia (who numbered 36,000 in 2022). Although the level of Latvia’s exports to Russia remained virtually unchanged in 2022, the value of imports from Russia fell from 9.1% of GDP in 2021 to 6.9% of GDP (and exports to Belarus over the same period also declined). A ban on Russian natural gas and oil imports is expected to cause a further contraction in imports in 2023. Nevertheless, with Latvia’s membership of the EU, NATO and other Western institutions, and a recent tradition of effective macroeconomic supervision, the country’s long-term economic prospects remain good. </p>
