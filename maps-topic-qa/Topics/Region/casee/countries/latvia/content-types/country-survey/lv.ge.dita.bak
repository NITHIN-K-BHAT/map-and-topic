          <p id="LV.GEOG.1">The Republic of Latvia is situated in north-eastern Europe, on the east coast of the Baltic Sea. It is bounded by Estonia to the north and by Lithuania to the south and south-west. To the east there is a frontier with the Russian Federation and, to the south-east, with Belarus. Latvia covers an area of 64,573 sq&#160;km (24,932 sq&#160;miles). The present territory is essentially that of the pre-1940 republic, with the exception of the area around Pytalovo (Abrene, formerly Jaunlatgale), which was transferred to Russia in 1945.</p>
          <p id="LV.GEOG.2">The country is divided into the Coastal Lowlands and three main inland regions: Western Latvia, Central Latvia and Eastern Latvia. The Coastal Lowlands comprise the low-lying littoral of the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Rīga, along which there are several natural harbours. Western Latvia is also largely flat terrain, interrupted only by the undulating relief of the Western Kursa Upland. Central Latvia offers more varied terrain, ranging from the Zemgale plain in the south-west, part of which is below sea-level, to the Vidzeme Upland, a region of uneven relief, which includes the highest point in Latvia (Gaizinkalns, which stands at a height of 312&#160;m or 1,030&#160;ft). Eastern Latvia is dominated by the Latgale Upland, which extends to the south-eastern border with Belarus, and includes more than 1,000 lakes. Although there are more than 12,000 rivers in the country, the only major waterways are the Daugava (Dvina), which flows through the centre of the country and empties into the Gulf of Rīga, and the Gauja, which rises in the Vidzeme Upland.</p>

          <heading>Climate</heading>
          <p id="LV.GEOG.3">Owing to the influence of maritime factors, the climate is relatively temperate, but changeable. Average temperatures in January range from −2.8°C (26.6°F) in the western, coastal town of Liepāja to −6.6°C (20.1°F) in the inland town of Daugavpils. Mean temperatures for July range from 16.7°C (62.1°F) in Liepāja to 17.6°C (63.7°F) in Daugavpils. Average annual precipitation in Rīga is 617&#160;mm (24&#160;ins).</p>

          <heading>Population</heading>
          <p id="LV.GEOG.4">According to census results, the total population of Latvia numbered 1,893,223 at 1 January 2021, compared with 2,070,371 at the census held in 2011. According to official estimates, the total resident population numbered 1,883,008 at 1 January 2023, giving a population density of 29.2 per sq&#160;km. At 1 January 2023, according to official estimates, a total of 62.4% of the population were ethnic Latvians, 23.7% were Russians, 3.0% Belarusians, 3.0% Ukrainians, 1.9% Poles and 1.1% Lithuanians. The proportion of ethnic Latvians increased slightly after the restoration of independence in 1991, but remained considerably lower than the levels of the pre-Soviet period; in 1935 a total of 75.5% of the population were ethnic Latvians. Population distribution was quite uneven, with around 50% of the population living in the region around Rīga.</p>
          <p id="LV.GEOG.5">Latvian, an Indo-European language, a member of the Baltic group, written in the Latin script, is the official language. According to official statistics, at the end of 2017 Latvian was the first language of 60.8% of the Latvian population, compared with 58.2% at the census of 2000. Russian was the first language of 36.0% of the population, compared with 37.5% in 2000. The major religion is Christianity: most ethnic Latvians are traditionally Lutheran, although smaller Protestant sects have a considerable following among the younger generation, and the Roman Catholic Church is also represented. Adherents of the Eastern Orthodox Church in Latvia are mostly ethnic Russians.</p>
          <p id="LV.GEOG.6">
      The capital is Rīga, which is an important port, situated near the mouth of the River Daugava. Rīga had a population of 609,489 at 1 January 2023, according to official estimates. Other important cities include Daugavpils (with a population of 78,850), Liepāja (67,088) and Jelgava (
