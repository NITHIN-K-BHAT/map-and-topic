          <heading>Introduction</heading>
          <p>The wave of literacy and national self-determination that overtook Europe in the early 20th century and was compounded by the First Russian Revolution of 1905, the First World War, the Russian Revolution of 1917 and subsequent wars of independence led to the formation of the independent Latvian state in 1918, after centuries of imperial rule. The Constitution was ratified in 1922, and was notable for its relatively open stance toward minorities and focus on civic national identity. In 1934 Kārlis Ulmanis, Latvia’s President and so-called `benevolent’ dictator, followed the authoritarian trends overtaking Europe, turning from his previous commitment to democracy toward populism-style agrarian nationalism, suspending the Constitution and increasing state control of the press and the economy.</p>
          <p>Although it declared neutrality at the start of the Second World War, Latvia was in a precarious position between Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia. On 23 August 1939 the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and Nazi Germany signed the Treaty of Non-Aggression (or Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact), which included secret protocols bringing the Baltic states into the Soviet sphere of influence. Latvia succumbed to pressure to sign a Treaty of Mutual Assistance with the USSR in October. The Baltic states became battle grounds, occupied first by Soviet Russia in 1940, then Nazi Germany in 1941 and again by the USSR in 1944. Over the course of these occupations, Latvia’s population was devastated by Soviet deportations, the repatriation of the Baltic German community, the annihilation of the Jewish ethnic minority, and a wave of refugees escaping to the West—a total of more than 250,000 people were lost. The effect on the populace was deep trauma, which was subsequently enhanced and repressed in the more than four decades of Soviet occupation that followed.</p>
          <p>The Latvian movement seeking the restoration of independence from the USSR was catalysed by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev’s policies of glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring) and found opportunity for opposition to Soviet power through environmental protests. The movement, later characterized as the Baltic Singing Revolution for the regional non-violent application of folk culture and identity in advocating for political rights, succeeded in coalescing around the Latvijas Tautas Fronte (LTF—Latvian Popular Front), similar to the Eestimaa Rahvarinne (Popular Front of Estonia) and the Sąjūdis (Lithuanian Movement for Reconstruction).</p>
          <p>The first multi-party elections for the Supreme Soviet (Supreme Council—legislature) of the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic (SSR) began in March 1990, in which the pro-independence LTF gained a strong position within the governing body. On 4 May the Supreme Soviet approved the Declaration on the Restoration of Independence, which stated that Latvia had retained de jure sovereignty, despite its de facto and illegal annexation into the USSR. The decision annulled Latvia’s July 1940 accession to the USSR and reinstituted the 1922 Constitution, beginning a transitional period towards de facto independence. Multiple attempts were made to destabilize the transitional Government, but the Supreme Council of Latvia claimed full independence on 21 August 1991, after adopting a constitutional act on the country’s status. Russia under President Boris Yeltsin recognized Latvia’s independence on 24 August, followed by the USSR on 6 September. On 17 September Latvia, along with Lithuania and Estonia, became members of the United Nations (UN).</p>

          <heading>Latvia’s Constitutional Structure</heading>
          <p>Latvia’s Constitution provides for a democratic republic in which the people are represented by the 100-member unicameral Saeima (Parliament), to which members are elected by proportional representation for a four-year term. Parties must achieve a 5% threshold to be represented in Parliament. In parliamentary elections, voters may select one party’s list, and specific candidates from that list. The country comprises five regional constituencies—Rīga (the capital), Vidzeme, Latgale, Kurzeme and Zemgale—in which candidates must choose to stand. On 17 December 2020 Parliament amended electoral legislation to allow citizens abroad to vote in municipal elections by mail. The Chairperson (speaker) of Parliament is a deputy, who is elected by other members of the body. If the President is unable to fulfil their duties, the speaker temporarily assumes the office.</p>
          <p>The head of government is the Prime Minister, who is nominated by the President for approval by Parliament. The Prime Minister is traditionally from the party that is most able to form a coalition government, as the multi-party parliamentary system does not usually allow a party to hold a ruling majority. The Prime Minister is responsible for proposing a cabinet of ministers, which is then submitted to a confidence vote in Parliament.</p>
          <p>The Head of State is the President, who is elected by Parliament for a term of four years, with a limit of two consecutive terms. As Head of State, the President represents the country in international forums, appoints and receives diplomatic representatives and acts as the Commander-in-Chief of the National Armed Forces, which allows the President to take defensive action. The President is able to initiate or veto legislation and call for referendums, and may propose the dissolution of Parliament.</p>
          <p>Latvia’s political landscape since the restoration of independence can be briefly characterized as complex stability. While the political structure allows for the relatively straightforward creation and dissolution of political parties, significant political players have largely retained their influence, realigning or reforming political parties as the situation demands. This has also left room for corruption scandals, which have been a feature of Latvia’s politics and a source of frustration for the electorate, although the most corrupt parties have been consistently voted out of power.</p>
          <p>The dominance of a pro-Western political orientation, though occasionally challenged by Euroscepticism, has never been effectively opposed. Early on after the restoration of independence, Latvia pursued close co-operation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), participating in the North Atlantic Co-operation Council from 1991, and joining its `Partnership for Peace’ programme in 1994. This early co-operation between NATO and the Latvian National Armed Forces facilitated compliance with NATO requirements as Latvia developed its defence system. Latvian troops also participated in NATO operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1996. In April 1999 NATO invited Latvia, along with eight other candidate states, to present a Member Action Plan, and in November 2002 Latvia and six other states were invited to join the Alliance. Latvia officially became a NATO member state on 29 March 2004.</p>
          <p>Provocations by the Russian Federation have been a consistent factor with which Latvia has had to contend, for example, in the form of airspace incursions, but also with respect to hybrid and cyber warfare and considerable influence in the energy and media space. This has traditionally pushed Latvia’s politics toward ethnic rather than ideological alignments—which has also left society vulnerable to destabilization efforts by Russia. However, there have been indications of a shift in this trend, which was also affected by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 (see below). </p>
          <p>European elections have also seen the influence of ethnicity and identity politics. Notably, some candidates who are barred from seeking office in Latvia due to links with the former Latvijas Komunistiskā Partija (Communist Party of Latvia) or Soviet state security services have secured election in the European Parliament, often campaigning on Eurosceptic platforms.</p>
          <p>Ideological diversity within the coalition Government is not uncharacteristic of Latvian politics. This may contribute to the low trust that Latvians have in political parties—a broad governing coalition requires significant compromise rather than ideological purity. However, the multi-party system and comparative difficulty of establishing single-party rule may also contribute to Latvia’s ability to avoid democratic backsliding, which has been experienced in some of the country’s regional neighbours. </p>
          <p>Although the Latvian political landscape since the re-establishment of independence may initially appear somewhat chaotic with regard to the creation and dissolution of political parties, there is relative continuity in many of the major players and in the largely unwavering pro-democratic, pro-Western orientation of the state.</p>

          <heading>The Fifth Parliament</heading>
          <p>The first democratic elections to Parliament after the restoration of independence were held on 5 and 6 June 1993, with 89.9% of eligible voters participating. Of the 23 parties seeking representation in the fifth Parliament (a designation that continued from the parliaments of the inter-war period), eight passed the threshold for representation. Fifteen of the 100 elected deputies were women. Major issues included citizenship legislation, corruption legislation, territorial reform and the removal of Russian troops from Latvian territory. Ivars Godmanis, a member of the LTF who had served as Prime Minister from 1990, was succeeded by Valdis Birkavs of the newly formed Latvijas Ceļš (LC—Latvian Way) in August 1993. Birkavs was replaced by Māris Gailis, also of LC, in September 1994.</p>

          <heading>The Presidency of Guntis Ulmanis, 1993-99</heading>
          <p>Guntis Ulmanis, who was the grand-nephew of former inter-war President Kārlis Ulmanis and had been deported to Siberia during Soviet occupation, entered Parliament as a member of the Latvijas Zemnieku Savienība (LZS—Latvian Farmers’ Union) in the 1993 elections, and was elected to the presidency on 7 July. He presided over an agreement on the withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia, which was concluded in 1994. Integration into international organizations was a priority during Ulmanis’s presidency, with the submission of Latvia’s formal application for EU membership in 1995. Ulmanis called on the international community to condemn the Soviet regime. He was re-elected President by Parliament on 18 June 1996.</p>
          <p>Ulmanis presided over key changes to citizenship legislation during his tenure. When independence was re-established in 1991, Latvia utilized the doctrine of continuity to establish citizenship on the basis of the inter-war state. This was intended to preserve an ethnic Latvian majority citizenship after an influx of Soviet migrants and russification policies significantly altered the country’s ethnic demographics between the inter-war and post-Soviet periods. (Under the 1949 Geneva Convention, the transfer of civilians from the territory of the occupation force to occupied territory is prohibited.) Automatic citizenship was granted to those who had been citizens of inter-war Latvia and their descendants (regardless of ethnicity). Around 25% of the population were granted `non-citizenship’, a permanent resident status that provided post-Soviet citizens who were not eligible for automatic citizenship many of the same rights and protections, excluding the right to vote and serve in the civil service, or posts related to national security. Latvian elites initially hoped that comparatively strict laws would encourage the repatriation of Soviet-era migrants to Russia. However, a comparatively large non-citizen population remained. Non-citizenship status has been criticized by the West and Russia, and has contributed to endemic problems with the civic integration of some Russian-speakers.</p>
          <p>In 1994 the fifth Parliament adopted the Law on Citizenship, which contained strict naturalization quotas designed to maintain a Latvian majority. Under pressure from the international community, Ulmanis rejected this numerical quota, opting for an amended version of the citizenship law in 1994, which included `naturalization windows’ that staggered naturalization eligibility according to age-group. However, there was relatively low interest in naturalizing during 1995-98, as a result of various factors including language requirements, dissatisfaction with the naturalization process, unwillingness to serve in the military (conscription was in force until 2007), relative complacency with the rights and benefits of non-citizenship and other identity factors.</p>
          <p>The Citizenship Law was amended significantly in 1998, again under international pressure as Latvia aimed to join the EU. The system of `naturalization windows’ was abolished, and a bureaucratic, but more accessible, path to citizenship was established for children born in Latvia to non-citizen or stateless parents. The 1998 law was called into question on grounds of being overly restrictive, particularly in its stance towards non-citizen naturalization (which required Latvian language and civic tests, as well as an oath of loyalty). However, the Latvian law on citizenship was on a par with other policies across Europe, and allowed Latvia to pursue its primary political goals of reintegration with the West.</p>

          <heading>The Sixth Parliament</heading>
          <p>The sixth Parliament was elected on 30 September and 1 October 1995, with the participation of 71.9% of eligible voters. Nine candidate lists of a total of 19 met the 5% threshold for parliamentary representation; eight of the 100 deputies elected were women. The political factions in the sixth Parliament were in a state of constant flux as parties dissolved and reformed. During this term, Parliament worked on citizenship reform and made amendments to the Constitution, including on electoral and parliamentary procedures, as well as human rights. As political parties struggled to form a coalition, popular politician Andris Šķēle—an oligarch later mired in corruption scandals—was presented as an independent candidate for Prime Minister in December 1995. Šķēle offered his resignation in January 1997, after his Government lost support in Parliament. He was invited to form the next Government, which took office in February; however, he was finally forced to resign and was succeeded in August by Guntars Krasts of the Tēvzemei un Brīvībai/Latvijas Nacionālās Neatkarības Kustība (TB/LNNK—For Fatherland and Freedom Union/Latvian National Conservative Party). Under Šķēle’s leadership, the Government focused on wide-scale privatization and land ownership policies.</p>

          <p>For the first time, in accordance with the newly enacted constitutional amendments, the elections for the seventh Parliament were conducted on a single day, 3 October 1998. Of 21 party lists, six entered Parliament, with 71.9% of the electorate participating; 17 seats were secured by women. The Tautas Partija (TP—People’s Party), which had been formed by Šķēle after he resigned the premiership, won 24 parliamentary seats, but was left in opposition. Vilis Krištopans of LC headed the Government as Prime Minister from November. Šķēle was again nominated to serve as Prime Minister in July 1999, after the resignation of Krištopans’s Government. He was succeeded in 2000 by Andris Bērziņš of LC. During the term of the seventh Parliament, further changes to the Constitution, as well as to laws on state administration and commerce, and revisions to the criminal code were made. Internationally, the Government worked toward achieving NATO and European Union (EU) accession.</p>

          <heading>The Presidency of Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga, 1999-2007</heading>
          <p>Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga, an independent without party affiliation who was the first woman to be democratically elected as President in Latvia, and indeed Eastern Europe, assumed the office on 8 July 1999. Vīķe-Freiberga was an émigré, whose family had fled from Latvia during the Second World War, before moving to Morocco and finally settling in Canada, where she became a notable scholar of psychology and folklore. This Western experience was regarded as a valuable contribution during Latvia’s transitional years, as she brought with her first-hand knowledge of democracy and market economies, and of Western languages. Her presidency is largely credited with facilitating Latvia’s admission to the EU and NATO. She supported US President George W. Bush in the US-led war in Iraq beginning in 2003, which drew criticism from within Europe, but favour in the USA. Sometimes referred to as the Baltic `Iron Lady’, she was also listed as a potential candidate of the Baltic states for the role of Secretary-General of the UN in 2006.</p>

          <heading>The Eighth Parliament</heading>
          <p>The elections to the eighth Parliament took place on 5 October 2002; 71.5% of eligible voters participated, electing six of 20 candidate lists to Parliament, among them 18 women. Einārs Repše, a member of the Jaunais Laiks (JL—New Era) party, became Prime Minister in 2002. Repše had gained popularity as Governor of the central bank for overseeing the transition to the lats as Latvia’s national currency. He resigned as Prime Minister following the withdrawal of the Latvijas Pirmā Partija (LPP—Latvian First Party) from the governing coalition in early 2004. Repše was subsequently investigated by the anti-corruption bureau for questionable real estate transactions; although no wrongdoing was discovered, he lost considerable popular support. From March Indulis Emsis of the Zaļo un Zemnieku Savienība (ZZS—Greens’ and Farmers’ Union—an alliance led by the LZS) headed a minority Government, which was most probably approved to avoid lengthy coalition negotiations during Latvia’s historic accession process to NATO and the EU. Aigars Kalvītis of the TP took over as Prime Minister in December. During the eighth Parliament, legislation on associations and foundations, real estate privatization and criminal processes was addressed, as were convergence criteria for accession to the EU. After a vote in favour of membership in a national referendum in September 2003, Latvia joined the EU in May 2004, together with Estonia, Lithuania and seven other states. It joined the EU’s Schengen area of free movement without border controls in 2007.</p>

          <p>On 7 October 2006 the elections to the ninth Parliament took place, with a voter turnout of 61.0%. Seven of the 19 candidate lists secured representation in Parliament, of which 19 elected deputies were women. The governing coalition led by Kalvītis retained power in the elections. Some party realignment subsequently took place, including the formation of the Nacionālā Apvienība (NA—National Alliance) coalition between the nationalist Visu Latvijai! (All For Latvia!) and the TB/LNNK. The ninth Parliament ratified two important international agreements—a border agreement reached with Russia and the EU’s Treaty of Lisbon. A constitutional provision allowing the Cabinet of Ministers to issue regulations with legislative power (with some limits) between parliamentary sessions in case of urgent necessity was removed from the Constitution.</p>

          <heading>The Presidency of Valdis Zatlers, 2007-11</heading>
          <p>Valdis Zatlers, previously an orthopaedic surgeon, assumed the presidency in July 2007. An independent, his candidacy had been promoted by a four-party coalition. Zatlers was Head of State during the severe economic crisis that began in 2008, with the task of managing domestic political stability and Latvia’s international reputation, including the development of export markets and the improvement of relations with Russia under President Dmitrii Medvedev. Zatlers also advocated the direct election of the presidency to counter the trading of presidential nominations between political parties, but was unsuccessful in this aim.</p>
          <p>Zatlers was the subject of some controversy over accepting `donations’ from patients during his work as a physician—a relatively common practice among doctors. The Anti-Corruption Bureau cleared him of any illegal practices, although the State Revenue Service issued a fine of 250 lats (about US&#160;$500) against him for failing to declare the donations. </p>
          <p>Zatlers nominated Latvia’s first post-Soviet premier Godmanis, by this time a member of a reconstituted alliance between the LPP and LC, as Prime Minister in December 2007. Godmanis’s Government collapsed following corruption allegations and the impact of the 2008 international financial crisis, which was more severe in Latvia than in any other Eastern European country. On 20 February 2009 he tendered the resignation of his Government, following protests and rioting over its management of the crisis. Valdis Dombrovskis of JL succeeded him as Prime Minister.</p>
          <p>Between 2008 and 2010 Latvia lost approximately 25% of its gross domestic product (GDP), partially a result of government spending initiatives and its overheated economy prior to the crisis. The International Monetary Fund approved a €1,680m. rescue package in December 2008, which, together with EU assistance, supported a programme of stabilization and austerity measures, under the leadership of Dombrovskis. The measures increased public hardship, and a significant proportion of Latvia’s population emigrated. The demographic consequences—particularly in rural regions—were considerable. Economically, by 2010 the country had returned to a state of economic growth and Dombrovskis’s Government was re-elected.</p>

          <heading>The 10th Parliament</heading>
          <p>On 2 October 2010 the elections to the 10th Parliament took place, with 63.1% of the electorate voting. Five of 13 candidate lists secured representation, including 19 women. Issues taken up by the 10th Parliament included changes to the laws on higher education, forestry, criminality and judicial power, the code of commerce, party financing and changes to parliamentary regulations.</p>
          <p>Just prior to the 2011 presidential election, Zatlers called a referendum on the dissolution of Parliament, accusing its members of weakness in addressing corruption after it had prevented the Anti-Corruption Bureau from searching the properties of Ainārs Šlesers, a prominent deputy and oligarch. Šlesers had been under investigation for various corruption charges, including money laundering and abuse of office. The national referendum took place on 23 July, when 94.3% of votes supported the dissolution of Parliament, with 44.7% of eligible voters participating. In the following early parliamentary elections, Šlesers’s party, the LPP/LC, failed to win a single seat. Zatlers’s move undermined his own attempt to secure a second presidential term, but he retained political influence by creating the Zatlers Reformu Partija (ZRP—Zatlers’s Reform Party), which, he announced, would not co-operate with the parties associated with Latvia’s `three oligarchs’—Šlesers, Aivars Lembergs of the ZZS and Šķēle of the TP (which also failed to secure any seats). The three were subject to repeated scrutiny over allegations of corruption.</p>

          <p>The 10th Parliament, which had been dissolved by President Zatlers, was none the less the body to decide the 2011 presidential election. Shortly before the election wealthy banker Andris Bērziņš was nominated by the ZZS, a paradoxically conservative party with strong links to Lembergs. Bērziņš won a second-round vote against popular incumbent Zatlers, who had gained strong public approval for his tough stance against corruption. While Bērziņš’s candidacy was not particularly out of line with the party-centric role in presidential elections, his lack of presidential persona and limited English language skills made him an unexpected choice to take the part of Head of State on an international stage. Some of the more significant legislative initiatives that Bērziņš submitted to Parliament concerned the strengthening of executive power and political parties. He also donated his presidential salary to rural schools in an effort to stem migration from the countryside. Bērziņš did not seek a second term.</p>

          <heading>The 11th Parliament</heading>
          <p>Early elections were held on 17 September 2011, after the July referendum scheduled by former President Zatlers on the dissolution of Parliament. The term of the 11th Parliament was three years, rather than four, due to the results of the referendum. Voter turnout at the elections was 59.5%, and 21 of the elected deputies were women. Of 13 candidate lists, five parties or party coalitions passed the 5% threshold to gain representation in Parliament: the Saskaņas Centrs (SC—Harmony Centre) alliance of left-wing parties (with 31 seats), the ZRP (22 seats), Vienotība (Unity—which included JL—20 seats), the NA (14 seats) and the ZZS (13 seats). Given SC’s strong performance, the party (which largely catered to Russian-speakers) was seriously considered for inclusion in the governing coalition, but ultimately Vienotība, the ZRP and the nationalist NA formed the new Government, which was again under the premiership of Dombrovskis. The NA subsequently withdrew from the coalition, leaving a minority Government. Despite failing to secure re-election as President, Zatlers maintained his political influence in Parliament. Edgars Rinkēvičs (initially independent, later a member of the ZRP) began his tenure as Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>
          <p>The polarization of ethnic discourse played out on a large scale in February 2012, when pro-Russia activists initiated a referendum in favour of adopting Russian as a second official national language. This was largely in response to a failed attempt by the NA for a referendum proposing that all state-financed schools instruct only in the Latvian language. Only six municipalities of 110 and the city of Daugavpils voted with a slight majority to adopt Russian as a second official language, and the overwhelming defeat of the referendum on elevating the status of Russian language in Latvia served as a defining moment in the integration discussion, as it reinforced the broadly popular opinion that the Latvian language has primacy in the country.</p>
          <p>After significant outward migration following EU accession and the 2008 financial crisis, in 2013 Latvian citizenship legislation was amended significantly. Changes were made to retain diaspora citizens (through dual citizenship), simplify the process of naturalization, as well as automatically provide the option of citizenship to children born in Latvia to stateless or non-citizen parents. These amendments encouraged domestic integration, but also underlined the strong priority of integrating with the West. The 2013 amendments featured a dual citizenship provision with EU and NATO members, Australia, Brazil and New Zealand, but significantly did not include Russia or members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (i.e. non-EU post-Soviet countries).</p>

          <heading>The End of the Dombrovskis Government</heading>
          <p>The collapse of a shopping centre building in the Zolitūde district of Rīga in November 2013, in which 54 people died, left a lasting mark on the Latvian political landscape. Poor regulation contributed to the tragedy, and the parliamentary investigation named several prominent politicians considered responsible for the collapse, including Prime Minister Dombrovskis and the Mayor of Rīga, Nils Ušakovs of the Saskaņa Sociāldemokrātiskā Partija (Saskaņa—Harmony Social Democratic Party); Dombrovskis resigned as Prime Minister on 27 November following the tragedy, but remained in office in an interim capacity until 22 January 2014. There was speculation that the ZZS had demanded his resignation in order to vie for a place in the governing coalition. Dombrovskis then turned to European politics, briefly pursuing the presidency of the European Commission, but serving as its Vice-President for the Euro and Social Dialogue from November 2014, and in 2016 assuming responsibility for the financial services portfolio. In December 2019 he became Executive Vice-President of the European Commission for An Economy that Works for People.</p>
          <p>Despite the economic impact of the international financial crisis, the austerity measures introduced by the Dombrovskis Government and the economic recovery that followed put Latvia on track to join the eurozone. After meeting the convergence criteria of the Treaty on European Union (the Maastricht Treaty) in June 2013, Latvia adopted the common European currency on 1 January 2014, replacing the lats with the euro. Although not without controversy, joining the single currency was a significant move towards deeper EU integration, which was not only a fiscal but also a security priority for further integration with Western institutions. Adoption of the euro also highlighted Latvia’s fiscal recovery, as one of the fastest-growing economies to emerge from the devastating 2008 crisis.</p>

          <p>On 19 June 2014 Parliament approved at the final reading the addition of a preamble to the Latvian Constitution. Drafted by Egils Levits (see below), a Latvian judge at the European Court of Justice (ECJ), the preamble firmly established the immutable role of Latvian culture and language to the state, and made historic references to the establishment and restoration of independence. The addition of the introductory provisions caused some controversy. Supporters maintained that the inclusion of the preamble was a much-needed revision to the document and outlined the reason for the existence of the state, while those opposed, notably the pro-Russia Saskaņa, considered it to be exclusionary and argued that it contradicted broader references to the people of Latvia in the document by elevating the status of ethnic Latvians. Others argued that the change was a populist move in advance of the 2014 parliamentary elections.</p>

          <heading>The 12th Parliament</heading>
          <p>The elections to the 12th Parliament were held 4 October 2014, when six parties reached the 5% threshold and secured representation; the voter turnout was 58.9%. Saskaņa won the highest number of seats (24), followed by the centre-right Vienotība (23 seats), the oligarch-linked centrist ZZS (21 seats), the right-wing NA (17 seats), the newly formed centrist Latvijas Re&#291;ionu Apvienība (LRA—Latvian Association of Regions, eight seats), and conservative No Sirds Latvijai (For Latvia from the Heart, seven seats). Ināra Mūrniece of the NA was elected as Chairwoman of Parliament on 4 November. Concerns over Russian military intervention in Ukraine (following its annexation of the Crimean peninsula in March 2014) dominated the 2014 elections and the political orientation of the governing coalition. Vienotība, the ZZS and the NA formed a new Government, approved by Parliament on 5 November, with Straujuma of Vienotība remaining as Prime Minister. Soon after the formation of the cabinet, in which Edgars Rinkēvičs (by then of Vienotība) retained his position as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Rinkēvičs publicly announced his homosexuality via social network Twitter and advocated for same sex rights. Rinkēvičs was the most prominent politician in the former Soviet bloc to make such a move—lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights are still challenged in broadly socially conservative Latvia.</p>
          <p>The Straujuma Government focused significantly on security concerns, increasing defence spending and seeking a larger NATO presence in the Baltic region, along with its counterparts in Estonia and Lithuania. Russia’s support for separatists in eastern Ukraine and its annexation of Crimea had ramifications for Latvian politics, as Latvia was widely considered to represent one of the possible `next’ targets for Russia’s territorial expansion, given the large Russian-speaking population. This prompted concerns over NATO deterrence and the Alliance’s principle of collective defence. In September 2014 US President Barack Obama visited Estonia to confirm NATO’s commitment to the Baltic countries. In November 2015 NATO’s Allied Rapid Reaction Corps trained for the first time in the Baltic states. At the 2016 summit in Warsaw, Poland, the decision was taken to establish NATO’s forward presence in the Baltic countries with four multinational battalion-sized battle groups stationed, respectively, in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland on a rotational basis. In 2018 Latvia met the NATO guideline for defence spending, of 2% of GDP, a level that is not achieved by most other NATO signatories.</p>
          <p>From 2015 the EU faced a test of member solidarity and co-operative regulations during an escalating refugee crisis. Latvia adopted its first asylum law in 1997, but until the 2010s the number of asylum requests in Latvia remained relatively low and refugee countries of origin corresponded with regional crises (primarily arriving from Georgia and Ukraine). Although Latvia is on the EU border and a transit country for irregular migrants seeking to reach Europe by land, it is rarely a destination country for asylum seekers and migrants, due to limited social benefits, economic opportunities and integration mechanisms. When more than 1m. refugees crossed into Europe in 2015, the EU failed to manage effectively the increase in asylum applications. The EU Relocation Programme, which implemented relocation quotas to ease the pressure on frontline receiving states—namely Greece and Italy—was met with polarizing resistance in Latvia. The issue caused fractures within the coalition Government as the NA adopted a virulent xenophobic and anti-refugee position, arguing the state should be focused on the welfare of its own citizens and exacerbating already existing concerns over limited social welfare benefits and national identity. The debate over refugees crossed the usual ethnic cleavage that has been a dominant factor in modern Latvian politics, uniting perhaps unlikely allies in the NA and Saskaņa parties (both of which have exhibited Eurosceptic and social conservative tendencies). However, the substantial controversy, which was manipulated to aggravate existing cleavages in society, was focused around a remarkably small number of people seeking asylum. Parliament did ultimately prioritize European solidarity in September, agreeing to accept 531 asylum seekers over two years. In December the Cabinet of Ministers issued the Action Plan for Movement and Admission in Latvia of Persons who Need International Protection, and the programme concluded in 2018. The country had accepted only 374 applicants from southern Europe since 2015, and many had since left the country. Latvia continued to accept asylum applicants based on bilateral agreements. The political will to craft more than baseline institutional support for asylum seekers and refugee integration has been limited; however, the war in Ukraine from February 2022 has precipitated notable changes (see below).</p>
          <p>On 7 December 2015 Prime Minister Straujuma announced the resignation of her Government, citing the need for new ideas. Infighting within the governing coalition, including tensions within her own Vienotība, had precipitated Straujuma’s resignation. There was speculation that a former Chairwoman of Parliament, Solvita Āboliņa (also of Vienotība), was seeking the post of Prime Minister and had called for Straujuma to resign over an investment scandal concerning national air carrier airBaltic, and the EU refugee allocation plan. Straujuma supported the candidacy of Rihards Kozlovskis, then Minister of the Interior, for the premiership. However, Māris Kučinskis of the ZZS was eventually invited to form the government.</p>
          <p>With the ruling coalition unchanged, the Kučinskis Government, which took office in February 2016, largely followed the policies of the Straujuma administration, including work to strengthen the economy and national defence. The pro-Western orientation remained stable, with Minister of Foreign Affairs Rinkēvičs remaining at the helm of diplomatic relations. However, Kučinskis faced a difficult balancing act within the coalition Government regarding the European refugee crisis, as the pro-refugee stance of Vienotība clashed with that of the nationalist NA.</p>

          <heading>The Presidency of Raimonds Vējonis, 2015-19</heading>
          <p>Former Minister of Defence Raimonds Vējonis of the centre-right Latvijas Zaļā Partija/ZZS (Latvian Green Party) was elected to the presidency in the fifth round of voting on 3 June 2015, with the support of 55 deputies. He assumed office on 8 July. Vējonis had previously served as a deputy in the ninth, 10th and 11th Parliaments, and as Minister of Environmental Protection and Regional Development. During his presidency, Vējonis called on Parliament to consider expanding the powers of the President and Prime Minister, and unsuccessfully proposed the election of the President by popular vote. As Minister of Defence, Vējonis had prioritized Latvian defence capabilities within the NATO framework, and it was during his presidency that Latvia achieved the requisite 2% of GDP in its defence-related spending. National security was a priority for the Vējonis presidency, as was a focus on domestic stability.</p>
          <p>A legacy of the Vējonis presidency has been the elimination of non-citizenship status for children born in Latvia to non-citizen parents. The bill, which was proposed by President Vējonis and rejected by Parliament, was eventually passed following his tenure by the 13th Parliament in October 2019, supported by both coalition and opposition deputies, excluding NA members. It entered into effect from 1 January 2020. The change impacted only a very small number of children, as citizenship laws had already provided for opt-in citizenship. Nevertheless, the decision was notably symbolic, as the non-citizen question has long been a domestic policy issue that has affected Latvia on the world stage.</p>

          <heading>The 13th Parliament</heading>
          <p>The 13th Parliament was elected on 6 October 2018, with a voter turnout of 54.6%. A record 31 of the 100 seats were secured by women, just above the EU average and well above the world average for democratically elected legislatures. Notable for socially conservative Latvia was the election of two openly gay politicians, longstanding Minister of Foreign Affairs Rinkēvičs (see above) and Marija Golubeva, the first openly gay woman to be elected.</p>
          <p>Saskaņa won the highest number of seats (23), but was unable to form a governing coalition. Kam Pieder Valsts? (KPV LV—Who Owns the State?), a new, populist party, secured 16 seats in Parliament in its first electoral contest. The party, which had been launched in 2016 by actor and activist Artuss Kaimiņš, rose to prominence denouncing the media and verbally attacking establishment forces in government, while drawing on economic grievances and political frustrations. The Jaunā Konservatīvā Partija (JKP—New Conservative Party) also won 16 seats, while the nationalist NA and the Attīstībai/Par! (Development/For!) alliance, led by the newly formed, liberal Kustība Par! (Movement For!), each received 13 seats. The ZZS lost 10 of the 21 seats that it had won in the previous elections.</p>
          <p>Jaunā Vienotība (New Unity), an electoral alliance formed from the Vienotība party, which had been plagued by infighting, survived a decline in popularity but won just eight seats. Nevertheless, after four months of negotiations, Jaunā Vienotība emerged as the leader of a governing coalition, with party member (Arturs) Krišjānis Kariņš as Prime Minister; the Government took office on 23 January 2019. US-born Kariņš had previously been a Member of the European Parliament, and served as Latvian Minister of Economics in 2004-06.</p>
          <p>The five-party coalition, which predictably excluded Saskaņa, comprised parties from across the ideological spectrum—Jaunā Vienotība, right-wing populist parties KPV LV and the NA, the centre-right JKP and the progressive Attīstībai/Par! alliance. In view of notable shifts around the world toward right-wing populism, the campaign for the 2018 parliamentary elections brought concerns that Latvia might also experience a right-wing nationalist turn toward illiberal-style democracy. This did not occur. While the newly established KPV LV did have some success in attracting votes, it was far from an electoral victory. The NA also lost four seats in the elections. Establishment parties across the spectrum experienced a decline in support, but Jaunā Vienotība’s emergence at the helm is indicative of relative stability in governance. Notably, the ZZS—linked with Lembergs, and the last of the `oligarch parties’—lost significant support. Prior to the elections, the party, which enjoys the entrenched patronage in western Latvia, had indicated a possible willingness to co-operate with Saskaņa, contrary to many of its voters’ preferences. The inclusion of KPV LV in the coalition and the absence of the ZZS also reflected a commitment to reduce the influence of oligarchs.</p>

          <heading>The Presidency of Egils Levits</heading>
          <p>On 29 May 2019 Egils Levits, an independent, was elected to the presidency. The son of anti-Soviet dissidents, his family was expelled from the USSR in the 1970s and resettled in Germany; his relatives had suffered in both the Holocaust and the Soviet deportations during the Second World War. Levits was active in the restoration of independence as a member of the LTF during 1989-91, and was an author of the Declaration on the Restoration of Independence of Latvia. Levits served as the first Minister of Justice after the restoration of the Constitution. He was the first Latvian judge at the European Court of Human Rights (1995-2004) and at the ECJ (from 2004). He also previously served as an ambassador to several European countries, and as Deputy Prime Minister. Although his politics were traditionally conservative, his candidacy for the office of President enjoyed support from across the political spectrum and within the Latvian intelligentsia. The presidency of Levits focused on identity, such as strengthening the status of the Latvian language; he was also a strong advocate for Ukraine following Russia’s 2022 invasion. However, he failed to take a leading role during the COVID-19 pandemic and many perceived him to be disconnected from day-to-day realities facing society. By the end of his time in office, the President's popularity had fallen to the lowest level since the restoration of independence. He was initially backed by the NA for re-election in 2023, but withdrew early in the contest. </p>

          <heading>The First Kariņš Government</heading>
          <p>The Kariņš Government faced multiple international crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the Belarusian presidential election of August 2020 and associated migrant crisis, and the war in Ukraine following the Russian invasion of 24 February 2022. It further contended with corresponding security, energy and economic challenges, including escalating inflation. Despite these adversities, it became the longest-serving Government in the history of democratic Latvia. From the outset, the Government maintained a pro-European, pro-NATO position. Rinkēvičs retained his post as the country’s longest-serving Minister of Foreign Affairs, while in January 2019 Artis Pabriks returned to head the Ministry of Defence, a position that he had previously held in 2010-14. Continuity in these posts reaffirmed the country’s pro-Western orientation.</p>
          <p>An early priority of the Kariņš Government was the need to address corruption and improve confidence in the banking sector, which has been mired in scandal. Latvia’s ABLV Bank was blacklisted by the USA in 2018, due to allegations of money laundering and the evasion of sanctions against the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea). Latvia’s central bank Governor, Ilmārs Rimšēvics, was also detained on suspicion of bribery and became the first representative of the European Central Bank to face corruption charges. Latvian banks were implicated in the leaked US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network files published by investigative journalists in September 2020, who reported that multiple banks in the Baltic countries had overlooked obvious signs of money laundering. However, under the Kariņš Government, Latvia’s credit rating was raised to an unprecedented A+ in February, dropping to A- in 2021, but with a stable outlook.</p>
          <p>On 22 March 2018 Parliament passed amendments to the Education Law and the Law on General Education, which required minority schools to transition to teaching core curriculum secondary education courses in the Latvian language from the beginning of the 2019/20 academic year. In 2022 Parliament adopted further changes to the educational system, requiring pre-school and school institutions to instruct only in Latvian by September 2025 (with provisions for minority curriculum subjects). The unification of state education programmes and reduction of unofficial segregation by language in the school system has been a political objective since the 1990s, and was made more pressing by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 (see below). Such shifts in education law have faced resistance from some Russian-speakers seeking to maintain Russian-language educational institutions and from external observers concerned about minority rights.</p>
          <p>In October 2020 another Kariņš priority—reform of the territorial administration—passed into law. The territorial reform reduced the number of administrative regions from 119 to 42 from 1 July 2021, in an effort to reduce the cost of managing districts and allow for more equitable investment in government services, including the over-strained education sector. The measure had been strenuously contested, as opposition and protesters criticized the centralization efforts and perceived them as a threat to regional identity.</p>
          <p>Construction work began on a new station complex in Rīga in November 2020, as part of the inter-state `Rail Baltica’ project, which has been a source of inter-Baltic frustration due to major delays. The largest modern infrastructure project in the region, the planned rail network will connect the Baltic countries to Helsinki, Finland, in the north and the European gauge system in the south. </p>
          <p>In 2020 the Constitutional Court ruled in favour of the legal rights of same-sex couples and directed Parliament to codify protections into law. However, the 13th Parliament failed to pass a civil union law. (The 14th Parliament also declined to continue this legislative effort after elections.)</p>
          <p>Kariņš announced a major cabinet reorganization after KPV LV left the coalition shortly before municipal elections on 5 June 2021 (see below), leaving a four-party minority Government (which held 48 of the 100 seats). KPV LV’s ministerial positions were redistributed among other coalition parties, with Marija Golubeva (of Attīstībai/Par!) as Minister of the Interior, Gatis Eglītis (of the JKP, known as Konservatīvie—The Conservatives from 2022) as Minister of Welfare, and Jānis Vitenbergs (now of the NA) returning as Minister of the Economy, following his defection from KPV LV. Minister of Education and Science Ilga Šuplinska was replaced by Anita Muižniece (also of the JKP). Despite its early electoral success in 2018, the populist KPV LV party had suffered internal divisions, and lost several of the 16 seats it had won, with defections including those of its two prominent former leaders, Artuss Kaimiņš and Aldis Gobzems.</p>

          <heading>The COVID-19 Pandemic</heading>
          <p>The Kariņš Government received early praise for its response to the COVID-19 crisis. The Government enacted a state of emergency weeks before the first fatality from the virus, and public social distancing measures were initially enforced without the imposition of a full lockdown. The Governments of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia worked together on applying joint border restrictions and adopted a co-operative approach to lifting restrictions in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, establishing the EU’s first `travel bubble’ in May. Economic stimulus measures were introduced, such as increased access to capital for entrepreneurs, the reorientation of workforce skills and the postponement of tax payments. Temporary subsidies to cover wages helped to limit unemployment and targeted measures were aimed at specific sectors like tourism, health care and transport. Significant state aid was allocated to Latvia’s national air carrier airBaltic and related air traffic companies. Latvia’s GDP declined by an estimated 3.6% in 2020, but grew 4.7% in 2021. The unemployment rate reached 8.6% in the second quarter following the emergency declaration of March 2020, with an average rate of 8.1% in 2020 (1.8 percentage points higher than in 2019). </p>
          <p>The pandemic produced a need for increased attention to the social safety net. The 2021 budget, approved by Parliament in December 2020, focused largely on health care. It included an allocation of €183m. to promised wage increases for medical workers. (Protests from medical professionals over low wages, overwork and unfulfilled commitments had been an early challenge for the Kariņš Government even before the onset of the pandemic.) A long-awaited wage increase was also planned for teachers, and the monthly minimum wage increased from €430 to €500. Allocations for pensions, state social security and children’s benefits also increased. However, economic concerns continued to be significant. The Baltic countries at the end of 2021 had the highest monthly inflation rates in the eurozone, with a December rate of 7.9% in Latvia. Consumers experienced inflation across goods and services, including food and housing; energy prices rose dramatically, taking a toll on industry and consumers and prompting national governments to offer support measures.</p>
          <p>Latvia received its first COVID-19 vaccines in late 2020, following a resurgence in cases across Europe. The initial vaccination programme was highly criticized due to procurement decisions. The vaccination campaign was further hindered by an over-reliance on AstraZeneca vaccines, the use of which was paused in March following concerns over side effects. As in much of the world, significant COVID-19 scepticism was reported in Latvia. Dis- and misinformation surrounding vaccination was prevalent, with opinion surveys indicating that nearly one-half of respondents believed that the Government exaggerated case numbers and one-third that the disease was being exploited by a hidden elite. Laws regulating the use of state and minority languages also proved to be a barrier to informing Russian-speakers about public health precautions. By the end of 2021 approximately 67% of the Latvian population had been fully vaccinated, and by April 2022 pandemic-related restrictions had been largely lifted.</p>

          <heading>The 2020 and 2021 Municipal Elections</heading>
          <p>Early municipal elections in Rīga in 2020 represented the first significant electoral victory for socially liberal parties since the restoration of independence. Following several months of disarray, and the removal of Mayor Ušakovs of Saskaņa (who had held the office since 2009) over a corruption scandal, Parliament dissolved the Rīga City Council and ordered pre-term elections, which were held on 29 August. These marked a notable shift away from Saskaņa’s previous dominance of local politics. The social-liberal alliance Attīstībai/Par! and the social-democrat environmentalist Progresīvie (The Progressives) secured 18 of the 60 available City Council seats. The resulting coalition was headed by Mārtiņš Staķis of Attīstībai/Par! as Mayor. (Staķis left Attīstībai/Par! in March 2022, due to disagreement over a new territorial plan for the city, but continued to serve as Mayor until resigning in July 2023.) The increased support for progressive liberalism and a dispersed Russian-speaker vote could point to a future reduction of ethnically stratified politics within the major population centre.</p>
          <p>Broader municipal elections on 5 June 2021 were the first to be conducted under new territorial reform passed in October 2020. Despite local opposition to the reform, the elections did not significantly change the balance of power in localities, and there was little backlash against the governing coalition in the first electoral test of its COVID-19 policies. However, turnout was dramatically low, at 34.0% (compared with 50.4% in the previous elections in 2017). The June elections were not held in Rīga, following the pre-term polls in 2020, and were delayed until September 2021 in the towns of Varakļāni and Rēzekne, due to outstanding issues with finalizing the territorial reform.</p>
          <p>The LRA and the ZZS, with political bases largely outside the capital, won the largest share of the vote in five local governments, fulfilling general expectations. Of the governing coalition parties, Latvijas Attīstībai was placed first in four local governments, and Jaunā Vienotība and the NA in three. Saskaņa won in two local governments. Local parties, and local and national party alliances won the remaining 14 municipalities, resulting in a fragmented local political scene, with smaller regional parties balancing those in the national Parliament.</p>
          <p>Municipal elections have long been a factor in the national political landscape, providing parties with patronage networks, such as those developed by the parties linked to Latvia’s oligarchs. Despite the territorial reform, `strongmen’ mayors largely retained their influence in Jelgava, Valmiera, Rēzekne and Liepāja. Lembergs, who has controlled the port town of Ventspils since 1988, received a five-year prison sentence in February 2021 for bribery and money laundering, after a lengthy court case. Nevertheless, his party, Latvijai un Ventspilij (For Latvia and Ventspils), won 54.3% of the votes cast to the Ventspils Council in June. (Lembergs was succeeded as Mayor in July by his former deputy, Jānis Vītoliņš.) </p>

          <heading>Baltic Security and the Invasion of Ukraine</heading>
          <p>
      Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 had a significant impact on Baltic foreign and domestic politics under the leadership of Prime Minister Kariņš. The Baltic states were among the staunchest supporters of Ukraine prior to and during the war—offering political support through their membership
      
       of the EU and NATO, as well as practical support for Ukraine’s military by supplying significant resources. At the end of 2022 the Baltic states and Poland ranked highest in terms of the provision of aid to Ukraine as a percentage of GDP. In April Estonia and Latvia were the first states to denounce Russia’s actions as genocide. Baltic parliaments further banned broadcasts by Russian state media outlets and symbols associated with the war, and took action to remove Soviet-era monuments. Latvia’s Parliament amended the immigration law in September, cancelling permanent residence permits for citizens of Russia and Belarus and requiring a Latvian language examination for reissuance. Baltic Governments further urged an end to Europe’s energy reliance on Russia (although the Russian state-owned company Gazprom holds a 34% stake in the natural gas supplier, Latvijas Gāze). The Baltic countries also reviewed their own defence policies, seeking procurements of High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems and other weaponry.
    </p>
          <p>At least 43,000 Ukrainians refugees had arrived in Latvia by December 2022. Many of the obstacles that other refugees and asylum seekers have faced when arriving in Latvia were removed for Ukrainians, for whom access to employment and social support was quickly facilitated. This reception for Ukrainian refugees stood in stark contrast to the country’s attitude toward migrants from the Middle East and Africa. In August 2021 Latvia declared a state of emergency at the border with Belarus in response to an unprecedented increase in irregular migration deemed to be an orchestrated `hybrid attack’ by Alyaksandr Lukashenka’s regime in retaliation for Baltic support of the Belarusian pro-democracy movement. The Baltic and Polish response—forcible returns, slow asylum proceedings and limited access for humanitarian groups and journalists—led to international criticism.</p>
          <p>Russia's full-scale war on Ukraine has changed the security environment and prompted NATO to re-evaluate the security needs of its eastern flank, in the Baltic states in particular. Shortly after the invasion, the `high readiness’ NATO Response Force was activated for defence purposes for the first time, and in the following weeks the Baltic states received a series of NATO leaders, who emphasized their commitment to the region. Under pressure from eastern flank members, NATO moved to enhance its forward presence with four new multinational battlegroups and to increase some battlegroups from battalion to brigade size. The Russian aggression against Ukraine also prompted Sweden and Finland to apply to join the Alliance, fundamentally altering the security posture of the Baltic Sea region and amplifying NATO control of the Baltic Sea. (Finland was admitted to NATO in April 2023, while Sweden's application was delayed by member states Türkiye and Hungary.) </p>

          <heading>The 14th Parliament</heading>
          <p>Elections for the 14th Parliament were held on 1 October 2022. The voter turnout was 59%, a slight increase from the 2018 elections. Seven of the 19 party lists contesting the elections won seats; 29 of the elected deputies were women. While the electoral campaigns initially focused on frustrations over COVID-19 policies, attention shifted to the war following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Kariņš, Latvia had taken a strong pro-Ukraine stance; his party—the centrist Jaunā Vienotība—secured a clear mandate, winning 26 seats. In contrast, other members of the 13th Parliament’s governing coalition did not fare as well. Voter support for both Konservatīvie and the liberal Attīstībai/Par! fell below the required 5% threshold and they failed to secure any seats. The far-right NA retained its 13 seats, although its vote share decreased compared with the 2018 elections. The Apvienotais Saraksts (United List), a loose political formation headed by businessman Uldis Pīlēns and comprising regional parties, secured 15 seats. Two groups connected to oligarchs made gains: the ZZS alliance led by Lembergs acquired 16 seats, while Latvija Pirmajā Vietā (Latvia First), a new party chaired by Šlesers, obtained nine.</p>
          <p>Notably, Saskaņa, which had won a plurality in the past three elections, was ousted from Parliament. Traditionally supported by Latvia’s Russophone population, Saskaņa had quickly denounced Russia’s actions following the invasion of Ukraine. This stance may have pushed some voters toward Stabilitātei! (For Stability!), led by former Saskaņa member Aleksejs Rosļikovs. Stabilitātei!, which obtained 11 seats, attracted voters with a populist campaign that focused on anti-vaccine and anti-lockdown sentiments, as well as a refusal to criticize the war. Younger Russian-speaking voters, on the other hand, seemed to be divided in political preference, with many strengthening support for the liberal Progresīvie, which received 10 seats. </p>

An effort by Jaunā Vienotība to include the more ideologically aligned Progresīvie was unsuccessful and Progresīvie remained in opposition.

          <p>The new Parliament began its mandate during a time of soaring inflation across Europe, and in the Baltic states in particular—in September 2022 the inflation rate reached 22% in Latvia, although it was expected to moderate in 2023. Transatlantic security remained key to Latvian foreign policy, with a continuing firm stance in support of Ukraine. The 2023 budget further outlined initial priorities of the 14th Parliament. In the education sector, this included an allocation of €61.6m. to increase teachers' salaries, with additional funding for the transition to teaching in the Latvian language, new state examinations, and higher education and science, among other priorities. More than €85m. was designated for health care, including wage increases for medical professionals. Welfare, investment in the labour market, and internal affairs were also highlighted in the budget, as was a large increase in funding for culture—in particular, support for the 150th anniversary of the Nationwide Song and Dance Festival, which took place in July 2023.</p>
          <p>Early acts of the Government included the establishment of a new Ministry of Climate and Energy, with effect from 1 January 2023. In April Parliament approved the reintroduction of compulsory national defence service, beginning with the first voluntary conscription in July.</p>
