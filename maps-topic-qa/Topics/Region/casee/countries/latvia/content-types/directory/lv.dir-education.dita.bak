                    <p id="LV.IS.58">Primary education begins at seven years of age and lasts for four years. Secondary education, beginning at the age of 11, comprises a first cycle of five years and a second of three years. In 2019/20 enrolment at pre-primary schools was equivalent to 94.6% of pupils in the relevant age-group. In 2021/22 enrolment at primary schools included 98.6% of pupils (males 98.2%; females 98.9%) in the relevant age-group; enrolment in lower secondary schools included 98.7% of pupils (males 98.3%; females 99.0%) in the relevant age-group, while enrolment in upper secondary schools included 94.3% of all pupils (males 93.2%; females 95.4%) in the relevant age-group. In March 2018 Parliament approved legislation providing for the withdrawal of minority-language education in core subjects at secondary schools with effect from 2019. In 2021 expenditure on education represented some 12.7% of total government expenditure.</p>
