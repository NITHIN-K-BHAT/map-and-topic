                    <heading>The Constitution</heading>
                    <p id="LV.DIR.3">The Constitution of the Republic of Latvia, which had been adopted on 15 February 1922, was annulled at the time of the Soviet annexation in 1940. Latvia became a Union Republic of the USSR and a new Soviet-style Constitution became the legal basis for the governmental system of the republic. The constitutional authority for Latvian membership of the USSR, the Resolution on Latvian Entry into the USSR of 21 July 1940, was declared null and void on 4 May 1990. In the same declaration the Latvian Supreme Council announced the restoration of Articles 1, 2 and 3 of the 1922 Constitution, which describe Latvia as an independent and sovereign state, and Article 6, which states that the Parliament (Saeima) is elected by universal, equal, direct and secret vote, on the basis of proportional representation. On 6 July 1993 the 1922 Constitution was fully restored by the Saeima, following its election on 5 and 6 June. A summary of the Constitution’s main provisions is given below. On 19 June 2014 Parliament approved a Preamble, guaranteeing the national culture and language, and defining the nation—state with historic reference to the state proclaimed in 1918 and restored in 1991.</p>

                         <p id="LV.DIR.5">Latvia is an independent, democratic republic, in which the sovereign power of the State belongs to the people. The territory of the Republic of Latvia comprises the provinces of Vidzeme, Latgale, Kurzeme and Zemgale, within the boundaries stipulated by inter­national treaties.</p>

                         <p id="LV.DIR.7">The Saeima (Parliament) comprises 100 representatives of the people and, according to a constitutional amendment adopted in December 1997, is elected by universal, equal, direct and secret vote, on the basis of proportional representation, for a period of four years. All Latvian citizens who have attained 18 years of age are entitled to vote and are eligible for election to Parliament.</p>
                         <p id="LV.DIR.8">
            Parliament elects a Board, which consists of the Chairperson, two Deputies, and Secretaries. The Board convenes the sessions of Parliament and decrees regular and extraordinary sittings. The sessions of Parliament are public (sittings 
            <i>in camera</i>
             are held only by special request).
          </p>
                         <p id="LV.DIR.9">The right of legislation belongs to both Parliament and the people. Draft laws may be presented to Parliament by the President of the Republic, the Cabinet of Ministers, the Committees of Parliament, no fewer than five members of Parliament, or, in special cases, by one-tenth of the electorate. Before the commencement of each financial year, Parliament approves the state budget, the draft of which is submitted by the Cabinet of Ministers. Parliament decides on the strength of the armed forces during peacetime. The ratification of Parliament is indispensable to all international agreements dealing with issues resolved by legislation.</p>
                         <p>In 2009 an amendment was introduced permitting the electorate to vote by referendum to dissolve the legislature during the second and third years of its term.</p>

                         <p id="LV.DIR.11">The President of the Republic is elected by a secret ballot of Parliament for a period of four years. At least 51 deputies must vote for the winning candidate. No person of less than 40 years of age may be elected President of the Republic. The office of President is not compatible with any other office, and the President may serve for no longer than two consecutive terms.</p>
                         <p id="LV.DIR.12">The President represents the State in an international capacity; he or she appoints Latvian representatives abroad, and receives representatives of foreign states accredited to Latvia; implements the decisions of Parliament concerning the ratification of international treaties; is Head of the Armed Forces; appoints a Commander-in-Chief in time of war; and has the power to declare war on the basis of a decision of Parliament.</p>
                         <p id="LV.DIR.13">The President has the right to pardon criminals serving penal sentences; to convene extraordinary meetings of the Cabinet of Ministers for the discussion of an agenda prepared by him or her, and to preside over such meetings; and to propose the dissolution of Parliament. </p>
                         <p>The President may be held criminally accountable with the agreement of Parliament by a majority vote of no fewer than two-thirds of its members.</p>

                         <p id="LV.DIR.15">The Cabinet comprises the Prime Minister and the ministers nominated by him/her. This task is entrusted to the Prime Minister by the President of the Republic. All state administrative institutions are subordinate to the Cabinet, which, in turn, is accountable to Parliament. If Parliament adopts a vote expressing no confidence in the Prime Minister, the entire Cabinet must resign. The Cabinet discusses all draft laws presented by the ministries as well as issues concerning the activities of the ministries. If the State is threatened by foreign invasion or if events endangering the existing order of the State arise, the Cabinet has the right to proclaim a state of emergency.</p>

                         <p id="LV.DIR.17">All citizens are equal before the law and the courts. Judges are independent and bound only by law. The appointment of judges is confirmed by Parliament. Judges may be dismissed from office against their will only by a decision of the Supreme Court. The retiring age for judges is stipulated by law. Judgment may be passed solely by institutions that have been so empowered by law and in such a manner as specified by law. A Constitutional Court was established in 1996 to examine the legality of legislation.</p>
