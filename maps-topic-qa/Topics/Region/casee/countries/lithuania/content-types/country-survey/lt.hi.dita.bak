          <heading>Early History</heading>
          <p id="LT.HI.P1">The Lithuanian state emerged in the 13th century, when the regional chieftain, Mindaugas (Mindouh), imposed his rule on the majority of Lithuanian tribes. The last pagan outpost in Europe, Lithuania was under constant attack by crusaders until the 15th century. However, the Lithuanian Grand Dukes parried the crusader attacks, and by a skilful blend of conquest, marriage alliances and compromise with the local nobility expanded Lithuania’s borders to the Black Sea and beyond Smolensk (Russia). In 1386 the Lithuanian Grand Duke, Jogaila (Jagiełło, baptized Wladysław in 1386), married the Polish Queen Jadwiga (Hedwig), instituting an alliance that lasted until the late 18th century. When the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was partitioned, ethno­graphic Lithuania was absorbed into the Russian Empire.</p>
          <p id="LT.HI.P2">The alliance with Poland was a mixed blessing for Lithuania. Although its links with Poland ensured the country’s integration into Western Christendom, the nobility and burghers were `polonized’, dividing the country into two distinct groups—a literate elite who could not speak Lithuanian and an illiterate peasantry who could. During the early years of tsarist rule (1795-1915) the authorities generally ignored the peasantry. However, following the insurrection of 1863, they opted for a policy of russification, banning the publication of Lithuanian-language books in the Latin script, and imposing restrictions on the activity of the Catholic Church. This assault on language and religion had the reverse effect, galvanizing the Church and a small body of intellectuals into efforts to preserve the national identity. Newspapers were published in Prussia and the USA, and smuggled into Lithuania. Political con­sciousness matured, and demands for autonomy, and then independence, were pressed.</p>

          <heading>Independent Lithuania</heading>
          <p id="LT.HI.P3">The collapse of the Russian and German Empires during the First World War permitted the rebirth of the Lithuanian state. Germany, which occupied Lithuania in 1915, allowed the formation of the Council of Lithuania, expecting it to create a subservient puppet state. However, on 16 February 1918 the Council declared Lithuania’s independence, and by the end of the year Lithuanians began to assume control of the country. Securing independence required two years of intermittent warfare and the loss of a significant amount of territory, including the Vilnius (Wilno) region, which Polish troops occupied in October 1920. This loss was offset in part by the seizure in 1923 of the former German territory of Klaipėda (Memel), then under the jurisdiction of the League of Nations. Most Western countries had extended diplomatic recognition to Lithuania by the end of 1922.</p>
          <p id="LT.HI.P4">
      The Constituent Assembly, elected in April 1920, ratified a Constitution establishing a democratic republic that granted Parliament extensive powers, including the right to elect the President. Until 1926 the Lietuvos Krikščionių Demokratų Partija (LKDP—Christian Democratic Party of Lithuania) and its allies dominated Parliament, adopting legislation that set the framework for civic life. When a coalition of leftists and minorities assumed power following the elections in May 1926, disgruntled army officers, and members of the LKDP and of the Lietuvių Tautininkų Sąjunga (LTS—Lithuanian Nationalist Union) organized a 
      <i>putsch</i>
       on 16 December. Antanas Smetona, the leader of the LTS and former Chairman of the Council of Lithuania, became President. Smetona maintained power until the Soviet occupation in 1940. Although opposition political parties were banned and the media was censored, the population tolerated the mildly authoritarian regime.
    </p>
          <p id="LT.HI.P5">During the period between the First and Second World Wars the economy was rebuilt. The radical agrarian reform of 1922 ensured a measure of social justice. The standard of living rose steadily, even during the Great Depression. Although the country remained underdeveloped industrially, it created a comprehensive educational system, fostered the arts, and developed an adequate health system. However, the most important achievement was the revival of national consciousness and the growth of civic and national pride.</p>

     <gen-section print-style="COLUMN" sllink="SLSDOC" slsdocrf="GEN-SECTREF">
          <heading>The Years of Occupation</heading>
          <p id="LT.HI.P6">The Molotov-Ribbentrop, Nazi-Soviet Pact, signed on 23 August 1939, divided Eastern Europe into `spheres of influence’, preparing for Lithuania’s occupation. The Soviet authorities wasted little time in asserting their claims under the Pact’s `Secret Protocols’. On 10 October Lithuania was coerced into signing a Treaty of Mutual Assistance that allowed the Soviet Red Army to establish bases there. On 15 June 1940 Red Army units occupied Lithuania, and on 3 August Lithuania was forcibly incorporated into the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR).</p>
          <p id="LT.HI.P7">The Soviet model of society was rapidly imposed on Lithuania. Industry was nationalized, strict censorship introduced, and all non-communist organizations banned. The deportation of about 20,000 people just one week before the German attack on the USSR convinced many Lithuanians that the communists had embarked on a policy of extreme repression.</p>
          <p id="LT.HI.P8">At the beginning of the German-Soviet conflict on 22 June 1941, thousands of Lithuanians rebelled against the withdrawing Soviets. A Provisional Government re-established Lithuanian independence. However, within six weeks the Germans installed their own administration, the chief task of which was to ensure Lithuanian contributions to the Nazi military machine. During the German occupation the Nazis and local collaborators killed about 90% of Lithuania’s 200,000 Jews.</p>
          <p id="LT.HI.P9">The return of the Red Army in 1944 was greeted with trepidation. More than 60,000 individuals fled to the West, and thousands of young men joined partisan bands that fought the Soviet security forces until 1952. As many as 30,000 partisans died in the struggle. The communists responded with mass arrests and the collectivization of agriculture. Deportations occurred almost annually until 1951. About 200,000 persons, or some 10% of the total population, were victims of communist repression.</p>
          <p id="LT.HI.P10">Terror eased after the death of Stalin (Iosif Dzhugashvili) in 1953. Owing to a smaller influx of Russians than occurred in the other two Baltic states and previous industrial underdevelopment, ethnic Lithu­anians still constituted 80% of the population and, by 1970, 67% of the members of the Communist Party of Lithuania (CPL), as well as a decisive majority among leading government officials.</p>
          <p id="LT.HI.P11">During Soviet rule illiteracy was eliminated, and higher education improved. Medical care became universally available. After two decades of decline, agricultural output improved dramatically and surpassed that of most Soviet republics. Industrialization gathered momentum in the 1970s. The standard of living rose steadily until 1985. Relative economic welfare conferred a measure of legitimacy on the regime.</p>
          <p id="LT.HI.P12">
      Undercurrents of dissatisfaction remained strong, however. Although the Government’s campaign against the Catholic Church was relentless, the Church succeeded in retaining genuine independence and the sympathy of many Lithuanians, who came to consider it as the chief defender of patriotic values. Confronted with renewed repression in the early 1970s, militant priests began to publish the clandestine 
      <i>Chronicle of the Catholic Church in Lithuania</i>
      . Lay Catholics and anti-communist intellectuals followed the lead of the Chronicle and founded a number of independent, 
      <i>samizdat</i>
       (self-published) publications. Although most were rapidly suppressed and their editors imprisoned, Lithuania produced more 
      <i>samizdat</i>
       publications per head than any other Soviet republic.

          <heading>The Road to Independence</heading>
          <p id="LT.HI.P13">Lithuania regained its independence in an astonishingly brief period. At the end of 1987 conservative elements controlled the CPL, and were planning a new campaign against nationalism and Catholicism. Barely two years later, on 11 March 1990, Lithuania declared the re-establishment of its independence. The founding meeting of the Lithuanian Movement for Reconstruction (Sąjūdis) on 3 June 1988 was a milestone in Lithuania’s national rebirth. The Movement’s initial goals were modest: co-operation with the authorities in fostering reform; the creation of separate republican citizenship; and greater economic, cultural and political autonomy. Several propitious decisions ensured the future of Sąjūdis, in particular its rejection of the tutelage of the CPL and its decision to mobilize the population in support of its programme.</p>
          <p id="LT.HI.P14">In October 1988 the CPL elected Algirdas Brazauskas as its First Secretary. The conciliatory attitude adopted by Brazauskas and the leaders of Sąjūdis soon fell victim to the dictates of political reality and to rising expectations. Sąjūdis, under the leadership of Vytautas Landsbergis, and the CPL vied for public support, with Sąjūdis emerging as the clear winner. In the March 1989 elections to the all-Union Congress of People’s Deputies, Sąjūdis candi­dates won 37 of the 42 contested seats in Lithuania. The defeat in the elections convinced moderates in the CPL that anything less than severance of formal links with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) would be tantamount to political suicide. On 20 December the Party Congress voted for the establishment of an independent CPL.</p>
          <p id="LT.HI.P15">Sąjūdis won a decisive majority of seats in the elections to the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet (Supreme Council, the republican legislature) on 24 February 1990. On 11 March, in its first session, the newly elected legislature approved a declaration proclaiming the restoration of Lithuanian sovereignty. Landsbergis was elected Chairman of the Supreme Council, defeating Brazauskas. Kazimiera Danutė Prunskienė was appointed Prime Minister.</p>
     </gen-section>
     <gen-section print-style="COLUMN" sllink="SLSDOC" slsdocrf="GEN-SECTREF">
          <heading>Consolidation of Independence</heading>
          <p id="LT.HI.P16">The Soviet central authorities reacted harshly to Lithuania’s actions, imposing an economic blockade, which began on 18 April 1990 and remained in force for over two months. Most Western governments urged Lithuania to seek a compromise, but the Sąjūdis majority in the Supreme Council refused to accept any accord that could be interpreted as suspending the acts of independence.</p>
          <p id="LT.HI.P17">The initial euphoria that accompanied the surge to independence soon dissolved. Parliament and the Government quarrelled over the division of powers and duties. Landsbergis and Prunskienė disagreed sharply on policy towards the USSR, Prunskienė being more willing to make concessions. Tension mounted until Prunskienė and the Government were forced to resign on 10 January 1991. The new Prime Minister, Gediminas Vagnorius, was a firm supporter of Lands­bergis. The Soviet authorities continued to increase pressure, and resorted to force, dispatching tanks and troops to occupy key parts of the capital, Vilnius. On 13-14 January a column of tanks fired on a crowd of civilians gathered around the Vilnius television tower, killing 14 and wounding hundreds. The violence was counterproductive, as citizens rallied to support the Government.</p>
          <p id="LT.HI.P18">The failure of the conservative coup in the Russian and Soviet capital, Moscow, in August 1991 and the resulting ascendancy of the Russian President, Boris Yeltsin, resolved the impasse. Western countries recognized Lithuania’s independence, as did the new Soviet State Council on 6 September.</p>
          <p id="LT.HI.P19">Independence did not, however, herald an era of political consensus. Although the policies of Landsbergis seemed to be vindicated, political fortunes changed dramatically. The standard of living decreased sharply, economic reforms were ineffective, and the dismantling of the collective farms caused anger, undermining Landsbergis’s efforts to establish a powerful presidency. On 9 July 1992 the Supreme Council dissolved itself.</p>
          <p id="LT.HI.P20">The results of the elections held on 25 October and 15 November 1992 were unexpected. The former CPL, reconstituted as the Lietuvos Demokratinė Darbo Partija (LDDP—Lithuanian Democratic Labour Party) in December 1990, won 76 of the 141 seats in the Seimas (Parliament, as the Supreme Council had been renamed); pro-Landsbergis Sąjūdis candi­dates won 49. Three factors played a central role in the LDDP’s victory: Brazauskas’ popularity; anger at Sąjūdis’ confrontational style of politics; and dissatisfaction with the worsening economic situation. Proving that the parliamentary election results were not fortuitous, Brazauskas was elected President of the Republic in the direct presi­dential election of 14 February 1993.</p>
          <p id="LT.HI.P21">Fears that the LDDP would halt economic reforms proved to be unfounded. Adolfas Šleževičius, appointed as Prime Minister in March 1993, continued Lithuania’s transition to a market economy. Despite sharp declines in industrial production and the standard of living, the Government fulfilled the austere conditions of the eco­nomic memorandum signed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The expected improvement of the economy did not materialize, however. Public dissatisfaction with the Government was also fuelled by its indifference to corruption.</p>
          <gen-section print-style="COLUMN" sllink="SLSDOC" slsdocrf="GEN-SECTREF">
               <heading>The Parliamentary Elections of 1996</heading>
               <p id="LT.HI.P23">In the parliamentary elections, held on 20 October and 10 No­vember 1996, the Tėvynės Sąjunga (TS—Homeland Union), led by Lands­bergis and consisting primarily of former members of Sąjūdis, obtained 70 of the 141 seats, while its ally, the revived LKDP, secured 16. The LDDP suffered a defeat, the magnitude of which was as unexpected as the party’s triumph four years earlier. It obtained only 12 seats, and one-sixth of the votes that it had won in 1992. Landsbergis was elected Chairman of Parliament, while Vagnorius again became Prime Minister.</p>
               <p id="LT.HI.P24">The coalition Government of the TS and LKDP, which held a strong majority in Parliament, enacted a series of reforms to foster economic expansion, improve tax collection, and raise the standard of living. Frustrated by his growing political isolation, Brazauskas decided not to seek a second presidential term. In the presidential election held in January 1998 Valdas Adamkus, an émigré who had fled Lithuania in 1944, narrowly defeated former Prosecutor-General Artūras Paulauskas. Adamkus assumed an active role in political life; seeking to increase the power of the presidency, he became embroiled in a bitter quarrel with Vagnorius, who resigned on 3 May. Two weeks later Rolandas Paksas, the Mayor of Vilnius, was appointed Prime Minister. He resigned on 27 October, protesting against the decision of the cabinet to approve the sale of the Mažeikiai Nafta petroleum refinery to a US company, Williams International. Andrius Kubilius of the TS, hitherto First Deputy Chairman of Parliament, was sworn in as Prime Minister on 3 November. Kubilius’ Government succeeded in reducing the budget deficit, limiting public spending and renegotiating an agreement with the IMF. But the measures were not enough to revive his party’s declining political fortunes.</p>

               <heading>The Parliamentary Elections of 2000</heading>
               <p id="LT.HI.P25">Parliamentary elections held in October 2000 led to another change of direction in Lithuanian politics. The TS won only nine seats, while a coalition of the LDDP and the Lietuvos Socialdemokratų Partija (LSDP—Lithuanian Social Democratic Party) obtained the largest share of votes and seats (51). However, two newly founded parties, Lietuvos Liberalų Sąjunga (LLS—Lithuanian Liberal Union), chaired by Paksas, and Naujoji Sąjunga—Socialliberalai (NS, New Union—Social Liberals), led by Paulauskas, received enough seats (34 and 29, respectively) and the support of several minor parties to form the new ruling coalition, with Paksas as premier. The coalition was fragile from the outset, as the LLS was pro-business and right of centre, while the NS had a populist leftist orientation. Paksas resigned in June 2001, after the NS withdrew from the Government; Brazauskas, the leader of the LSDP (the coalition having united into a single party in January), became Prime Minister.</p>
               <p id="LT.HI.P27">In an unexpected development, Paksas defeated Adamkus in the second round of the presidential election held on 5 January 2003. However, Paksas’ tenure as President was short-lived. In October 2003 the State Security Department accused members of the President’s staff, including his national security adviser, of links with Russian organized crime. By December Paksas was politically isolated; Parliament had instituted impeachment proceedings; and the Constitutional Court had ruled that Paksas had violated the Constitution by granting citizenship to Yurii Borisov, his chief campaign financier. On 6 April 2004 Parliament voted to remove Paksas from office. (In December 2005 the Supreme Court cleared Paksas of the criminal charge that he had divulged state secrets, but the decision had no effect on the previous ruling of the Constitutional Court.)</p>

               <heading>The Presidential and Parliamentary Elections of 2004</heading>
               <p id="LT.HI.P28">In the pre-term presidential election held in 2004, former President Adamkus and former Prime Minister Prunskienė secured places in the second round of voting on 27 June, which Adamkus won by a narrow margin, receiving 52.7% of the votes cast. He was inaugurated as President on 12 July.</p>
               <p id="LT.HI.P29">Parliamentary elections, held in October 2004, proved inconclusive. The Darbo Partija (DP—Labour Party), led by the Russian-born businessman Viktor Uspaskikh, won the most seats (39 of 141). It formed a coalition with the ruling parties of the previous Government, the LSDP and the NS. Brazauskas again assumed the premiership. By May 2006 both the NS and the DP had withdrawn from the ruling coalition. Gediminas Kirkilas of the LSDP, together with several minor parties, succeeded in forming a minority coalition Government that also had the unofficial support of the TS until the end of 2007. In January 2008 the NS rejoined the Government, giving it a majority in Parliament.</p>

               <heading>The Parliamentary Elections of 2008 and Presidential Election of 2009</heading>
               <p id="LT.HI.P30">The parliamentary elections held on 12 and 26 October 2008 signalled a clear shift to the right. The Tėvynės Sąjunga-Lietuvos Krikščionys Demokratai (TS-LKD—Homeland Union—Lithuanian Christian Democrats), recently formed by a merger of the TS and the Lietuvos Krikščionys Demokratai (LKD—Lithuanian Christian Democrats), won 45 of the 141 seats. Two right-of-centre, liberal parties together garnered 19 seats. These three parties formed a coalition Government with the recently established Tautos Prisikėlimo Partija (TPP—National Revival Party), which won 16 seats. The LSDP lost support, securing only 25 seats.</p>
               <p id="LT.HI.P31">In November 2008 Kubilius, Prime Minister in 1999-2000, was again chosen to head the Government, which was confronted with the challenge of a major recession. The Government reduced salaries and pensions, increased taxes, and adopted other austerity measures that prompted public anger. Moreover, the TPP split into two factions, with a majority of its deputies announcing their opposition to the Government in March 2010, leaving it without a secure parliamentary majority. However, the opposition parties were reluctant to assume power in uncertain economic times, and did not seek to oust the ruling coalition. In October 2012 the Government became Lithuania’s first to complete its full four-year term.</p>
               <p id="LT.HI.P32">A relative outsider, Dalia Grybauskaitė (hitherto European Commissioner responsible for Financial Programming and the Budget), contested the presidential election of 17 May 2009 as an economist and technocrat, unencumbered by ties with any political party or special interest group, thus asserting that she could overcome the divisions in Lithuanian society. Her message resonated among Lithuanian voters, and she was elected by a striking majority, receiving 69.1% of the valid votes cast. Grybauskaitė was inaugurated as President on 12 July.</p>
               <p id="LT.HI.P33">From the outset, Grybauskaitė took charge of foreign and security affairs, which, together with judicial policy, constitute the three areas in which the Constitution grants the President special prerogatives. Initially, she avoided involvement in controversial domestic matters, but in 2011 she adopted a more active role, successfully challenging both Parliament and the Government. That Parliament overrode her presidential veto for the first time only in May 2012—almost three years after she took office—demonstrated Grybauskaitė’s dominant position. Her popularity subsequently diminished, owing to her failure to enunciate a clearer vision of her goals, her brusque manner, and support of right-of-centre parties in the parliamentary elections of 2012.</p>

               <heading>The Parliamentary Elections of 2012 and Presidential Election of 2014</heading>
               <p id="LT.HI.P34">The left regained power at the parliamentary elections held on 14 and 28 October 2012, having campaigned on the pledge to form a ruling coalition more sensitive to the needs of ordinary Lithuanians. The new coalition comprised the LSDP, which held 37 of the 141 seats, the DP, with 29, and the Paksas-led Partija Tvarka ir Teisingumas (TT—Order and Justice Party), with 11. Akcja Wyborcza Polaków na Litwie (AWPL—Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania) became the fourth partner in the coalition, which had a firm majority of 85 of 141 seats. The LSDP Chairman, Algirdas Butkevičius, was appointed Prime Minister. The TS-LKD also performed strongly, winning 36 seats.</p>
               <p id="LT.HI.P35">The new Government had a difficult start. Grybauskaitė rejected the candidacies of 10 potential ministers, delaying its formation. Frequent public quarrels among the coalition partners subsequently hampered the Government’s work. In August 2014 the AWPL left the governing coalition. Despite strained relations, the remainder of the coalition endured, while the LSDP-led Government and Prime Minister Butkevičius retained the support of many voters until mid-2016.</p>
               <p id="LT.HI.P36">
        In 2014 Grybauskaitė became the first Lithuanian President to be elected to two consecutive terms. In the first round of voting in the presidential election, held on 11 May, she attracted 46.6% of the votes, with her closest rival, Zigmantas Balčytis of the LSDP, winning only 13.8%. In the second round, held on 25 May, Grybauskaitė received 59.1% of the votes, compared with Balčytis’ 41.0%. Grybauskaitė’s firm stance against growing Russian assertiveness (see 
        <i>Foreign Relations</i>
        ) and demands for increased defence spending resonated among voters. Opposition parties performed better than expected in the elections to the European Parliament, held concurrently with the second round of presidential voting, indicating growing dissatisfaction with the Government’s relative passivity.
      </p>
               <p id="LT.HI.P37">Municipal elections, held in March 2015, included direct mayoral elections for the first time. The LSDP won the most seats throughout the country. However, it fared poorly in all the major cities, and the performance of the two other coalition parties, the DP and the TT, was weak. The TS-LKD performed strongly, while the Lietuvos Respublikos Liberalų Sąjūdis (LRLS—Liberal Movement of the Republic of Lithuania) was placed a close third.</p>

               <heading>The Parliamentary Elections of 2016</heading>
               <p id="LT.HI.P38">The parliamentary elections, held on 9 and 23 October 2016, caused upheaval in Lithuanian politics. A hitherto minor party, the Lietuvos Valstiečių ir Žaliųjų Sąjunga (LVŽS—Lithuanian Farmers’ and Greens’ Union), won 54 seats of a total of 141; despite receiving only 22.5% of the votes cast, it secured 35 seats in the second round of elections in single-mandate constituencies. The parties of the government coalition were overwhelmingly defeated. </p>
               <p id="LT.HI.P39">Several factors contributed to the success of the LVŽS. All three parties in the previous ruling coalition, as well as the LRLS, had been involved in corruption scandals. The Chairman of the LVŽS, business magnate Ramūnas Karbauskis, had won broad acclaim for his electoral pledges to combat the abuse of alcohol, and the party had convinced Saulius Skvernelis, the well-regarded former Minister of the Interior, to join its ranks. Most importantly, the LVŽS appealed to broad cross-sections of the population by presenting a programme that was both socially conservative and economically progressive, pledging that professional specialists, rather than career politicians, would be in charge of the ministries of a technocratic government, while promising to halt emigration from Lithuania (notably to other EU member states).</p>
               <p id="LT.HI.P40">The LVŽS formed a ruling coalition with the LSDP, taking charge of 11 ministries, while allocating just four to the LSDP. Skvernelis became Prime Minister, while Karbauskis accepted the modest post of faction leader in the Parliament. The Government’s performance was mixed. In addition to a number of minor scandals, it attracted the hostility of much of the press and of Grybauskaitė, whose initial favourable attitude was soon replaced by open hostility. A number of missteps led to a further erosion of support and a decidedly poor performance in all three elections held in early 2019.</p>

               <heading>The 2019 Elections</heading>
               <p id="LT.HI.P41">Municipal elections were held in early 2019, followed by elections to the presidency and to the European Parliament. In the municipal polls on 3 March, the TS-LKD and the LSDP elected substantially more mayors and city and town councillors than the LVŽS, which had hoped to repeat its success in the 2016 parliamentary elections. However, the overall victors in the municipal elections were the so-called public committees, formed to support one or two electoral candidates. These committees received 26% of the votes, followed by the TS-LKD with 16% and the LSDP with 13%. Furthermore, the committees won the mayoral elections in Lithuania’s five largest cities. Their success demonstrated once again the electorate’s distrust of political parties that are believed to be dishonest and indifferent to public welfare.</p>
               <p>The results of the elections to the European Parliament, also conducted on 26 May 2019, were more predictable. The TS-LKD, which had led in the polls, won 18.6% of the votes, and three of Lithuania’s 11 seats in Parliament. The LSDP was placed second, with 15.1%, while the ruling LVŽS was third, with 11.9%, both parties securing two seats. Three other parties won one seat each, as did an independent candidate.</p>
               <p id="LT.HI.P42">Since Lithuania’s Constitution limits the President to two consecutive terms of office, President Grybauskaitė was not eligible to seek re-election. Gitanas Nausėda, a banker with no party affiliation, surged to a decisive victory in the second round of election, held on 26 May 2019, attracting 65.7% of the votes cast and winning in every electoral district. The substantial margin of his victory was unexpected, since his opponent, former Minister of Finance Ingrida Šimonytė, who was supported by the TS-LKD, had secured 31.3% in the first round on 12 May, defeating Nausėda by less than 0.5% of the vote. Prime Minister Skvernelis was placed third in the first round, with 19.6% of the votes.</p>
               <p id="LT.HI.P43">In contrast to Grybauskaitė, Nausėda declared his firm intention to adopt an active role in domestic and economic policy, in order to limit social exclusion and create a more generous welfare state. Although Parliament rejected some of his initial suggestions and overrode several of his vetoes, Nausėda took advantage of the weakening of the governing coalition to ensure that subsequent vetoes would be sustained. However, he did not convince a recalcitrant Parliament to pass legislation to reduce social inequality, even though the LVŽS espoused similar goals.</p>
               <p id="LT.HI.P47">The popularity of the LVŽS declined throughout 2019, but rigorous government measures ensured that Lithuania had one of the lowest rates of infection for COVID-19 in Europe, following the global spread of the pandemic, raising expectations of victory in the parliamentary elections in October 2020. However, cases of COVID-19 rose in the weeks before the vote, while the LVŽS’s failure to fulfil its electoral promises, as well as its combative rhetoric, paternalistic attitude toward the population, and inability to co-operate with other left-of-centre parties both in the Parliament and during the election campaign dashed these hopes.</p>

          <heading>Political Developments since 2020</heading>
          <p>Parliamentary elections, held on 11 and 25 October 2020, returned the TS-LKD and its centre-right allies to power after eight years in opposition. The TS-LKD attracted 24.9% of the votes and won 50 of the 141 seats, while the LVŽS managed just 17.4% of the votes and 32 seats. The LRLS and the newly founded Laisvės Partija (LP—Freedom Party) accepted an invitation from the TS-LKD to join the ruling coalition. Each was granted three ministerial portfolios. The TS-LKD received several portfolios, including the crucial Ministries of Finance, Foreign Affairs and Defence. Parliament confirmed Ingrida Šimonytė as Prime Minister on 24 November, and approved the Government on 11 December.</p>
          <p>During its first months in office the Government focused on fighting the pandemic, introducing a very strict quarantine that closed all but essential businesses, initially forbidding any home visits or travel to other municipalities, and refusing to make any exceptions. By the end of February 2021 it had made substantial progress in reducing the per-capita infection rate (the highest in the EU in December), thus permitting a modest easing of the draconian restrictions.</p>
          <p>The Government did not face serious challenges from the opposition parties, which were in a state of disarray. After posting homophobic remarks on social media in January 2021, the leader of the DP, Uspaskikh, was expelled from the Renew Europe group of the European Parliament. Gintaras Paluckas was compelled to resign as the leader of the LSDP, after the party won a disappointing 13 seats. Citing discrimination by the new ruling coalition, Karbauskis resigned from Parliament, but remained the Chairman of the LVŽS. However, as an ordinary citizen he had limited influence, lacking the public forum and mandate of Parliament.</p>
          <p>
      The ruling coalition made little use of these favourable circumstances. It struggled to devise and implement a consistent policy to combat COVID-19 or to respond dynamically to calls for measures against inflation and to support citizens most severely affected by the rises in prices. Its decision authorizing the Republic of China (Taiwan) to open a Taiwanese Representative Office in Vilnius led the People’s Republic of China to impose economic sanctions (see 
      <i>Foreign Relations</i>
      ) and was widely unpopular among Lithuania’s citizens (with approval of less than 20%). The Government became embroiled in a series of challenges and bitter disputes with the President. The TS-LDK sought to change the practice of the President representing Lithuania at meetings of the European Council, arguing that the Prime Minister should attend when internal EU affairs dominated the agenda. President Nausėda dismissed the proposal. In turn, the Government rejected his suggestions for revisions to the budget and tax code, and calls for increases in the minimum wage and pensions. The unconstructive bickering, as well as sharp rises in energy prices, led to a significant fall in the Government’s popularity. In one opinion poll conducted in early 2022 not a single minister received a favourable rating.
    </p>
          <p>The opposition has regrouped. After the election of a popular member of the European Parliament, Vilija Blinkevičiūtė, as Chairman of the LSDP, its ratings have often surpassed those of all other parties. Former Prime Minister Skvernelis and other leading members left the LVŽS and founded a new party, Demokratų Sąjunga `Vardan Lietuvos’ (Union of Democrats `For Lithuania’), in January 2022. According to polling results, the new party had become among the most popular in the country, while the LVŽS has won back the favour of some of its disappointed supporters.</p>
          <p>In municipal elections held on 5 and 19 March 2023, the centre-left LSDP secured a decisive victory against the parties of the ruling coalition. The party won the largest number of mayoralities (17 of 60) and a total of 375 seats in municipal councils, easily surpassing the TS-LKD, which at second place obtained 244 seats. The TS-LKD was successful in Vilnius, but regional political committees won the most votes in Lithuania’s four other largest cities, in another indication of widespread dissatisfaction toward political parties.</p>
          <p>On 22 May 2023 the TS-LKD, without consulting its coalition partners, called for snap parliamentary elections, and Prime Minister Ingrida Šimonytė announced that the Government would resign if Parliament refused the request. The proposal came in response to a growing scandal triggered by allegations that several Lithuanian politicians, including three cabinet ministers, had misused or misappropriated expenses while working as municipal councillors. Nevertheless, the demand for early elections received little support and was rejected by Parliament on June 6, and several days later Šimonytė retracted her threat.</p>
          <p>The frequent changes of government, the success of newly founded political parties in elections, the regular splintering of political parties, and the fact that no party has won the greatest share of votes in three consecutive elections could convey the impression of great volatility, if not instability, in Lithuanian politics. This impression is somewhat misleading. Governments have collapsed, but new coalitions have been formed quickly. Early parliamentary elections have been held only once, in 1992. Moreover, except for a short period in 2001, and in 2016-20, either the LSDP or the TS-LKD have dominated the governing coalitions. Newly created populist parties won the most votes in the parliamentary elections of 2000 and 2004, while the TPP was placed third in 2008. All have subsequently weakened, been dissolved or seem likely to become defunct.</p>
          <p>In 2018, however, the fragmentation of the party system seemed to gather pace. The LSDP, once the most stable party, split in March 2018, as dissenting LSDP members formed the breakaway Lietuvos Socialdemokratų Darbo Partija (LSDDP—Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party). The split had deleterious effects. The LSDDP failed to achieve the 5% threshold in the 2020 elections, while the LSDP managed to attract just 9.3% of the votes, its worst result in 20 years. The LVŽS became the leading left-of-centre party. The LRLS also splintered, as many leading members left the party, seeking to distance themselves from their indicted former leader, Eligijus Masiulis. In mid-2019 the LP was founded, and garnered 9.1% of vote in the national elections, outperforming the LRLS. Although the LRLS and LP are rivals, they remain ideological cousins and share a similar electorate. While public committees were a major force in municipal elections, they fared poorly at the national level.</p>
          <p>The basic features of Lithuania’s political landscape have changed little in more than 20 years. Most Lithuanians favour centre-left parties, which tend to win two consecutive elections before losing to the centre-right, which is then voted out of office after a single term. Despite occasionally fierce polemics, most political parties have similar views on the most important domestic and foreign policy issues, and generally follow the guidance of the EU and NATO; despite its populist proclivities even the LVŽS adopted policies that mirror the established consensus. No right-wing populist, radical nationalist, or Eurosceptic parties have managed to reach the 5% threshold for representation.</p>

          <heading>Foreign Relations</heading>
          <p id="LT.HI.P48">Following the re-establishment of independence, Lithuania prioritized integration into Western economic and security structures, while maintaining reasonably good links with Russia. There were changes in emphasis concerning the best means of implementing this policy, but a consensus supported by all major political forces had emerged by 1994.</p>
          <p id="LT.HI.P49">The Sąjūdis Government of the early 1990s insisted on its sovereign right to determine its foreign policy, and rejected Russian objections to its efforts to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) or any other international organization. It took some time to convince the left, in particular the LDDP, to assent to a clear Western orientation. On gaining power at the end of 1992, the LDDP sought to conduct what it called a `balanced’ foreign policy, which was, in effect, a tilt towards neutrality. However, Russia disregarded the LDDP’s conciliatory approach. In January 1994 the LDDP reversed its policy, and Lithuania became an active member of NATO’s Partnership for Peace programme. By 2002 Russia had accepted the inevitability of Lithuanian membership, although it continued to express reservations about NATO expansion. Lithuania officially joined NATO on 29 March 2004.</p>
          <p id="LT.HI.P50">Integration into Western organizations proceeded at a steady pace. In May 1993 Lithuania became a full member of the Council of Europe. Lithuania completed its accession negotiations with the EU in December 2002. In a referendum, held in May 2003, 90% of Lithuanians voted in favour of EU membership. Lithuania joined the Union in May 2004 and adopted the euro as its currency in January 2015.</p>
          <p id="LT.HI.P51">Lithuania embarked on an active foreign policy, seeking, successfully, to increase its international visibility. Not only did it assume the rotating Presidency of the Council of the EU in the second half of 2013, but it also held the Chairmanship of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe in 2012, and was a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council in 2014-15.</p>
          <p id="LT.HI.P52">In 2003 Lithuania played a prominent role in drafting the statement of the `Vilnius 10’, a loose grouping of post-communist states, expressing support for US policy towards Iraq. Subsequently, Lithuania sent a contingent of troops to serve in Iraq. More ambitiously, it agreed to head a provincial reconstruction team in Afghanistan, deployed in 2005, under the aegis of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force. Lithuanian troops were also sent to serve in Kosovo.</p>
          <p id="LT.HI.P53">Lithuania also expended substantial effort in strengthening the EU’s ties with its eastern neighbours through the Euro­pean Neighbourhood Policy and by urging that the prospect of EU membership be extended to participating countries. In late 2004 President Adamkus and his Polish counterpart, Aleksander Kwaśniewski, helped to mediate a peaceful solution to a political crisis in Ukraine, which had been triggered by a disputed presidential election there.</p>
          <p id="LT.HI.P54">Lithuania’s relations with Russia, which had been quite cordial, in part because of Lithuania’s decision to grant citizenship to all permanent residents, including ethnic Russians, deteriorated sharply during 2005-09, as Russia embarked on a more confrontational policy towards its neighbours, culminating in a brief war with Georgia in 2008. Lithuania became one of Russia’s fiercest critics, pushing the EU to formulate and implement a unified energy policy that would lessen dependence on Russian supplies of oil and natural gas. Lithuania was also an ardent supporter of continued NATO expansion, campaigning vigorously for an extension of NATO’s Membership Action Plan to both Georgia and Ukraine, and was Georgia’s most unequivocal champion in its conflict with Russia over South Ossetia.</p>
          <p id="LT.HI.P55">Although the TS-LKD in 2007 presented a plan for the `containment’ of Russia, it adopted a less confrontational stance upon taking power in 2008. A more measured approach was also initially favoured by President Grybauskaitė. Upon assuming office, she emphasized the importance of maintaining civil relations with Russia, focusing on the future rather than the past, co-ordinating policy with EU institutions and making greater use of the Union’s Eastern Neighbourhood Policy. Relations with Russia improved in 2010, as both Grybauskaitė and Prime Minister Kubilius met Vladimir Putin, then Russian premier (President in 2000-08 and from 2012). These were the first high-level bilateral meetings for more than six years. Numerous issues proved impervious to easy resolution, including Russia’s insistence that Lithuania abandon its demands for compensation for the effects of the Soviet occupation. Lithuania, in turn, convinced the European Commission to investigate what it termed the monopolistic operations of Russia’s state energy concern Gazprom.</p>
          <p id="LT.HI.P56">These disagreements paled in comparison with the tensions generated in March 2014 by Russia’s annexation of the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine and its subsequent support of an insurgency in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. Lithuania became the fiercest critic in the EU of Russian foreign policy. Grybauskaitė repeatedly described Russia as a `terrorist’ state, urging the EU to impose more punitive sanctions and to provide military assistance to Ukraine. Lithuania was the first EU state to supply armaments to Ukraine. In April 2016 the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, asserted that Lithuania had become what he termed the most `Russophobic’ Baltic state. Fearing Russian aggression, Lithuania appealed for the permanent stationing of NATO troops in the Baltic states and Poland. In response, Russia reinforced its western and southern flanks with three new military divisions, and deployed advanced weaponry, including advanced nuclear-capable Iskander missiles, to its Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad Oblast, which borders Lithuania. Although during the 2019 presidential election campaign Nausėda suggested that Lithuania should temper its strident anti-Russian rhetoric, the Lithuanian Government continued to criticize the perceived mildness of the EU sanctions targeting Russia.</p>
          <p>Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 was met with massive international support for Ukraine. Lithuania called for immediate and heavy sanctions against Russia and Belarus (which had facilitated the invasion), sent humanitarian and military support to Ukraine, and urged other countries to provide assistance. On 4 April Lithuania became the first EU state to downgrade its diplomatic ties with Russia, ordering the expulsion of its ambassador, and to halt all imports of Russian gas. On 10 May Parliament unanimously adopted a resolution declaring Russia `a terrorist state’ and denouncing the Russian invasion of Ukraine as `genocide against the Ukrainian people’. The Lithuanian Government has called for the imposition of ever greater sanctions against Russia and careful monitoring to prevent their circumvention. It has constantly insisted that Ukraine be provided with the most modern weapons, including F-16 fighter jets, and in large numbers. The Government fully supports Ukraine’s demands that any peace treaty must lead to the withdrawal of Russian troops from all of Ukraine, including Crimea, massive reparations and the establishment of an international tribunal to try Russian leaders for war crimes. In advance of a NATO summit hosted in Vilnius in July 2023, Lithuania urged the Alliance to adopt a forward-based defensive strategy, commit all members to a minimum defence budget of 2% of GDP, and extend a plan for NATO membership to Ukraine.</p>
          <p>In June 2022 Germany made a commitment to lead `a combat-ready brigade’ in Lithuania, replacing the German-led NATO battalion that has been deployed on a rotational basis in Lithuania since 2017. However, the exact nature of the deployment has caused strong disagreement. Lithuania insists that the full brigade be permanently stationed in the country once the infrastructure is in place in 2026, while Germany maintains that part of the brigade should be based in Lithuania and the rest in Germany, ready to deploy to Lithuania in 10 days if necessary. German Minister of Defence Boris Pistorius has suggested that the decision on the permanent deployment of a German brigade to Lithuania be made by NATO. </p>
          <p id="LT.HI.P57">Lithuania’s relations with Belarus reached a nadir in early 2022, owing to Belarusian support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Previously, they fluctuated, primarily in response to the repressive internal policies of President Alyaksandr Lukashenka’s Government. Periods of diplomatic engagement were followed by periods of distancing, usually after the Belarusian Government’s repression of demonstrators protesting against election results in that country. Lithuania initially favoured a policy of cautious engagement, even adopting the role of mediator between the Belarusian Government and the EU in the early 2000s, and urging the West to enter into a critical dialogue with Belarus in the hope of inducing President Lukashenka to assert his nation’s sovereignty by loosening ties with Russia. While engaging with Lukashenka, Lithuania allowed political opponents of the Government of Belarus to reside in Vilnius and permitted the transfer of the European Humanities University from the Belarusian capital, Minsk, to Vilnius in 2005, following its closure by the Belarusian authorities.</p>
          <p>In the first years of her presidency Grybauskaitė attempted to improve Lithuanian-Belarusian relations. She met Lukashenka when he made an unofficial visit to attend a bilateral economic forum in Vilnius in September 2009 (his first visit to Lithuania in 12 years), and visited Minsk in October 2010 to urge Lukashenka to conduct the forthcoming parliamentary elections in accordance with democratic standards. The repressive measures taken by the Belarusian authorities against demonstrators protesting against the results of the elections on 19 December led to a reimposition of sanctions against Belarusian officials. In part because of the importance of trade with Belarus, the Lithuanian Government urged the EU to ensure that the sanctions targeted Lukashenka and his circle rather than the Belarusian population at large.</p>
          <p>Grybauskaitė, however, remained sceptical of these efforts, convinced that Western blandishments would not affect Belarus’s domestic and foreign policy. Nausėda suggested that Lithuania adopt a more accommodating policy, but made only tentative steps for fear of domestic criticism. The situation changed radically after the contested Belarusian presidential election of August 2020, when mass protests erupted after results showed a victory for Lukashenka. Responding to widespread reports of the falsification of results and the brutal suppression of demonstrators, the Lithuanian Government granted refuge to the leading opposition candidate Svyatlana Tsikhanouskaya, as well as other Belarusians fleeing persecution, recalled its ambassador from Minsk and urged the EU to impose sanctions. In turn, Belarus accused Lithuania of interfering in its internal affairs and permitting NATO troops to mass on its western border. Relations deteriorated further in 2021, when the Belarusian Government orchestrated a surge of illegal migrants, around two-thirds of whom originated from Iraq, into Lithuania (and neighbouring Latvia and Poland). After more than 4,000 migrants had crossed the border by early August, the Lithuanian authorities began to force them back into Belarus and constructed a 4-m-high, barbed-wire barrier along the entire joint border. Lukashenka’s support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 led Lithuania to demand even stronger economic sanctions and the diplomatic isolation of Belarus.</p>
          <p id="LT.HI.P59">Another major issue of contention with Belarus has been the construction by Belarus of two nuclear power plants at Astraverts (Ostrovets), near to the Lithuanian border and around 50 km from Vilnius. Lithuania objected vigorously to the project, questioning the ability of Belarus to ensure the safety of the nuclear reactors. The Lithuanian Government called for international, as well as EU, inspection of the reactors under construction, and urged neighbouring states not to buy electricity from the plant. Although Germany and other EU states have acknowledged Lithuania’s concerns, they are not in a position to halt the construction of the reactors, the first of which commenced operations in November 2020. In April 2023 Belarus commenced the process of launching the second unit, which was connected to the power grid in May and scheduled to be commissioned later that year. The Lithuanian Government protested vigorously and urged that no action be taken until all nuclear safety issues identified by international missions and review processes have been addressed.</p>
          <p>Lithuania gained a new enemy in China, when it allowed Taiwan to open a Representative Office, in effect a de facto embassy (although the Lithuanian Government denied that it had diplomatic status), in Vilnius in November 2021—the first in Europe to bear the name `Taiwan’, rather than `Taipei’. The Chinese Government declared the decision a `clear breach’ of its `One China’ policy and began to prevent Lithuanian goods from entering its territory, as well as imports from EU countries if they contained components from Lithuania. It also reduced its diplomatic relations with Lithuania to the level of chargé d’affaires. Both the USA and the EU expressed their support for Lithuania, but China has not signalled any intention of easing its stance. In January 2023 the World Trade Organization agreed to requests by the EU for the establishment of a dispute panel to examine Chinese measures affecting trade in goods and services with Lithuania.</p>
          <p id="LT.HI.P60">Lithuania placed special importance on further improving its relations with Poland, a country with which it had strong, if not always cordial, historical links. In 1997 joint councils at presidential, governmental and parliamentary levels were established to resolve emerging problems and broaden the range of co-operative ventures. Co-operation between the two countries, particularly in the trade and energy sectors, subsequently grew substantially. In 2010-12, however, relations deteriorated sharply as Poland accused Lithu­ania of discriminating against its Polish minority by not permitting the use of the Polish alphabet in official documents or in bilingual street signs in areas where Poles make up a large part of the population. A law on education that demanded that more subjects be taught in Lithuanian at Polish-language schools was particularly contentious. The involvement of some senior politicians in the polemics led to expressions of concern and demands for moderation. Both countries have de-escalated their rhetoric since Russia’s annexation of Crimea. Although the fundamental issues fuelling the bilateral disputes have not been resolved fully, relations improved markedly in 2018, following an exchange of visits by the premiers and parliamentary chairmen of the two countries. In February 2019 the Polish-Lithuanian Parliamentary Assembly met for the first time in 10 years. Both countries committed themselves to greater co-operation in energy and defence policy, cemented by 16 high-level bilateral visits during 2019. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has further strengthened co-operation in defence and security matters.</p>
          <p id="LT.HI.P61">Lithuania’s relations with Estonia and Latvia have been reinforced by the development of an institutional structure to ensure Baltic co-operation. Regular meetings at the presidential, governmental and parliamentary levels helped to overcome some misunderstandings, but frequent disagreements concerning energy and transportation projects remain the rule, rather than the exception. Despite frequently expressed support for increased and deepening Baltic co-operation, relations remain cordial rather than close. </p>
          <p id="LT.HI.P62">Lithuania also has close relations with the Nordic countries, especially Sweden and Denmark, both of which have actively supported the Lithuanian cause in European forums. Lithuania participates in wider regional initiatives; it was a founding member of the Council of the Baltic Sea States in 1992, and assumed its presidency in 1999.</p>
          <p id="LT.HI.P63">Lithuania has excellent ties with the USA, which it considers to be its most important ally and the principal guarantor of its independence. During disagreements between the USA and the EU, particularly with regard to security issues, Lithuania instinctively and consistently supports US policies.</p>
          <p id="LT.HI.P64">Despite occasional complaints regarding the growth of foreign influence, and restraints on the country’s sovereignty, Lithuania’s political elite and the majority of its population believe that NATO guarantees the country’s national security, while its membership of the EU ensures conditions for domestic prosperity. The highest priority is granted to forging the closest possible ties with the USA, ensuring maximum support for Ukraine, while subjecting Russia to the most comprehensive and deleterious sanctions and isolating it on the world stage. The benefits of cordial, if not close, ties with neighbouring states are widely recognized, but Lithuania’s relations with Russia and Belarus are unlikely to be repaired for decades.</p>
