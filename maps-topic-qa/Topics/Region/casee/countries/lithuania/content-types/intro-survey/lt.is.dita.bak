               <p id="LT.IS.3">The Republic of Lithuania is situated on the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea, in north-eastern Europe. It is bounded by Latvia to the north, by Belarus to the south-east, by Poland to the south-west and by the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad Oblast to the west. Lithu­ania’s maritime position moderates an otherwise continental-type climate. Temperatures range from an average of −4.9°C (23.2°F) in January to a July mean of 17.0°C (62.6°F). Rainfall levels vary considerably from region to region: in the far west the annual average is 700 mm-­850 mm (28 ins-33 ins), but in the central plain it is about 600 mm (24 ins). The official language is Lithuanian. The predominant religion is Christianity. Most ethnic Lithuanians are Latin-rite Catholics, but there are small communities of Lutherans and Calvinists and other Protestants. Adherents of Russian Orthodoxy are almost exclusively ethnic Slavs, while most Tatars have retained an adherence to Islam. The national flag (proportions 3 by 5) consists of three equal horizontal stripes of yellow (top), green and red (bottom). The capital is Vilnius.</p>

                    <heading>Historical Context</heading>
                    <p id="LT.IS.5">Prior to annexation by the Russian Empire in 1795, Lithuania was united in a Commonwealth with Poland. In 1915, after the outbreak of the First World War, it was occupied by German troops. A Lithuanian Conference’ was convened in September 1917, which elected a Lithuanian Council’, led by Antanas Smetona; it declared independence on 16 February 1918. Soviet Russia recognized Lithu­anian independence in the Treaty of Moscow, signed in July 1920. In October Poland annexed the region of Vilnius but was forced to recognize the rest of Lithuania as an independent state. Lithuania’s first Constitution, which declared Lithuania a parliamentary democracy, was adopted in August 1922. In December 1926 Smetona seized power in a military coup, establishing an authoritarian regime that lasted until 1940.</p>
                    <p id="LT.IS.6">The Nazi-Soviet Treaty on Friendship and Existing Borders, agreed in September 1939 (following the outbreak of the Second World War), permitted the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) to take control of Lithuania. In October Lithuania was compelled to agree to the stationing of 20,000 Soviet troops on its territory. In return, the USSR granted the city and region of Vilnius (which Soviet troops had seized in September) to Lithuania. In June 1940 the USSR dispatched a further 100,000 troops to Lithuania, and a Soviet-approved People’s Government was formed. Elections to a People’s Seim (parliament), which only pro-Soviet candidates were permitted to contest, took place in July. The parliament proclaimed the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic on 21 July, and on 3 August it formally became a Union Republic of the USSR. The Nazi occupation of Lithuania (1941-44) was followed by the return of the Soviet Army in 1944, and anti-Soviet partisan warfare continued until 1952. Political parties were disbanded, and political power became the exclusive preserve of the Lietuvos Komunistų Partija (LKP—Communist Party of Lithuania), the local branch of the Kommunisticheskaya Partiya Sovetskogo Soyuza (KPSS—Communist Party of the Soviet Union).</p>
                    <p id="LT.IS.8">In February 1988 security forces were deployed to prevent the public celebration of the 70th anniversary of Lithuanian independence. This, together with frustration with the slow pace of reform, led to the establishment in June of the Lithuanian Movement for Reconstruction (Sąjūdis). Sąjūdis organized mass demonstrations to protest against the suppression of national culture and russification’. In accordance with the demands of Sąjūdis, in November the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet (Supreme Council—legislature) recognized Lithuanian as the state language, and traditional Lithuanian state symbols were restored.</p>
                    <p id="LT.IS.9">Sąjūdis won 36 of the 42 popularly elected Lithuanian seats at elections to the all-Union Congress of People’s Deputies in March 1989. In May the LKP-dominated Supreme Soviet approved a declaration of Lithuanian sovereignty, asserting the supremacy of Lithuania’s laws over all-Union legislation. Despite denunciations of Baltic nationalism by the all-Union authorities, the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet continued to adopt reformist legislation, including the establishment of freedom of religion and the legalization of a multi-party system. In December the LKP declared itself independent of the KPSS, declaring support for multi-party democracy and independent statehood. Meanwhile, Algirdas Brazauskas, the First Secretary of the LKP, was elected Chairman of the Presidium of the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet. However, Sąjūdis won an overall majority in the elections to the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet in February-March 1990. This new, pro-independence parliament elected Vytautas Landsbergis, the Chairman of Sąjūdis, to replace Brazauskas as its Chairman (de facto President of Lithuania) and on 11 March declared the restoration of Lithuanian independence: Lithuania thus became the first of the Soviet republics to make such a declaration. Kazimiera Danutė Prunskienė, a member of the LKP and hitherto a Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, was appointed Prime Minister.</p>

                    <heading>Domestic Political Affairs</heading>
                    <p id="LT.IS.11">A special session of the all-Union Congress of People’s Deputies condemned the Lithuanian declarations as unconstitutional, and Soviet forces occupied LKP buildings in Vilnius. Following the imposition of an economic embargo against Lithuania in April 1990, a six-month moratorium on the inde­pendence declaration was agreed in June. However, the Soviet Government soon terminated formal negotiations, which began in August, and in January 1991 Landsbergis revoked the suspension of the declaration of independence. Subsequently, the Soviet authorities dispatched troops to Vilnius, which occupied former KPSS properties that had been nationalized by the Lithuanian Government. Lands­bergis mobilized popular support to help to defend the parliament building. On 13 January a total of 14 people were killed when Soviet troops seized the broadcasting centre in Vilnius. (In August 1999 six former officers of the KPSS-affiliated LKP faction were convicted of complicity in attempts to overthrow the Lithuanian Government in January 1991 and sentenced to terms of imprisonment.)</p>
                    <p id="LT.IS.12">Meanwhile, earlier in January 1991 Prunskienė and her Council of Ministers had resigned. Gediminas Vagnorius, a member of the Supreme Council, was appointed Prime Minister. At a referendum in February 90.5% of voters expressed support for the re-establishment of an independent Lithuania and for the withdrawal of the Soviet army from the republic. In common with five other Soviet republics, Lithuania refused to conduct the all-Union referendum on the future of the USSR, which was held in March.</p>
                    <p id="LT.IS.13">
          During the seizure of power in Moscow, the Russian and Soviet capital, by the conservative communist `State Committee for the State of Emergency’ in August 1991, Soviet military vehicles entered Vilnius; an emergency session of the Supreme Council condemned the putschists. As the coup collapsed the Lithuanian Government ordered the withdrawal of Soviet forces from the republic and banned the KPSS-affiliated LKP. The failed coup prompted the recognition of Lithuanian independence by other states, and on 6 September the USSR State Council recognized the independence of Lithuania along with that of Estonia and Latvia. All three countries were admitted to the United Nations (UN) and the Conference on (now Organization for) Security and Co-operation in Europe (

          ) later in the month.
        </p>
                    <p id="LT.IS.14">During the first half of 1992 there was an increasing polarity within the Supreme Council between Sąjūdis deputies and those of the mainly left-wing opposition parties, most prominently the official successor party to the LKP, the Lietuvos Demokratinė Darbo Partija (LDDP—Lithu­anian Democratic Labour Party), led by Brazauskas. Vag­nor­ius tendered his resignation as Prime Minister in May. In July the Supreme Council appointed Aleksandras Abišala, a close associate of Landsbergis, as Prime Minister of a new Government.</p>
                    <p id="LT.IS.15">The LDDP emerged as the leading party in elections to the Seimas (Parliament—as the Supreme Council had been renamed), held on 25 October and 15 November 1992, winning 73 of the total 141 seats, while an alliance of Sąjūdis and the Citizens’ Charter of Lithuania secured 30 seats. The Lietuvos Krikščionių Demokratų Partija (LKDP—Christian Democratic Party of Lithuania), which was closely aligned with Sąjūdis, won 16 seats. A referendum held alongside the first round of the elections approved a new Constitution, which was adopted by the Parliament on 6 November. Pending an election to the new post of President of the Republic, Brazauskas was elected by the Parliament as its Chairman and acting Head of State. In December Brazauskas appointed Bronislovas Lubys as Prime Minister. Lubys formed a new coalition Council of Ministers.</p>
                    <p id="LT.IS.16">Brazauskas won the presidential election on 14 February 1993, with some 60% of the votes cast. He subsequently resigned from the LDDP. Adolfas Šleževičius succeeded Lubys as Prime Minister in March and was appointed Chairman of the LDDP in April. In May a new political organization, the conservative Tėvynės Sąjunga (TS—Homeland Union), was formed. Mainly comprising former members of Sąjūdis, and chaired by Landsbergis, the TS rapidly became the principal opposition party.</p>
                    <p id="LT.IS.18">In January 1996 it was revealed that Šleževičius had withdrawn funds from the Lithuanian Joint Stock Innovation Bank, shortly before the bank’s operations had been suspended on grounds of insolvency. Subsequently, the Minister of the Interior and the Chairman of the central bank resigned. Šleževičius was replaced as Prime Minister by Laurynas Mindaugas Stankevičius in February. Šleževičius also resigned as Chairman of the LDDP and was succeeded by Česlovas Juršėnas, the Chairman of the Parliament.</p>
                    <p id="LT.IS.19">A general election took place on 20 October and 10 November 1996. The ruling LDDP won only 12 seats. The TS obtained 70 seats, and the LKDP 16. The right-wing Lietuvos Centro Sąjunga (LCS—Centre Union of Lithuania) won 13 seats and the Lietuvos Socialdemokratų Partija (LSDP—Lithuanian Social Democratic Party) 12. The rate of participation was 53% in the first round, and about 40% in the second. In late November Landsbergis was elected Chairman of the Parliament, and the Parliament approved the appointment of Vagnorius as Prime Minister of a TS-led coalition Government.</p>

                         <heading>Valdas Adamkus Elected as President</heading>
                         <p id="LT.IS.20">In a second round of voting at the presidential election held on 4 January 1998, Valdas Adamkus (who had been naturalized in the USA) narrowly defeated Artūras Paulauskas (the deputy Prosecutor-General, supported by Lietuvos Liberalų Sąjunga—LLS—the Lithuanian Liberal Union), with 50.4% of the votes. In April Paulauskas announced the formation of a new, centre-left political party, Naujoji Sąjunga—Socialliberalai (NS, the New Union—Social Liberals).</p>
                         <p id="LT.IS.21">Dissent between the President and Prime Minister intensified in April 1999, and at the end of the month Vagnorius announced his resignation. In May Adamkus invited the Mayor of Vilnius, Rolandas Paksas (of the TS), to form a new coalition Government, comprising mainly representatives of the TS and the LKDP. In October the Council of Ministers endorsed an agreement to sell a stake in the state-owned Mažeikiai Nafta pet­roleum refinery to a US oil company, despite opposition from Paksas. The decision prompted the resignations of the Ministers of National Economy and of Finance and subsequently of Paksas.</p>
                         <p id="LT.DIR.2121212">At the end of October 1999 Adamkus nominated Andrius Kubilius as Prime Minister. The new Council of Ministers was largely unchanged. After the leader of the LCS, Romualdas Ozolas, resigned as a Deputy Chairman of the Parliament, the party went into opposition. Having resigned from the TS in the previous month, Paksas was elected Chairman of the LLS in December. Local elections in March 2000 resulted in successes for parties of the left, most notably the NS. A decline in support for the TS was followed by a split in the party, thus depriving the TS-LKDP coalition of a parliamentary majority. In May the LSDP and the LDDP, together with two smaller parties, agreed to contest forthcoming legislative elections as the A. Brazausko Socialdemokratinė Koalicija (SDK—A. Brazauskas Social Demo­cratic Coalition), after the former President.</p>
                         <p id="LT.IS.23">A total of 56.2% of eligible voters participated in legislative elections held on 8 October 2000, at which the TS won nine seats. Although the SDK obtained the largest representation, with 51 seats, the LLS and the NS (with 34 and 29 seats, respectively) signed a coalition agreement, forming a parliamentary majority with partners including the LCS. The new Council of Ministers, led by Paksas, was approved in October; Paulauskas was elected Chairman of the Parliament. The LDDP merged with the LSDP in January 2001. The LSDP thereby became the largest single party in the Parliament, and Brazauskas was elected its Chairman.</p>
                         <p id="LT.IS.25">In June 2001 the six NS members of the Council of Ministers resigned, following disagreements with the LLS over economic reform. Paksas was unable to form a new coalition and resigned on 20 June. After the NS sought a new alliance with the LSDP, President Adamkus offered the post of Prime Minister to Brazauskas, who was confirmed in office on 3 July. The LSDP agreed to an informal accord, which granted the NS the same six ministerial positions from which it had withdrawn in June. In September Paksas resigned as Chairman of the LLS and was replaced by Eugenijus Gentvilas. In December Paksas and 10 other deputies left the parliamentary faction of the LLS; they formed the rightist Liberalų Demokratų Partij (LDP—Liberal Democratic Party) in March 2002, with Paksas as its Chairman.</p>
                         <p id="LT.IS.267">In a second round of presidential voting, on 5 January 2003, Paksas obtained 54.7% of the votes cast, defeating Adamkus. Paksas was inaugurated on 26 February. In March Brazauskas was reappointed as Prime Minister; his Council of Ministers was substantially unchanged. Following the presidential election, Paksas resigned as Chairman of the LDP, and Valentinas Mazuronis was elected as his successor. In May the LCS, the LLS and the MKD merged to form the Liberalų Centro Sąjunga (LCS—Liberal and Centre Union).</p>

                         <p id="LT.IS.56">In October 2003 a classified report was disclosed, which claimed to provide evidence of links between the presidential adviser on national security and Yurii Borisov, an ethnic Russian with alleged connections to organized crime groups, who had contributed funds to Paksas’s presidential election campaign. It was revealed that Paksas had signed a presidential decree permitting Borisov to hold dual citizenship. In December a parliamentary resolution to initiate impeachment proceedings against Paksas was adopted, after a special parliamentary commission concluded that the President’s conduct had jeopardized national security. In March 2004 the Constitutional Court ruled that the President had violated the Constitution by granting Borisov dual citizenship in exchange for financial support, failing to protect state secrets and using his presidential office illegally to influence the actions of a company’s shareholders. Paksas was removed from office in April, after the necessary three-fifths’ majority in the Parliament supported his impeachment. Paulauskas assumed the presidency in an acting capacity, pending a pres­idential election. In May the Constitutional Court ruled that legislation recently approved by the Parliament, preventing an impeached head of state from seeking office, was in accordance with the Constitution, and Paksas was obliged to withdraw his candidacy from the forthcoming presidential election.</p>
                         <p id="LT.IS.233211342">
            In a second round of presidential voting on 27 June 2004, Adamkus was narrowly elected to the presidency, receiving 52.6% of the votes cast, defeating Prunskienė. Meanwhile, Lithuania’s first elections to the European Parliament, following Lithuania’s admission to the 
            <xr pageref="Y" ref="WB02047.IO.TXT">European Union (EU)</xr>
             on 1 May, had been held concurrently with the first round of presidential voting on 13 June, with the participation of 46% of the electorate. The recently founded Darbo Partija (DP—Labour Party), led by ethnic Russian business executive Viktor Uspaskikh, won five of the country’s 13 mandates; the governing LSDP, the LCS and the TS each obtained two seats, while the LDP and the Valstiečių ir Naujosios Demokratijos Partijų Sąjungos (VNDS—Peasants’ and New Democracy Union), led by Prunskienė, each won one seat. Adamkus was inaugurated on 12 July, and on the following day the Parliament approved his nomination of Brazauskas as Prime Minister.

                         <p id="LT.IS.231243613252">Following legislative elections on 10 and 24 October 2004, the DP became the largest single party in the Parliament, obtaining 39 of the 141 elective seats. A coalition of the LSDP and the NS received 31 seats, followed by the TS, with 25 seats, the LCS, with 18, an LDP-led coalition, with 11, and the VNDS, with 10. In December the Parliament approved a coalition Government of the DP, the LSDP, the NS and the VNDS, led again by Brazauskas. In December the Supreme Court cleared Paksas of divulging confidential state information, while Borisov was granted permission to remain resident in Lithuania.</p>

                         <p>In May 2006 seven DP deputies defected to the newly reconstituted Pilietinės Demokratijos Partija (PDP—Civil Democracy Party). Uspaskikh, the subject of corruption allegations, tendered his resignation as Chairman of the DP later in May. At the end of May the DP withdrew from the ruling coalition, effectively forcing the resignation of the Council of Ministers. In July the Parliament approved the nomination of Gediminas Kirkilas, Vice-Chairman of the LSDP, as Prime Minister. The new Council of Ministers comprised members of the LSDP, the Lietuvos Valstiečių Liaudininkų Sajunga (LVLS—Lithuanian Peasant Nationalists’ Union, formerly the VNDS), the PDP and the LCS.</p>
                         <p>Zigmantas Balčytis resigned as Minister of Finance in March 2007, after a trial revealed misconduct by his son while working at a state agency responsible for the distribution of EU funds; Balčytis was replaced by Rimantas Šadžius, also of the LSDP. In May Prime Minister Kirkilas was elected Chairman of the LSDP, following the resignation of Brazauskas. In September Uspaskikh returned to Lithuania from Russia (where he had been since August 2006) and was subsequently placed under house arrest. Having been re-elected Chairman of the DP in November 2007, Uspaskikh was released on bail in April 2008.</p>
                         <p>In January 2008 an agreement was signed on the expansion of the ruling coalition to include the NS, thereby giving it a majority in the Parliament, with 73 seats. Later in that month NS Chairman Paulauskas joined the Government as Minister of the Environment. Juršėnas of the LSDP was elected Chairman of the Parliament at the beginning of April. The TS merged with the LKDP in May, to form the Tėvynės Sąjunga-Lietuvos Krikščionys Demokratai (TS-LKD—Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats). Also in that month the Tautos Prisikėlimo Partija (TPP—National Revival Party) was established by television presenter Arūnas Valinskas.</p>
                         <p>The TS-LKD became the largest party in the Parliament following legislative elections, held on 12 and 26 October 2008, winning 45 of the 141 seats. The LSDP took 25 seats, followed by the TPP, with 16, and the Partijos Tvarka ir Teisingumas (TT—Order and Justice Party), with 15. The Lietuvos Respublikos Liberalų Sąjūdis (LRLS—Liberal Movement of the Republic of Lithuania), which had been formed by a breakaway group of the LCS, secured 11 seats, while a DP-led coalition took 10, and the LCS won eight. The rate of participation by the electorate was 48.6% in the first round and 32.4% in the second. In late October President Adamkus invited the Chairman of the TS-LKD, Kubilius, to form a government. Uspaskikh was elected to Parliament, but in December the legislature voted to remove his immunity from prosecution. In late November the Parliament approved the nomination of Kubilius as Prime Minister, to lead a four-party coalition Government controlling 80 seats in the Parliament. The TS-LKD assumed responsibility for the economy, finance and national defence portfolios in the new Council of Ministers, which took office in December.</p>

                         <p>Dalia Grybauskaitė, hitherto a European Commissioner, was elected as President of Lithuania in a first round of voting on 17 May 2009, receiving 69.1% of the votes cast. Her nearest rival was Butkevičius, who had succeeded Kirkilas as Chairman of the LSDP, with 11.8%. The rate of electoral participation was 51.7%. Grybauskaitė took office on 12 July. In the same month Ingrida Šimonytė was appointed Minister of Finance. Meanwhile, elections to the European Parliament were conducted on 7 June, with the participation of 21.0% of the electorate. The TS-LKD won four of the country’s 12 seats, the LSDP three, and the TT two, while the DP (which had previously held five seats), the Akcja Wyborcza Polaków na Litwie (AWPL—Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania) and the LRLS each obtained one seat.

                         <p>Elections to the Parliament were conducted on 14 and 28 October 2012. The parties of the ruling coalition led by the TS-LKD received 36 seats, registering a significant loss in support, while the LSDP’s representation increased to 34 seats, and that of the DP (which had absorbed the NS) to 30 seats; the LRLS took 11 seats, the TT 10, and the AWPL nine. An anti-corruption party, Drąsos Kelias (The Way of Courage), won seven seats. One representative of the Lietuvos Valstiečių ir Žaliųjų Sąjunga (LVŽS—Lithuanian Peasants’ and Greens’ Union—formerly the LVLS) was elected, as were two independents. A proposal by LSDP Chairman Butkevičius that his party form a ruling coalition with the DP was initially refused by President Grybauskaitė, on the grounds that Uspaskikh and other members of the DP remained under investigation for tax evasion. On 19 November, however, Grybauskaitė conceded that only the LSDP was able to form a government coalition with a parliamentary majority. Butkevičius was appointed Prime Minister on 7 December, and his new Government, comprising members of the LSDP, the DP, the TT and the AWPL, secured the approval of the Parliament on 12 December.</p>
                         <p>In July 2013 Uspaskikh was sentenced to four years’ imprisonment by Vilnius Regional Court, after being convicted in connection with fraudulent DP financial accounts, together with the DP leader, Vytautas Gapšys, and other senior party officials. In October the Chairman of the Parliament, Loreta Graužinienė, succeeded Gapšys as leader of the DP.</p>
                         <p>Grybauskaitė received 46.6% of the votes cast in the first round of a presidential election on 11 May 2014, while Balčytis obtained 13.8%. In the second round on 25 May, Grybauskaitė secured 59.1% of the votes, winning a second term of office. In concurrent elections to the European Parliament on 25 May, the TS-LKD, the LSDP, the LRLS and the TT each won two seats, and the DP, the AWPL and the LVŽS each secured one seat. Grybauskaitė was inaugurated on 12 July and approved a new coalition Government, again led by Butkevičius and largely unchanged from the previous administration, on the following day.</p>
                         <p>Meanwhile, further amendments to Lithuania’s municipal election law were adopted in July 2014, under which mayors were henceforth to be elected directly, rather than appointed by political parties. Municipal polls, including the country’s first direct mayoral elections, duly took place on 1 March 2015, with a second round on 15 March. Remigijus Šimašius of the LRLS was elected Mayor of Vilnius.</p>

                         <p>The first round of the legislative elections took place on 9 October 2016, with a second round on 23 October. The LVŽS increased its representation in the Parliament from just one seat to 54, followed by the TS-LKD, with 31 seats, and the former ruling LSDP, which had experienced a significant loss of support, with 17 seats, compared with 34 in 2012; the LRLS secured 14 seats. The success of the LVŽS was attributed to the popularity of its leader, business magnate Ramūnas Karbauskis, in conjunction with the corruption allegations surrounding the government parties. The rate of participation by the electorate was 50.6% in the first round and 38.0% in the second. Former Minister of the Interior Saulius Skvernelis of the LVŽS was selected as the consensus candidate for Prime Minister and was appointed to the office by President Grybauskaitė on 22 November. His new Government, which was approved by the Parliament on 13 December, largely comprised independent ministers, and LSDP representatives Linas Linkevičius and Mindaugas Sinkevičius were allocated the foreign affairs and the economy portfolios, respectively.</p>
                         <p>In June 2017 the Parliament voted to open impeachment proceedings against a prominent member of the LSDP and former parliamentary Deputy Chairman, Mindaugas Bastys, who was suspected of working in support of the interests of Russia. Following increasing dissent between the government parties, in September the LSDP withdrew from the ruling coalition. Minister of Foreign Affairs Linkevičius left the LSDP and remained in his government post as an independent. Although the Constitutional Court concluded in December that Bastys had violated the Constitution, a vote in the Parliament on 13 March 2018 failed to approve his impeachment. On the following day Bastys nevertheless resigned his parliamentary mandate. Meanwhile, following a split in the LSDP, in April Kirkilas established the breakaway Lietuvos Socialdemokratų Darbo Partija (LSDDP—Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party).</p>

                         <heading>Election of President Gitanas Nausėda</heading>
                         <p>In October 2018 the Parliament voted in favour of organizing a referendum on dual citizenship concurrently with the next presidential election, which was scheduled for 12 May 2019. Municipal elections were conducted on 3 March, when an official participation rate of 47.8% was recorded. At the first round of voting in the presidential election on 12 May, which was contested by nine candidates, Šimonytė of the TS-LKD received 31.3% of the votes cast, narrowly ahead of economist Gitanas Nausėda, an independent, with 30.9%; premier Skvernelis of the LVŽS secured 19.6% of the votes. Voter turnout was recorded at 57.4%. At the concurrent referendum, a proposal to allow dual citizenship with certain countries was supported by 73.9% of those participating, but was unsuccessful, as the required approval of at least 50% of registered voters had not been reached. In the second round of voting between the two leading presidential candidates on 26 May, Nausėda was elected as President with 65.7% of the votes cast. The rate of participation by the electorate in the second round was 53.9%.</p>
                         <p>Elections to the European Parliament also took place on 26 May 2019, in which the TS-LKD emerged as the leading party, with three seats. The LSDP and the LVŽS each won two seats, and the DP, the LRLS and the Lietuvos Lenkų Rinkimų Akcija-Krikščioniškų Šeimų Sąjunga (LLRA-KŠS—Electoral Action of Lithuanian Poles-Christian Families Alliance) each secured one, as did a candidate supported by a public election committee.</p>
                         <p>
            The LVŽS, the LSDDP, the LLRA-KŠS and the TT signed a new coalition agreement on 5 July 2019. Nausėda was sworn in as President on 12 July. Six days later he nominated Skvernelis to continue in the office of Prime Minister.

            In August Nausėda approved a reorganized Government with three new ministers, including Rita Tamašunienę, a LLRA-KŠS representative, as Minister of the Interior.
          </p>
                         <p>In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in February 2020 the Lithuanian Government declared a preventive state of emergency. The authorities imposed a nationwide quarantine in March. The state of quarantine was subsequently extended until June, although some restrictions were eased from April. A national vaccination programme commenced in December.</p>

                         <p>Legislative elections took place on 11 and 25 October 2020, resulting in victory for the TS-LKD, which secured a total of 50 seats. The LVŽS won 32 seats (representing a loss of 22); the LSDP and the LRLS each obtained 13 seats, the Laisvės Partija (LP—Freedom Party—formed in 2019 by breakaway members of the LRLS) 11, and the DP 10. Amid the ongoing pandemic, the rate of participation by the electorate was 47.8% in the first round, falling to 39.0% in the second.</p>
                         <p>
            On 9 November 2020 the TS-LKD, the LP and the LRLS reached a coalition agreement, and four days later Viktorija Čmilytė-Nielsen, the leader of the LRLS, was elected as Chairman of the Parliament. The three parties nominated Šimonytė as Prime Minister, who was confirmed in office by the Parliament on 24 November. Her Government was approved by the Parliament on 11 December. Principal new ministers included Aušrinė Armonaitė, the Chairman of the LP, as Minister of the Economy and Innovation and TS-LKD Chairman Gabrielius Landsbergis as Minister of Foreign Affairs. Meanwhile, following a resurgence in cases of COVID-19, a further nationwide quarantine was imposed from 7 November, 
            <!--https://www.themayor.eu/en/a/view/lithuania-leaves-8-month-lockdown-behind-8328-->

            Minister of Foreign Affairs Landsbergis and the Minister of Transport and Communications, Marius Skuodis, offered their resignations in December 2021, after it emerged that potash fertilizer shipments from Belarusian state-owned manufacturer Belaruskali continued to transit Lithuania under a previous contract between Lithuanian Railways and Belaruskali, despite the imposition of increased EU and US sanctions against Belarus (following events in that country from August 2020—see 
            <i>Foreign Affairs</i>
            ). However, Prime Minister Šimonytė retained Landsbergis and Skuodis in office, although the head of Lithuanian Railways resigned. In January 2022 the Government announced the termination (from February) of the railway contract on the transportation of Belarusian potash, on the grounds that it was contrary to Lithuania’s national security interests.

                         <heading>Recent Developments: Government Tensions</heading>
                         <p>In response to the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, President Nausėda declared a nationwide state of emergency, allowing additional funding for security and the reinforcement of state border protection. On the same day the Parliament approved unanimously the state of emergency and a resolution condemning the military aggression of Russia and Belarus against Ukraine. A series of demonstrations in support of Ukraine were organized in Vilnius and other major cities. On the following day Lithuania’s Radio and Television Commission suspended the operation of six Russian-language television channels in the country over the broadcast of incitements to war and propagandist material. The Mayor of Vilnius, Šimašius, announced in March that the street in the capital where the Russian embassy was located was to be renamed `Ukrainian Heroes’ Street’. The nationwide state of emergency expired in September, after which emergency measures remained in force only in the regions bordering Belarus and Kaliningrad, and were subsequently extended.</p>
                         <p>The LSDP won municipal elections held on 5 March 2023 and 19 March, securing 358 seats nationwide and 17 mayoral posts. The TS-LKD obtained 239 seats and won only five mayoral contests, although the party’s candidate, Valdas Benkunskas, was elected as Mayor of Vilnius, replacing Šimašius. The LVŽS received 185 seats and eight mayoral posts, and various regional political committees 183 seats and 11 mayoralties. Voter turnout was 48.9% in the first round and 45.8% in the second round.</p>
                         <p>In early June 2023 the Parliament failed to approve a demand by the TS-LKD for early parliamentary elections, amid a scandal over allegations of the past misuse of expenses by former local government officials, including three cabinet members, which had already resulted in the resignation of the Minister of Education, Science and Sport, Jurgita Siugždinienė. Prime Minister Šimonytė had pledged to resign if the demand was rejected, although this threat was retracted after the party leadership failed to support it. In mid-June the Parliament approved legislation to replace the expenses systems in municipal government, which had prompted the scandal, with a new system of fixed salaries. Šiugždinienė was replaced by Gintautas Jakštas of the TS-LKD in July, but he subsequently announced his resignation in April 2024. Meanwhile, in late March Laurynas Kasčiūnas had been appointed as Minister of National Defence, following the resignation of Arvydas Anušauskas, amid reported tensions with Šimonytė. Šimonytė had confirmed in October 2023 that she would contest the presidential election, scheduled for 12 May 2024, as the candidate of the TS-LKD. Nausėda was also to stand as a candidate in the forthcoming election, which was to be held alongside a new referendum on dual citizenship. Legislative elections had been scheduled for 13 October.</p>

                    <p id="LT.IS.27">Agreement was reached with the Russian Federation in September 1992 on the withdrawal of the estimated 38,000 former Soviet troops remaining in Lithuania, and the final troops left, as scheduled, on 31 August 1993. In October 1997 President Brazauskas undertook the first official visit to Russia by a Baltic head of state since the disintegration of the USSR: a state border delimitation treaty was signed, and bilateral co-operation agreements were concluded on joint economic zones and the Baltic contin­ental shelf. The border treaty was ratified by the Parliament in October 1999 but was not ratified by Russia until May 2003. Under an agreement between the EU and Russia, simplified visa arrangements for Russian citizens traversing Lithu­ania to reach Kaliningrad were implemented in February 2003.</p>
                    <p>Relations between Lithuania and Russia were strained in June 2008, when the Parliament adopted legislation prohibiting the public display of Soviet and Nazi symbols. In February 2010, in the highest level bilateral meeting to take place since 2001, Grybauskaitė and Russian premier Vladimir Putin held talks on bilateral co-operation in Helsinki, Finland. Russia’s annexation of the Crimean peninsula in March 2014 (see Ukraine) was met with strong concern in Lithuania. In April Parliament adopted a resolution demanding the withdrawal of Russian forces (believed to be operating covertly) from Ukraine, while expressing support for the introduction of EU sanctions against Russia. Following an increase in intimidatory tactics by the Russian military, in September Russian officers detained a Lithu­anian shipping vessel in the Barents Sea on the grounds that it had been fishing illegally, subsequently impounding it in the Russian port of Murmansk. The vessel was released in February 2015, after a fine of €53,000 was imposed by a local court.</p>
                    <p>
          In January 2016 the `January 13’ trial began of 65 former Soviet military officials and army officers (later expanded to 67), who had been charged with responsibility for the killing of 14 people in Vilnius by Soviet troops in 1991 (see 
          <i>Domestic Political Affairs</i>
          ). The Russian authorities had refused to co-operate with the proceedings, and only two former military officers were present. In November 2017 the Parliament adopted legislation based on the US Magnitsky Act, imposing sanctions against foreign citizens accused of corruption and human rights violations. The construction of a 45-km fence along the border with Kaliningrad, which was intended to curb trafficking and strengthen border security, was completed in December. 
          <!--https://uawire.org/lithuania-bans-entry-to-44-russian-citizens-->
          In January 2018 the Lithuanian Minister of the Interior banned 49 Russian citizens accused of money laundering and human rights offences from entering the country, following the adoption of the Magnitsky Act. In March the Lithuanian Government expelled three Russian diplomats and banned 44 other Russians from entering the country as part of sanctions imposed by numerous EU and other states in response to an alleged Russian nerve agent attack in the United Kingdom. The Russian Government duly announced in April that several Lithuanian political figures had been barred from entering Russia. Upon the conclusion of the `January 13’ trial in March 2019, a former Soviet senior intelligence officer, Mikhail Golovatov, and a former defence minister, Dmitrii Yazov, were sentenced 
          <i>in absentia</i>
           to prison terms of 12 and 10 years, respectively, on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity, prompting the Russian Government to accuse Lithuania of `unfriendly and provocative’ actions. In an exchange of prisoners effected in November, however, Russia released two Lithuanians who had been sentenced to prison terms for espionage in 2016, together with one Norwegian citizen, while two Russian citizens who had been convicted by the Lithuanian authorities in 2017 of operating on behalf of Russian intelligence were pardoned and released. After the Czech Republic in April 2021 expelled 18 Russian diplomats over suspicions of Russian military intelligence involvement in an explosion in the country in 2014, the Lithuanian Government declared two members of the Russian embassy 
          <i>personae non gratae</i>
          , in a demonstration of solidarity. Russia subsequently expelled two Lithuanian diplomats.
        </p>
                    <p>
          Following Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, in April the Lithuanian Government became the first in the EU to suspend all gas imports from Russia and strongly supported the EU’s economic sanctions regime; shortly afterwards Lithuania expelled the Russian ambassador (following reports of war crimes against civilians in Ukraine), while recalling its ambassador to Moscow. In May Parliament adopted unanimously a resolution declaring Russia `a terrorist state’ and denouncing the Russian invasion of Ukraine as `genocide against the Ukrainian people’. In June Lithuania banned the transit of sanctioned goods from mainland Russia to Kaliningrad by road and rail. Following protests and threats of retaliation from the Russian Government, the European Commission issued guidelines in July specifying that the transportation of goods to Kaliningrad by rail was permitted; Lithuania consequently lifted the ban on rail transit (although the restrictions on road transit were retained). The Lithuanian Government increased the alert level of its army in September, after Russian President Putin declared a partial military mobilization for the war in Ukraine. In October the Russian acting chargé d’affaires, Sergei Ryabokon, was declared 
          <i>persona non grata</i>
          , reportedly in response to public statements he had made regarding the events in Lithuania on 13 January 1991. President Nausėda urged the imposition of more stringent sanctions against Russia and in February 2023, together with the premiers of Estonia, Latvia and Poland, proposed that €300,000m. in Russian assets that had been frozen under EU sanctions be used for reconstruction work in Ukraine. In March Russia imposed sanctions on 144 citizens of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, in reprisal for their support for EU sanctions. In March 2024 the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs published a list of 347 Baltic politicians who were prohibited from entering Russian territory. Lithuania has pledged significant military aid to Ukraine since the Russian invasion, and in July 2023 the State Defence Council confirmed that Lithuania would provide military assistance worth some €200m. during 2024-26. As part of a trilateral transit agreement between Lithuania, Poland and Ukraine, in October 2023 it was agreed to move customs checks on Ukrainian grain from the Polish border to the Lithuanian port of Klaipėda, in order to expedite exports of Ukrainian grain.
        </p>
                    <p>In November 2017 EU officials expressed support for Lithuanian concerns about safety regulations at the construction site of Belarus’s Russian-financed nuclear power plant in Astravets, near the Lithuanian border. Despite continued campaigning against the plant in Lithuania, its first reactor entered into operation in November 2020. Meanwhile, following a disputed presidential election in Belarus and the ensuing state repression of protests in the country, in mid-August Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tsikhanouskaya announced that she had fled to Vilnius. In late August Lithuania’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs proposed the imposition of sanctions on 118 Belarusian officials, including President Alyaksandr Lukashenka. In response, Lukashenka stated that he had presented a proposal to his Government that Belarusian trade flows be diverted from Lithuanian ports. At the end of August Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia imposed travel bans on Lukashenka and 29 other Belarusian officials (prior to EU agreement on collective sanctions). The three countries expanded the travel bans to an additional 98 Belarusian officials in September. In December Belarusian oil exports via the port of Klaipėda were suspended.</p>
                    <p>On 2 July 2021 the Lithuanian Government declared an `extraordinary situation’ in response to an influx of illegal migrants from Belarus. President Nausėda on 21 July signed a law that had been rapidly adopted by the Parliament, amending the legal status of migrants and facilitating their deportation. Lithuania, Latvia and Poland accused Belarus of `hybrid warfare’ activities as evidence emerged that Belarusian border officials were assisting and encouraging migrants (principally from Iraq) to cross illicitly into the EU, in apparent reprisal for support of the Belarusian opposition and of the sanctions against Lukashenka’s regime. Parliament approved the construction of a barrier along the border with Belarus in August. After large numbers of migrants attempted forcibly to enter Poland from Belarus, in November the Parliament declared a state of emergency in the border region with Belarus (which remained in force until January 2022). Completion of the 550-km border fence with Belarus, at a cost of around €150m., was announced in August. In January 2023 Lithuania revoked an agreement on the principles of co-operation that had been signed with Belarus in June 2006. With effect from February 2023 the Government also terminated a 2019 agreement on co-operation with the customs and border services of Belarus and closed a main border checkpoint in order to install increased security measures. In August 2023 Lithuania closed two of its six border crossings with the country, owing to security concerns. Evidence had earlier emerged that thousands of soldiers linked to the private Russian paramilitary Wagner Group were present in Belarus. In November the second reactor at the Astraverts nuclear plant commenced operations. Lithuania continued to express concerns over the risks posed by equipment failures, delays in responding to safety risks and a lack of transparency during the commissioning of the reactor, and urged operations to be suspended. Two further border crossings with Belarus were closed with effect from March 2024.</p>
                    <p>In April 2023 the Parliament approved the introduction of sanctions applicable to all Russian and Belarusian citizens from 1 May, restricting access to entrance visas, and preventing them from securing residency or importing or exporting Ukrainian currency. In addition, Russian citizens were to be prohibited from purchasing property on Lithuanian territory.</p>
                    <p id="LT.IS.29">In January 1992 Lithuania and Poland signed the Declaration on Friendly Relations and Neighbourly Co-operation’, which guaranteed the rights of the respective minority ethnic groups and recognized the existing border between the two countries. The respective heads of state signed a full treaty of friendship and co-operation in April 1994. Relations with Poland deteriorated after 2010, owing mainly to concerns about the welfare of the Polish minority in Lithuania. However, amid conflict in eastern Ukraine, in September 2014 the ministers responsible for defence of Poland, Lithuania and Ukraine signed an agreement in Warsaw, the Polish capital, establishing a joint military force, the 4,500-member Lithuanian-Polish-Ukrainian Brigade, to participate in peacekeeping operations. Relations with Poland improved significantly thereafter.</p>

           and the 
          <xr pageref="Y" ref="WB0231XD.IO.TXT.9">Baltic Council</xr>
          . In December 2000 a protocol was signed for the re-demarcation of the land border between the two countries. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania established a common Nordic-Baltic energy market in mid-2013, under the European Commission’s 2009 Baltic Energy Market Interconnection Plan; the North-Western European power market coupling project, which was designed to create an integrated European electricity market, was formally launched in February 2014. In January 2017 the premiers of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, meeting in the Estonian capital, Tallinn, signed a trilateral agreement on the development of the `Rail Baltica’, with EU funding, which was to connect the Baltic states and Central European railway networks. Construction of the Rail Baltica main line began officially in November 2019 and was initially scheduled for completion by 2026 (although the plans were subject to delays). In January 2024 Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia agreed to establish a common Baltic defence zone at their borders with Russia and Belarus.

          Lithuania pursued close co-operation with, and eventual integration into, the political, economic and defence systems of Western Europe, notably the 
          <xr pageref="Y" ref="NATO.IO">North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)</xr>
           and the EU. Formal negotiations on EU membership began in February 2000. As a concession to achieve EU membership, the Government approved a draft national energy strategy in September 1999, which provided for the decommissioning of the first unit of the Ignalina nuclear power plant by 2005. In June 2002 Lithuania agreed to decommission the plant’s remaining unit, which eventually closed in December 2010. In December 2002 Lithuania and nine other countries were invited formally to join the EU on 1 May 2004; at a national referendum held in May 2003 90.0% of participants voted in favour of membership, and Lithuania acceded to the EU as scheduled. Following a recommendation by the European Commission issued in June 2014, Lithuania was admitted to the eurozone on 1 January 2015.

                    <p>In November 2002 Lithuania was one of seven countries invited to join NATO; Lithu­ania became a full member of the Alliance on 29 March 2004. In January 2015 the Lithuanian Ministry of Defence confirmed that NATO was to establish international command centres in Lithuania and five other Eastern and Central European states as part of plans to establish an expanded rapid reaction force; the permanent command post, with 40 personnel, was established in Vilnius in September. At a NATO summit meeting in July 2016, members agreed to deploy four multinational battalions to the Baltic states and Poland. In January 2017 Lithuania signed a Defence Co-operation Agreement with the USA that formalized the presence of US forces in the country. US troops and equipment were subsequently deployed in Lithuania (and other Eastern European states) on a rotational basis under Operation Atlantic Resolve (which had been initiated by the US Administration in mid-2014 to demonstrate commitment to collective security among NATO member states). Deployment of the NATO multinational battalion, led by Germany, also began in January 2017.</p>
                    <p>
          Prior to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, but amid increasing concerns about the mass deployment of Russian troops at Ukraine’s borders, in a joint statement issued in January the defence ministers of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania announced the provision of US-manufactured weaponry to the Ukrainian Government. Ukraine received a consignment of anti-aircraft missile systems and ammunition from Lithuania on 13 February, and some 500 Lithuanian military training personnel were subsequently deployed there. Meanwhile, in mid-February around 350 German troops began to arrive in Lithuania to reinforce the NATO battlegroup. After Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Lithuania in March, when he assured the Government of NATO support for the Baltic states against Russian aggression
          <!--https://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english/19/1637162/us-to-send-400-additional-troops-to-lithuania-blinken-->
          and announced that 400 US troops would be dispatched to Lithuania, in addition to a rotational US battalion of around 500 troops then stationed at Pabradė, north of Vilnius.
        </p>
                    <p>
          At a NATO summit held in Vilnius on 11-12 July 2023, the `most comprehensive defence plans since the end of the Cold War’ were agreed, and NATO heads of state and government confirmed a package of support for Ukraine, including the establishment of a NATO-Ukraine Council and confirmation of its future membership of the Alliance.

          The NATO battlegroup in Lithuania numbered some 1,460 troops at December 2023; in addition to Germany, the contributing states at that time were Belgium, the Czech Republic, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway and the USA. In mid-December Germany and Lithuania signed an agreement for the permanent deployment of some 4,800 German soldiers in Lithuania.
        </p>
                    <p>In November 2021 the People’s Republic of China downgraded its relations with Lithuania and withdrew its ambassador from the country, after the Republic of China (Taiwan) opened a Representative Office under the name `Taiwan’, rather than `Taipei’, in Vilnius. An unofficial Chinese embargo on exports from Lithuanian firms in the pharmaceuticals, electronics and food sectors was reported subsequently. On 23 November the Export-Import Bank of the United States signed a memorandum of understanding with the Lithuanian Government on export credit worth some US&#160;$600m., which was intended to counter the Chinese reprisal measures. In January 2022 the EU launched a case against China at the World Trade Organization, alleging coercive trade practices. The Lithuanian authorities announced in February that China had suspended imports of beef, dairy products and beer from Lithuania, citing a lack of documentation. Lithuania nevertheless opened a new reciprocal Representative Office in Taiwan in September. In January 2023 the WTO agreed to a request from the EU for the establishment of a dispute panel to examine the Chinese measures affecting trade with Lithuania. In November Minister of Foreign Affairs Landsbergis announced that normalization talks were ongoing with China.</p>

               <p id="LT.IS.48">
        Lithuania became a member of the eurozone on 1 January 2015. In accordance with a government priority to reduce dependency on Russian energy supplies, construction of an offshore liquefied natural gas terminal at Klaipėda was completed in 2014. In addition, a 1,000-MW electricity link between the Baltic transmission system and the grid of continental Europe, the Lithuania-Poland interconnection, began operations in 2015, and a further gas pipeline interconnection between Lithuania and Poland opened in May 2022. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020 the Government announced wide-ranging economic measures totalling €2,500m. to mitigate the impact for businesses and workers. In November 2021 the People’s Republic of China introduced an unofficial embargo on principal Lithuanian exports, in reprisal for Lithuania’s closer ties with the Republic of China (Taiwan—see 
        <i>Foreign Affairs</i>
        ). The Taiwanese authorities subsequently created a US&#160;$200m. fund for investment in Lithuanian industries, and several economic co-operation projects were announced. Lithuania participated in wide-ranging Western sanctions implemented against Russia following its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, and in April Lithuania halted all Russian gas imports. Trade turnover with Russia decreased by about 30% in 2022 (although many Lithuanian companies continued to export unsanctioned goods to Russia). Owing to the global impact of the war in Ukraine, inflation reached nearly 20% in 2022 (around twice the average rate in the 
        <xr pageref="Y" ref="WB02047.IO.TXT">European Union</xr>
        ), driven largely by a rise in food prices of some 36%. Under the budget for 2023, the Government allocated €556.8m. of borrowed funds to energy price subsidies for households and businesses in the first half of that year. In 2022 GDP increased by 1.9%, but the economy contracted by an estimated 0.3% in 2023, according to estimates by the European Commission, amid the ongoing impact of the war in Ukraine, although the rate of inflation also declined significantly during that year. In June Lithuania banned the transit via its territory of dual-use items that could be used to support hostilities in Ukraine, and additional dual-use items were prohibited from transit in November. At that time, according to the Ministry of Finance, humanitarian, financial and military assistance to Ukraine was equivalent to 1.4% of Lithuania’s GDP; defence spending had also increased considerably since 2021, and in March 2024 the Parliament supported measures to increase defence expenditure from the 2.5% of GDP spent in 2023 to at least 3.0% of GDP by 2025. The European Commission forecast that GDP growth would begin to recover at a rate of 2.1% in 2024, while the rate of inflation would continue to decline, to a rate of 2.4%, year on year. The budget for 2024 envisaged an increase in the fiscal deficit to 3% of GDP, thus reaching the deficit threshold stipulated by the EU (suspended between 2020 and 2023).
