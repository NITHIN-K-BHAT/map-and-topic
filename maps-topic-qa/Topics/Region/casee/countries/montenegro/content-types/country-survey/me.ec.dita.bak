          <heading>Introduction</heading>
          <p>Following the turbulence and conflict of the 1990s, with the accompanying negative political and economic consequences, Montenegro began an economic recovery at the beginning of the 2000s. The transition process in Montenegro was based on a high level of liberalization, resulting in considerable inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI), although it remains incomplete. The country’s growth model is predicated on consistent FDI inflows, and services, with the primary and secondary sectors accounting for a significantly lower proportion of gross domestic product (GDP) than the tertiary sector.</p>
          <p>As an economy where growth is driven by household consumption and strong performance in the tourism sector, Montenegro belongs to a group of countries that are particularly vulnerable to macroeconomic shocks. Thus, the global economic crisis at the end of the first decade of the 2000s, as well as the subsequent crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic that emerged in the region in 2020, had a severe impact on the economic system in Montenegro, and pointed to various shortcomings. Both crises demonstrated the need to build a new model of economic growth based on a diversification of the national production base rather than a reliance on cheap foreign funds. Because Montenegro’s transition to a market economy remains incomplete, the state continues to play a significant role in the economy, as indicated by the enormous number of state-owned firms and the bloated public sector. As a result, and notwithstanding minor changes in the structure of government spending, the vast majority of government funds go towards wages and pensions for the public sector, with relatively little targeted towards public investment. As a consequence, fiscal consolidation would result in the release of cash that could be used for capital projects. Meanwhile, balancing the budget would enhance investor confidence, stimulating FDI, and resulting in higher rates of economic growth.</p>

          <heading>Economic Structure</heading>
          <p>Over the course of the last seven decades, the Montenegrin economy has experienced significant structural changes, initially motivated by the development of the socialist system of self-management. The period from the 1950s until the beginning of the 1990s was characterized by intense economic activity, which led to an increase in the contribution of industry to GDP, from around 7% in 1950 to some 38% in 1990, accompanied by the opposite trend in agriculture, the contribution of which decreased from some 39% of GDP in 1950 to 12% of GDP in 1990. The industrialization process was followed by strong development in the tertiary sector, which continues to account for the largest share of GDP. The transition from a socialist to a capitalist economy from the early 1990s resulted in a reduction in economic activity in all sectors, with industry and tourism being the most severely impacted, together with the adverse impact of the Balkan conflict.</p>
          <p>After regaining independence in 2006, Montenegro began to accelerate its economic development. This accelerated growth rate, at an average rate of some 8.7% per year in the pre-crisis period, exceeded the average for the member countries of the European Union (EU), which grew at an average annual rate of around 2.2% over this period. The main driver of growth was consumption, based on large inflows of foreign capital, as a result of which Montenegro became a leading country in the Western Balkan region in terms of attracting FDI. Considerable FDI inflows in 2006 and 2007 were directed towards the real (as opposed to the financial) sector, and the balance steadily moved towards the real sector in 2008. The principal macroeconomic indicators demonstrated the expansion of the Montenegrin economy in 2007, when there was strong real GDP growth, an increase in average earnings, a record inflow of FDI, a state budget surplus and a relatively low level of public debt (equivalent to some 27.5% of GDP). Nevertheless, other indicators were not as favourable. The high FDI inflow was matched by a less favourable record in foreign trade, with the deficit on the balance of payments reaching 32% of GDP.</p>
          <p>However, the onset of the global financial crisis, followed by the European debt crisis, led to the withdrawal of liquidity from Montenegro, and consequently a sharp recession and a huge increase in rates of unemployment. The effects of the crisis were felt by 2009, and were reflected in lower real estate turnover, decreased general economic activity and a decline in the number of tourist arrivals. The main factor that led to the growth of the tax base and thus increased tax revenues in the pre-crisis period was the expansion of lending activities in the banking sector. With the crisis, capital inflows were interrupted, and government revenues decreased. The principal source of government revenue has been value-added tax (VAT), rather than personal or corporate income taxes. This type of tax has a pro-cyclical character, which explains the significant decline in revenue that occurred with the slowdown in economic activity. At the same time, Montenegro failed to reduce government spending, which represents a significant share of GDP, so fiscal deficits deepened. The negative consequences of the crisis are best illustrated by the impact on real GDP, which recorded a contraction of 5.8% in 2009.</p>
          <p>Slow economic growth and a high level of economic uncertainty dominated Montenegro’s post-crisis period. Insolvency in the real sector increased along with public debt and the fiscal deficit, followed by reduction in FDI inflows. Tourism remained the main driver of economic growth, while a downward trend was recorded in industrial production, with a decline in the scope of activities in both construction and forestry. The crisis was officially declared over by the end of 2011. However, an economic contraction of 2.7%, was recorded in 2012. From 2013 activity in the transportation, construction and tourism sectors increased, which led to an average rate of economic growth of 4% during 2013-20.</p>
          <p>Positive trends were interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the overall effect of which was another contraction in GDP, which declined by 15.3% in 2020. As with the global economic crisis, the crisis caused by COVID-19 revealed fundamental flaws in the Montenegrin economy. A small and open economy like that of Montenegro, which is heavily reliant on imports, is extremely sensitive to external shocks. As outlined above, the growth model is based on both consistent FDI inflows and services, focused on the tertiary sector. Owing to its economic structure, the Montenegrin economy displayed little resilience to the pandemic shocks, resulting in a significant contraction in the services sector, as a result of lockdown measures and a decline in demand. Thus, tourism, as a primary driver of growth, accounting for roughly one-fifth of the Montenegrin economy, was one of the industries hit hardest by the impact of the pandemic.</p>
          <p>After a contraction in 2020, GDP growth in Montenegro reached 12.4% in 2021. Net exports served as the primary engine of growth, driven in large part by a strong rebound in tourism that increased private consumption and had positive effects on other sectors of the economy. However, compared with 2019, revenue from tourism remained significantly lower, at 70% of the pre-pandemic level. Meanwhile, the construction and agriculture sectors experienced declines in 2021, in contrast to the strong recovery in the service sector. </p>

          <heading>Monetary and Fiscal Policy</heading>
          <p>The situation in Montenegro is rather unusual, given the country’s full dollarization (euroization). Dollarization is a rigorous type of foreign exchange system—a fixed foreign exchange regime—in which a country utilizes another country’s currency in addition to, or instead of, its native currency. Montenegro used the dinar as its currency from the Second World War until 1999, while it formed part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In late 1999 a new, dual currency system using the German Deutsche Mark (DM) and the dinar was established, with the DM becoming the sole legal tender in 2001. The DM was supplanted by the common European currency, the euro, when it became the official method of payment in Germany and 11 other EU countries from 2002. Notably, as a non-EU member, Montenegro’s euroization was implemented unilaterally, without any official agreement with the European Central Bank (ECB). However, its use of the euro was given a form of recognition by the European Commission during negotiations towards the Stabilization and Association Agreement signed in 2007.</p>
          <p>The Central Bank of Montenegro (Centralna Banka Crne Gore—CBCG), the highest monetary authority in Montenegro, was established in 2001. The primary objective of monetary policy, as established by the Constitution, is to maintain financial stability. When it comes to price stability, the legislation anticipates that the CBCG will help to achieve this objective.</p>
          <p>However, euroization restricts access to monetary instruments. Under this system, it is no longer feasible to issue money, there is no reference interest rate, and an exchange rate policy is inconceivable. Available monetary policy instruments include reserve requirements, open market operations and credit operations. Still, owing to the low efficiency of the available instruments, the only instrument of monetary policy that the CBCG uses in practice is managing the reserve requirement ratio.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, Montenegro’s adoption of euroization had several benefits. In the context of the very open economy, the system of euroization has functioned as a self-balancing mechanism, with the inflation rate aligned with the average rate of inflation in the eurozone. Additionally, increased public trust in the monetary system led, on the one hand, to an increase in bank deposits, while on the other the credit activity of banks also intensified, especially in the period preceding the global economic crisis in 2008. During the crisis, bank activity registered a downward trend until 2013, when it began to rise again, until it was stymied by the crisis introduced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Owing to the higher credit risk, interest rates have been maintained at a high level. These high interest rates have contributed to the poor performance of the financial system and the economy, particularly in terms of economic activity and unemployment. When interest rates were rising, the CBCG did not take action to regulate interest rates, owing to the lack of monetary policy instruments, which, as identified above, is one of the principal disadvantages of euroization.</p>
          <p>In the Montenegrin economic system, fiscal policy has been the primary tool for conducting macroeconomic policy, owing to that lack of monetary policy instruments. Thus, fiscal policy has been the primary instrument for smoothing out business cycles and responding to crises. Nevertheless, economic policymakers must decide whether they aim to consolidate Montenegro’s fiscal position in the future, or stimulate economic growth, which is a precondition for fiscal stability. Although in the long term, these objectives are complementary, problems can arise in the short term, which has been the experience in Montenegro.</p>
          <p>In the period preceding the global economic crisis, Montenegro created a favourable tax environment in order to attract investors. Thus, taxes on both profits and incomes were reduced to 9% in the late 2000s, and taxes on dividends were restrained, while the Government also introduced various tax incentives for investing in equipment. Nevertheless, public spending increased owing to large public-sector wage bills and social costs.</p>
          <p>In response to the decline in GDP during the global economic crisis, the Government implemented fiscal stimulus measures, utilizing its fiscal reserves to handle the crisis, and resulting in a deterioration in fiscal balances. These changes in fiscal balances influenced the movement of public debt, so that the global crisis effectively reversed the previous declining trend in the ratio of public debt to GDP. Since then, public debt has continued to rise, reaching some 105% GDP in 2020, as a consequence of the crisis introduced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the financial crisis in the 2000s, the Government spent years implementing various fiscal consolidation measures, including the introduction of fiscal rules. Although those measures were effective, these positive trends were interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in serious imbalances.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, there has been a concurrent trend towards population ageing, as a consequence of which the proportion of those aged over 65 years in the overall population is now exceptionally high, placing additional pressure on public finances. According to some estimates, the rate of population growth is expected to slow in the future, posing a further challenge to the welfare state in conjunction with the continued ageing of the population. An ageing population inevitably adds pressure on social spending, already dominated by pension costs, thus deepening the deficit and increasing public debt. However, decreased rates of population growth indicate a concomitant decline in labour force participation, reducing the potential for social security financing.</p>
          <p>After a sharp increase in the fiscal deficit in 2020, it decreased from 11% of GDP in 2020 to 2% of GDP in 2021. A rise in revenues, failure to complete capital projects and a decrease in current spending all contributed to the fiscal consolidation. Public debt amounted to around 85% of GDP in 2021, which was a decline compared with the previous year. A €750m. Eurobond issue in 2020 largely met the 2021 gross financing requirements. Due to euroization, inflation is primarily driven by global factors. Thus, rising food, beverage and transport prices were the main contributors to domestic inflation. </p>
          <p>In 2021 the Montenegrin Government adopted a reform programme known as Europe Now, aiming to raise the living standards in the country and to reduce the level of grey economy. The programme is based on the abolition of health care contributions and the introduction of a non-taxable portion of earnings of €700. In addition, the proportional 9% rate of corporate income tax has been abolished and a system of progressive rates has been introduced. In the medium term, the programme has the potential to reduce inequalities and stimulate formal employment and growth, but there are also many associated risks, especially fiscal ones.</p>

          <heading>Trade and FDI</heading>
          <p>As a small, open economy, Montenegro is highly dependent on imports. When analyzing the macroeconomic environment, international trade data are a cause for concern. According to the Statistical Office of Montenegro, total external trade in 2021 totalled €2,942.2m., of which exports of goods accounted for €437.1m., and imports accounted for €2,505.1m.; the value of exports was equivalent to only 17.4% of the value of imports. The principal individual trading partners, in terms of exports, were Serbia (accounting for €107.3m.), Switzerland (€50.7m.) and Bosnia and Herzegovina (€33.4m.). The principal individual trading partners in terms of imports were Serbia (€500.8m.), the People’s Republic of China (€245.2m.) and Germany (€231.2m.). In 2020 the trade deficit was equivalent to 35.0% of GDP.</p>
          <p>The Montenegrin economy records a persistent trade deficit, the size of which fluctuates with economic cycles and is linked to household consumption. High rates of economic growth were achieved between 2006 and 2008, owing to the massive expansion of lending by commercial banks. Both household consumption and private investment were strongly stimulated. The spectacular growth in consumption was accompanied by dramatic growth in the trade deficit. When the economic cycle reached its peak in 2008, the trade deficit represented 53.3% of GDP. The 2008/09 global economic crisis demonstrated the unsustainability of high economic growth that resulted from borrowing rather than accumulation. Overall liquidity suffered as a result of investor withdrawals prompted by a combination of uncertainty, tighter bank restrictions and reduced lending activity.</p>
          <p>The Montenegrin economy’s reliance on imports reveals serious structural issues. During the transition, deindustrialization took place, and the results of privatization were disappointing. Simultaneously, the services sector expanded, particularly in the areas of tourism and hospitality. There was no strategic approach in the integration of complementary industries. Agriculture and food processing, which should contribute significantly to what is offered by the tourism sector, remain underdeveloped. Except in rural areas, where ecotourism is growing, domestic products are not predominant within the tourism industry.</p>
          <p>Montenegro imports a broad range of products that it is, however, able to produce domestically, and its natural resources are under-utilized. Given the country’s enormous water resources, it appears paradoxical that the value of imports of bottled water exceeded €50m. over the previous six years. Food production also has great untapped potential. However, there is a mismatch between the location of natural resources (concentrated in the north) and human resources, which tend to migrate towards the central and southern regions. Both the essential affirmation of agricultural activity and the operationalization of an effective agricultural policy are lacking.</p>
          <p>Moreover, an unmethodical approach to policymaking has been a strategic error. This became particularly evident during the COVID-19 crisis, and with the stagnation of global supply chains in the first half of 2022. In 2003 Montenegro liquidated its commodities reserve system, which has resulted in increased uncertainty during the current global crisis, and delays in imports of basic food products (such as wheat and flour, table salt, edible oils, corn and sugar) have led to further growth in prices. A system of commodity reserves, as a stabilization mechanism, could have development potential with maximum involvement by the private sector in the fields of agriculture, food processing, industry and trade. The Montenegrin economy is unable to defend itself against global shocks, lacking the capacity to amortize interruptions in supply chains and protect domestic consumers from external rising prices.</p>
          <p>Economic growth in Montenegro is heavily influenced by FDI. The economy was liberalized in the 2000s and the euroization system was implemented, making it attractive to foreign investors. However, as a result, economic growth has become highly vulnerable to the impact of times of crisis. The stagnation of FDI has limited the capabilities of economic policymakers. During 2007-20 the value of FDI as a percentage of GDP averaged 15.2%, recording a minimum value of 5.2% of GDP in 2016 and a maximum of 37.3% of GDP in 2009 (with the recapitalization of the national energy company). At 2020 FDI was equivalent to 11.1% of GDP. Montenegro generated €6,500m. in FDI between 2010 and 2019, with net inflows of FDI reaching €4,200m. over the same period. There were FDI inflows from more than 120 countries worldwide, with €3,900m. (or 60.6%) coming from 10 principal nations. The five leading investors in Montenegro (by country) were the Russian Federation, Switzerland, Austria, Serbia and Italy. Amid numerous reforms to the legal framework, Montenegro has created a favourable tax policy for foreign investors: tax on profits was fixed at 9% until 2022 (when a progressive rate, based on profits, was introduced), income tax remains low, while the rate of VAT is 21% (or 7% at the reduced rate in place for certain products).</p>
          <p>However, the structure of FDI was adverse, particularly during the 2000s. Foreign investors were interested in buying state-owned enterprises that were about to be privatized, and as a consequence there was insufficient greenfield investment. Significant FDI inflows also caused changes to the structure of the economy. The reliance on FDI has increased in the services sector (notably tourism and banking), and in the real estate and telecommunications markets. The tourism sector, which accounts for nearly one-third of overall FDI inflows, currently records the highest level of FDI. Major tourism-related capital projects, including the development of the resorts of Porto Montenegro, Portonovi and Luštica Bay, have attracted substantial foreign investment. Existing investments in tourism total around €3,000m.</p>

          <heading>Labour Market and Social Policy</heading>
          <p>Labour market research has revealed structural flaws and threats to the economy’s dynamic growth. These primarily include high rates of long-term unemployment, high levels of official youth unemployment, a steady increase in the number of unemployed university graduates, and a significant structural mismatch between supply and demand in the labour market, both in terms of quantity and quality. Recent research indicates that only about one-half of Montenegrin employees work in their own area of specialism. This implies a significant discrepancy between the educational structure of employees and the needs of the employer. There is a mismatch both in terms of the quality of the professional qualifications achieved by those completing full-time education, and current technological requirements and working conditions in manufacturing and services.</p>
          <p>The most significant problem in the labour market is structural unemployment. Owing to the obvious imbalance between labour supply and demand, the most valuable resource—human capital—is often under-utilized. In 2021 demand for labour was 3.7 times lower than labour supply. At the end of 2021 Montenegro recorded a high rate of unemployment, of 15.8%, while the rate of employment was low, at 37.3%; the activity rate was also low, at 44.4%, while there was high long-term unemployment (defined as lasting for more than one year) of 55.4%, and a high rate of youth unemployment of 40% among those aged 15-24 years.</p>
          <p>In 2021 some 20,580 permits for the employment of foreign workers were issued. In the quotas for the employment of foreign workers, four groups of occupation constitute the predominant share (79.7%): construction, accommodation and food services, other service activities and trade. In the same year, the National Employment Agency registered 42,415 domestic unemployed workers. Montenegro imports unemployment, in addition to inflation. The recruitment of cheap labour from the countries of South-Eastern Europe, primarily in the services sector, promotes the migration of workers throughout the wider area. Internal migration, meanwhile, has been very significant in Montenegro. Migration from the north to central and southern Montenegro is a particularly significant concern that has its source in uneven regional development. The unemployment rate in the southern (coastal) region was 5.2%, while in the north it was 36.4%.</p>
          <p>One of the most pressing issues confronting the Montenegrin labour market is informal employment, which presents a significant obstacle to the functioning and growth of a market-orientated economy. Although work in the informal sector remains a major source of revenue for many households, the negative implications, both for individuals and for society as a whole, exceed its benefits. Informal employment is predominantly within the private sector (in services, including trade and tourism, and construction). Seasonal workers are the primary source of informal employment in the central region and along the coast. Newer businesses are more likely to make use of informal employment to increase competitiveness, especially if they face barriers to market entry.</p>
          <p>In Montenegro 22.6% of the population was at risk of poverty in 2020, according to official statistics. The risk was most acute among the youngest members of the population (32.6% of those under the age of 18 were at risk of poverty), and was most prevalent in the north (44.5%). Poverty statistics deteriorated owing to the effects of the COVID-19 crisis, and rising unemployment, together with market instability, have prompted reforms in tax and social policy. From 1 January 2022 the minimum wage was increased from €250 to €450. The Government also abolished health insurance contributions on salaries and introduced a system for the progressive taxation of wages, introducing a 0% tax rate for gross salaries up to €700; salaries over €700 are taxed at 9%, while a rate of 15% has been imposed on gross salaries exceeding €1,000. As a result the average net wage in Montenegro increased from €530 to €700. Social policy measures introduced in 2022 included a universal child allowance for pre-school children (up to the age of six years) and the provision of free textbooks for all primary school students. In addition, the Government began preparing a project to implement the Youth Guarantee programme, modelled on that introduced by EU member states, to improve the employability of people under the age of 30.</p>
          <p>
      The annual inflation rate reached a high of 17.2% in December 2022, generated primarily by the global food and energy crisis resulting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February. The high price of oil contributed to growth in transport costs of 16.2%, and price inflation for food and non-alcoholic beverages rose sharply to 22.6%. The relative impact of rising food prices on the purchasing power of Montenegrin consumers is significantly greater than in developed economies, with the share of food and non-alcoholic beverages in the consumer basket amounting to almost 35%. Thus, increases in
      
       average wages in 2022 were predominantly nominal in nature, and were rapidly eroded by the high inflation rate. The real growth in workers’ earnings was significantly lower than the nominal one.
    </p>
          <p>Nevertheless, the increase in the minimum wage from €250 to €450 had a positive effect on the purchasing power and wellbeing of low-skilled workers. (Given the high degree of inequality, the average salary is not an optimal indicator of purchasing power.) The change in the taxation of the minimum wage also contributed to a reduction of the shadow economy, which implies an unusual growth in employment after the tax reform was introduced.</p>

          <heading>Future Prospects</heading>
          <p>Montenegro became independent in 2006 and is a candidate country for full membership of the EU. Membership negotiations commenced in 2012, which require significant structural changes to both society and the economy. Montenegro’s economic transition has, however, been protracted. Significant reforms are required, which demand social consensus and commitment from the principal decisionmakers.</p>
          <p>The reforms aim to result in a higher level of competence among policymakers, which is a precondition for them to be credible and effective. The development of monetary policy in the euroization regime has limited scope. It is essential to focus on increasing the independence of the CBCG. Fiscal policy is of primary importance. High public debt, combined with monetary policy limits, is a significant barrier to recovery. An effective stabilization mechanism must be created, with a functional commodity reserve system. The role of the state is to reduce economic uncertainty. Market participants must have confidence in government policies, and such policy must be created in adherence to fixed rules, since Montenegro’s institutions remain weak, and often lack the competence to make discretionary decisions. Strengthening institutions is a precondition for combating the grey economy, particularly given that widespread corruption continues to be a source of concern.</p>
          <p>Tight lending conditions hamper small companies, whereas the expansion of small businesses creates a new entrepreneurial class, which reduces social inequality. The Montenegrin economy is characterized by high income inequality. A small group of winners and an army of losers emerged from the transition. Reforms must ensure a balance in order to enable all to benefit from economic progress.</p>
          <p>Montenegro also needs to mobilize its own resources. Relying solely on tourism is a high-risk strategy, and the economic structure requires diversification. Further investment in the transport system, organic agriculture and investment in the energy sector are the backbones of sustainable growth. Financial market development, meanwhile, must support the real sector. The use of national resources should begin with human capital. Investing in knowledge is an investment that has multiplicative utility. Education policy has to take into account the needs of the economy, since the gap between supply and demand for labour is both costly and socially inefficient. `Brain drain’, through the emigration of highly qualified workers, is a process that Montenegro is currently facing and that needs to be reversed. Otherwise, investing in the education system will simply be a missed investment. Policymakers need to improve labour market flexibility and mobility. In this regard, promoting the principle of security and minimizing the rigidity of legal solutions in the labour market is required. It is important to focus on lifetime learning initiatives that will develop the flexibility and employability of workers. The Government also needs to increase public spending in areas that generate the most social and economic growth. Greater investment in education and health, along with labour market reforms, would improve the employment and financial situation of young people and help to create a more productive workforce.</p>
