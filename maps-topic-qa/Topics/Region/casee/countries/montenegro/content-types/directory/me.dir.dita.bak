Sovereignty is vested in Montenegrin citizens, who exercise it directly and through the freely elected representatives. The territory of Montenegro is unified and inalienable. Human rights and liberties are guaranteed and protected. Ratified international agreements and generally accepted rules of international law have supremacy over national legislation and are directly applicable when they regulate relations differently from internal legislation. The official language in Montenegro is Montenegrin. The Cyrillic and Latin alphabets are equal. The Serbian, Bosnian, Albanian and Croatian languages are also in official use. Religious communities, which are equal and free in the exercise of religious affairs, are separated from the state. Montenegro will co-operate and develop friendly relations with other states, and regional and international organizations, based on the principles and rules of international law. The Skupština Crne Gore (Assembly of Montenegro) shall decide on the manner of accession to the European Union. Montenegro shall not enter into a union with another state by which it loses its independence and full international personality.</p>
