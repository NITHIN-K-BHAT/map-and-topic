               <p>Montenegro is situated in the central Balkan peninsula, in South-Eastern Europe. It has frontiers with Bosnia and Herzegovina to the west and north-west, Serbia to the north, Kosovo to the east, and Albania to the south-east, and a short frontier with Croatia in the south-west. There is a western coastline along the Adriatic Sea (part of the Mediterranean). Montenegro has a rugged mountainous terrain, dominated by the Black Mountains (Crna Gora), from which the country takes its name. The climate is Mediterranean near the coast, and continental inland. Mountainous areas have a colder climate with heavy snowfall in winter. Average temperatures range from between −7°C (19.4°F) and 23°C (73.4°F) inland, and between 11°C (51.8°F) and 28°C (84.2°F) on the coast. Montenegro's mountainous regions receive some of the highest amounts of rainfall in Europe. The 2007 Constitution describes the principal language as Montenegrin, with the Cyrillic and Latin alphabets of equal status. Serbian, Bosnian and Croatian (all of which, in common with Montenegrin, were formerly described as variants of Serbo-Croat) and Albanian are also in official use. The principal religion is Orthodox Christianity, and there are significant Roman Catholic and Muslim communities. The national flag (proportions 1 by 2) is red, with a golden coat of arms depicting a double-headed eagle. Cetinje is described in the Constitution as the historical capital of Montenegro, while Podgorica is the capital.</p>

                    <heading>Historical Context</heading>
                    <p>After the Second World War, Montenegro became one of the six constituent republics of the federal Yugoslavia established by the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (later the League of Communists of Yugoslavia) under Josip Broz (Tito). Montenegro generally supported the Serbian reassertion of dominance within Yugoslavia after the death of Tito in the 1980s. Subsequent reforms reconstituted the Skupština Crne Gore (Assembly of Montenegro) as a unicameral 125-member body and replaced Montenegro’s collective presidency with a directly elected state President. At elections in December 1990, the ruling Savez Komunista Crne Gore (League of Communists of Montenegro), later renamed the Demokratska Partija Socijalista Crne Gore (DPS—Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro), secured 83 seats in the new legislature, and its candidate, Momir Bulatović, became President. In February 1991 Bulatović invited Milo Ðukanović, also of the DPS, to head the republican Government, while Svetozar Marović became the Speaker of the Assembly.</p>
                    <p>
          With armed conflict in Yugoslavia and the disintegration of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (see 
          <xr pageref="Y">Serbia</xr>
          ), Montenegro adopted a declaration of state sovereignty on 18 October 1991; however, its continued commitment to the federation with Serbia was confirmed in a referendum in March 1992. The two republics announced a new federal Constitution, creating the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY), which came into effect on 27 April. A new Montenegrin Constitution was introduced on 12 October and in early 1993 Bulatović was re-elected as Montenegrin President, while Ðukanović remained premier.
        </p>
                    <p>Relations with Serbia deteriorated from the mid-1990s, particularly in response to the attempts of Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević to disassemble Montenegro’s separate defence and foreign policy structures. Ðukanović in early 1997 resisted the demands of Bulatović that he dismiss all anti-Milošević ministers in the Montenegrin Government. The ruling DPS (which won further Montenegrin legislative elections in November 1996) subsequently split into two factions, as a result of Bulatović's support for Milošević (who became the Yugoslav President in July 1997). Bulatović and Ðukanović, who by then led separate factions within the DPS, became the leading candidates in the Montenegrin presidential election of October. Ðukanović won the second round of voting, with 50.8% of the votes.</p>
                    <p>Ðukanović was inaugurated as President of Montenegro in January 1998, amid violent protests from supporters of Bulatović. A compromise agreement on early legislative elections was reached, pending which a transitional Government, led by the pro-Ðukanović faction of the DPS, was formed in February. Bulatović’s faction refused to participate and renamed itself the Socijalistička Narodna Partija Crne Gore (SNP—Socialist People’s Party of Montenegro). In the elections, held in May, the DPS won an outright majority, and a coalition Government, led by Filip Vujanović, was formed in July. Bulatović, who was appointed as Yugoslav Prime Minister in May, proceeded to purge many Montenegrin officials from federal institutions. Montenegro refused to acknowledge the administration of Bulatović, and suspended all links with his Government in August.</p>
                    <p>
          Relations with Serbia continued to deteriorate during 1999. Continued military action by Serbian forces against the ethnic Albanian population in the Serbian province of Kosovo led to the aerial bombardment of Yugoslavia by forces of the 
          <xr pageref="Y" ref="NATO.IO">North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)</xr>
           in March-June, with Montenegro suffering damage. Montenegro refused to recognize the state of war declared by the Yugoslav Government in March, and Ðukanović subsequently refused to place Montenegrin security forces under federal military command, as ordered by President Milošević.
        </p>
                    <p>Following the conflict in Kosovo, the Yugoslav federation became increasingly unstable. In November 1999 Montenegro replaced the depreciating Yugoslav dinar with the German Deutsche Mark as its official currency, after which Serbia imposed a full economic embargo against Montenegro. The federal army’s seizure of control over Montenegro’s main airport in December further escalated tensions.</p>
                    <p>
          After elections in September 2000, Milošević was ousted as Yugoslav President in October, and Bulatović subsequently resigned as premier. Ðukanović began to advocate full independence for Montenegro, urging a referendum on the issue. At legislative elections on 22 April 2001 the DPS-led coalition won 36 of the 77 seats, the SNP-led alliance 33 and the pro-independence Liberalni Savez Crne Gore (LSCG—Liberal Alliance of Montenegro) six. Vujanović was reappointed as premier. Meanwhile, negotiations over a new form of association with Serbia continued, with mediation by the 
          <xr pageref="Y" ref="WB02047.IO.TXT">European Union (EU)</xr>
          , from November. The federal Yugoslav leadership and that of both republics signed a framework agreement on confederation on 14 March 2002, providing for a shared presidency and legislature, and for separate republican economic and other state structures. Montenegro had the right to schedule a referendum on independence after three years. Later in March the LSCG resigned from the Government in protest against the agreement. The Assembly approved the accord on 9 April; however, unable to form a new coalition administration, Vujanović dissolved the legislature in July and scheduled further elections.
        </p>
                    <p>On 20 October 2002 the DPS-led, pro-independence ruling coalition, the Demokratska Lista za Evropsku Crnu Goru (Democratic List for a European Montenegro), won 39 of the 75 seats in the republican legislature. Zajedno za Promjene (Together for Changes), led by the SNP, which opposed a looser union with Serbia, received 30 seats. Vujanović was elected Speaker of the Assembly on 5 November, and became acting President of Montenegro 20 days later, when Ðukanović resigned from that post. Following a dispute over the allocation of ministerial portfolios with the DPS’s ally, the Socijaldemokratska Partija Crne Gore (SDP—Social Democratic Party of Montenegro), the Assembly approved a new coalition Government, headed by Ðukanović, on 8 January 2003. Meanwhile, both the SNP and the LSCG boycotted the presidential election, held on 22 December 2002, which was consequently won by Vujanović, with 83.7% of the votes cast, but less than the one-half of the total electorate legally required to validate the result. A repeated poll on 9 February 2003 was also declared invalid, as only 47% of the electorate voted, prompting the Assembly to abolish the regulation on minimum participation. Vujanović was duly elected President on 11 May, with 62.9% of the votes cast (and with the participation of some 48% of the electorate).</p>

                    <heading>Domestic Political Affairs</heading>
                    <p>Meanwhile, on 29 January 2003 the Montenegrin Assembly approved the new arrangements for confederation with Serbia. On 4 February the Federal Assembly formally adopted a Constitutional Charter, transforming Yugoslavia into the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro. A new Assembly, President (former Montenegrin parliamentary Speaker and DPS leader Marović) and Prime Minister of the State Union were elected in late February and March. In July the Assembly adopted a new Montenegrin flag and anthem.</p>
                    <p>After it was agreed that the EU should set the conditions for and supervise the conduct of any referendum on Montenegrin independence, in February 2006 the EU announced that a proposal of Montenegrin independence would require the approval of 55% of those voting (with a minimum rate of participation of 50% of the electorate), in order to secure international recognition. Legislation providing for a referendum to be held on 21 May was duly enacted on 1 March.</p>

                         <heading>After Independence</heading>
                         <p>
            Two days after the referendum of 21 May 2006, the electoral authorities declared Montenegro to have voted in favour of independence. With a participation rate of over 86%, some 55.5% of votes were cast in favour of independence, thereby narrowly fulfilling the EU criteria. The Assembly duly declared Montenegro independent on 3 June. Serbia, which declared itself the successor state to the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro on 5 June, officially recognized Montenegro’s independence in mid-June and established diplomatic relations later that month. Montenegro was admitted to the 
            <xr pageref="Y" ref="OSCE.IO">Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)</xr>
             on 22 June and to the United Nations (UN) on 28 June. A new Ministry of Defence formally assumed responsibility for all military units of the State Union on Montenegrin territory, while in July agreement was reached on the division of the financial rights and obligations of the former State Union.
          </p>
                         <p>The ruling coalition of the DPS and the SDP won legislative elections held on 10 September 2006, securing 41 of the 81 seats in an expanded Assembly. The SNP-led alliance only obtained 11 seats, being displaced as the largest opposition grouping by the Serbian List, led by Andrija Mandić of the Srpska Narodna Stranka Crne Gore (SNS—Serb People's Party of Montenegro), which took 12 seats. A new, pro-European party, the Pokret za Promjene (PzP—Movement for Changes), also obtained 11 seats. The Liberalna Partija Crne Gore (Liberal Party of Montenegro—the successor organization to the LSCG), in alliance with the Bošnjačka Stranka (BS—Bosniak Party), secured three seats. In October Ðukanović announced that he would not seek to continue his premiership. The appointment of a new Government, headed by the hitherto Minister of Justice, Željko Šturanović, was approved by the Assembly on 10 November.</p>
                         <p>A new Constitution was approved by 55 of the 76 deputies present in the Assembly on 19 October 2007, narrowly achieving the requisite two-thirds’ majority, and was promulgated on 22 October. Although the new Constitution met EU standards, it was denounced by Serb parties in Montenegro, which particularly objected to the description of the main official language as Montenegrin.</p>
                         <p>On 31 January 2008 Šturanović resigned as Prime Minister, on grounds of ill health. On 29 February the appointment of Ðukanović as premier and of his Government (which remained unchanged from the previous administration) was narrowly approved in the Assembly. (Although an Italian investigation into organized crime allegations was under way, Ðukanović’s immunity from prosecution was restored by his return to office.)</p>
                         <p>Vujanović was re-elected to the presidency on 6 April 2008, with 51.9% of the votes cast, further consolidating the strength of the DPS. Mandić was placed second, with 19.6% of the votes. The rate of voter participation was estimated at 69%. Vujanović was inaugurated for a second term on 21 May.</p>
                         <p>In January 2009 the governing coalition proposed that legislative elections, due to take place in 2010, be brought forward in order to provide the administration with a stronger mandate to fulfil Montenegro’s commitments in the EU integration process. On 26 January the Assembly voted in favour of its dissolution to allow early elections, which were scheduled for 29 March. Later in January Mandić merged his SNS with the People’s Socialist Party to form a new party, Nova Srpska Demokratija (NOVA—New Serbian Democracy). At the elections to the Assembly on 29 March, Ðukanović’s Koalicija za Evropsku Crnu Goru (Coalition for a European Montenegro) secured victory, with 51.9% of the votes cast and 48 seats, while the SNP won 16.8% of the votes and 16 seats, NOVA 9.2% of the votes and eight seats, and the PzP 6.0% and seats. A participation rate of 66.2% was recorded. Following endorsement of Ðukanović’s premiership, a new Government was approved in the Assembly in early June.</p>
                         <p>In October 2010 the mandate of the Governor of the Central Bank, Ljubiša Krgović, was ended, after he criticized the provision of state assistance for the loss-making Prva Banka, in which Ðukanović’s brother held a majority share. On 21 December Ðukanović tendered his resignation as premier (while remaining DPS Chairman); Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Igor Lukšić was nominated by the DPS as his successor. The Assembly endorsed the nomination of Lukšić as Prime Minister and the establishment of a new Government (comprising the same coalition parties as previously) on 29 December. In September 2011 the Assembly adopted a new electoral law and amendments to education legislation providing for equality between the Serbian and Montenegrin languages in schools, in accordance with EU criteria for the opening of accession negotiations.</p>
                         <p>At the elections to the Assembly held on 14 October 2012, the Koalicija za Evropsku Crnu Goru, again led by Ðukanović, secured 46.3% of the votes cast and 39 seats (representing a loss of support compared with the 2009 elections). An alliance formed by the PzP and NOVA, the Demokratski Front (DF—Democratic Front), obtained 23.2% of the votes and 20 seats, the SNP 11.2% and nine seats, and Pozitivna Crna Gora (PCG—Positive Montenegro) 8.4% and seven seats. A participation rate of 70.6% was recorded. In November Ðukanović negotiated an agreement with the minority parties in the Assembly that enabled him to command a parliamentary majority, and was designated Prime Minister by Vujanović. On 4 December the Assembly approved Ðukanović’s new coalition Government, which included Lukšić as one of four Deputy Prime Ministers.</p>

                         <p>In January 2013 Vujanović declared his intention to seek a further term in office, although the SDP opposed his candidacy on the grounds that he had already served two terms (including during the period prior to independence). Vujanović and the consensus opposition candidate, DF leader Miodrag Lekić, both claimed victory shortly after the presidential election was conducted on 7 April. According to the official results, Vujanović was narrowly re-elected, with 51.2% of the votes cast. Although the Election Commission rejected all complaints of irregularities submitted by Lekić, the DF continued to accuse the authorities of malpractice. Vujanović was inaugurated for a further term of office on 20 May. In February 2014 the DF alliance announced a parliamentary boycott, citing the Government’s failure to adopt electoral reforms.</p>
                         <p>In September 2015 the DF alliance began a campaign of demonstrations to demand the resignation of Ðukanović’s Government, accusing it of corruption and electoral malpractice. The protests, which were joined by civil organizations, became violent on 17 October, when police forcibly dispersed demonstrators, injuring several opposition politicians. On 19 December Ðukanović announced a motion of confidence in his Government, after an official invitation earlier that month to commence NATO accession negotiations prompted dissent from opposition parties.</p>
                         <p>On 22 January 2016 SDP leader and Speaker of the Assembly Ranko Krivokapić (previously a close ally of Ðukanović) announced that the SDP was to end its participation in the coalition with the DPS and would not support the confidence vote. Anti-Government rallies in Podgorica intensified prior to the motion of confidence on 27 January, which was narrowly won by Ðukanović’s Government, with the support of the PCG. The DF renewed protests, and subsequently established an encampment outside the parliamentary buildings. Government and opposition leaders in late April signed an agreement providing for the appointment of an interim coalition government to prepare for legislative elections later that year. On 19 May the Assembly approved a new DPS-led coalition Government under Ðukanović, and also adopted a motion to remove Krivokapić as Speaker.</p>

                         <p>At the elections to the Assembly, held on 16 October 2016, the DPS was placed first (but again failed to secure a majority), obtaining 41.4% of the votes cast and 36 seats; the DF received 20.3% and 18 seats, the opposition Koalicija Ključ (Key Coalition) 11.1% and nine seats, Demokratska Crna Gora (DCG—Democratic Montenegro, established by breakaway members of the SNP) 10.0% and eight seats, and the SDP 5.2% and four seats. However, opposition parties rejected the election results, accusing the authorities of malpractice, and announced a boycott of the new Assembly. In early November Vujanović designated hitherto deputy premier Duško Marković, an ally of Ðukanović, as the new Prime Minister. The DPS reached a coalition agreement with the Socijaldemokrate Crne Gore (SDCG—Social Democrats of Montenegro), the BS and two other parties, thereby obtaining a narrow parliamentary majority. Marković’s new DPS-led Government, which included only four members of the previous administration, was approved by the Assembly on 28 November. The President of the SDCG, Ivan Brajović, was elected as the new Speaker of the Assembly on 24 November.</p>
                         <p>Meanwhile, in early November 2016 the Special State Prosecutor for organized crime, Milivoje Katnić, announced that the authorities had thwarted a conspiracy to assassinate Ðukanović on the day of the elections with the aim of overthrowing the Government and preventing its accession to NATO; a group of some 20 people, principally Serbian nationalists, had been arrested, including Gen. (retd) Bratislav Dikić, the former head of an elite Serbian police force. Although the opposition claimed that the allegations were politically motivated, two DF leaders, Mandić and Milan Knežević, were accused of involvement, and their parliamentary immunity was lifted in February 2017. Katnić alleged that the conspiracy had been organized by two Russian military intelligence officers who were sought by the authorities. In December the DF announced that it would end its parliamentary boycott.</p>

                         <p>In January 2018 parliamentary Speaker Brajović scheduled a presidential election for April. With President Vujanović ineligible for re-election, in March Ðukanović declared his candidacy, which was supported by the DPS and other government coalition parties. Ðukanović won the presidential election on 15 April, with 53.9% of the votes cast; Mladen Bojanić, an independent supported by the DF, was second-placed, receiving 33.4% of the votes. The outcome was widely interpreted as a reflection of support for Montenegro’s pro-Western orientation. The rate of participation was 63.9%. Local elections were conducted in 11 municipalities, including Podgorica, on 27 May; the DPS, strengthening its position, was placed first in 10 municipalities, securing a majority in five. Irregularities and violent incidents were reported by local monitoring bodies.</p>
                         <p>In February 2019 the Montenegrin authorities issued an international warrant for the arrest of Duško Knežević, the owner of the financially troubled Atlas Banka, who had fled to the United Kingdom following charges of money laundering and malpractice. Counter-accusations of corruption issued by Knežević against Ðukanović and the DPS prompted a series of anti-Government protests in Podgorica, led by the `Odupri se!’ (`Resist!’) group of civic activists, supported by opposition parties, to demand the resignation of public officials, including the President and chief prosecutors.</p>
                         <p>
            On 9 May 2019 the Higher Court sentenced to jail 13 defendants accused of planning to commit `terrorist acts’ in October 2016; the two Russian military intelligence agents were sentenced 
            <i>in absentia</i>
             to 15 and 12 years’ imprisonment. Dikić received a sentence of eight years, and Mandić and Milan Knežević sentences of five years. Mandić and Knežević were granted bail, pending an appeal.

                         <p>In May 2019 the Government passed a draft law on freedom of religion and the legal status of religious communities, under which religious buildings and sites would be registered as state property unless religious communities provided evidence of ownership. The legislation was strongly opposed by the Srpska Pravoslavna Crkva (SPC—Serbian Orthodox Church), which accused the Government of planning to confiscate its assets. Opposition supporters and Serbian Orthodox priests staged protests in Podgorica and other towns, and on 27 December DF deputies attempted to prevent the parliamentary vote on the legislation, which was nevertheless adopted. A total of 22 people, including the 18 DF deputies, were arrested. The law entered into force on 8 January 2020, requiring the Property Directorate to compile a register of all religious buildings and sites nationwide within a period of 12 months. Large protests led by the SPC, and joined by opposition supporters, continued, degenerating into violent clashes with the police in Podgorica in late January. At a meeting on 14 February, SPC representatives, headed by Metropolitan of Montenegro and the Littoral Amfilohije (Radović), submitted to Prime Minister Marković a list of proposed changes. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, during March the Government introduced a number of containment measures, including a nationwide curfew. Large protests related to the religious freedom law resumed in June, but were halted soon afterwards by the restrictions on public gatherings.</p>
                         <p>Elections to the Assembly were conducted on 30 August 2020, with 76.6% of the electorate participating. The DPS obtained 35.1% of the votes and 30 seats, followed by an opposition coalition, Za Budućnost Crne Gore (For the Future of Montenegro), largely comprising the DF, the SNP and a new pro-Serbian alliance, with 32.6% and 27 seats; another coalition led by the DCG, Mir je Naša Nacija (Peace is Our Nation), received 12.5% of the votes and 10 seats, and the Ujedinjena Reformska Akcija (URA—United Reform Action) won 5.5% and four seats. Following the decline in support for the DPS, Za Budućnost Crne Gore, Mir je Naša Nacija and the URA, which together comprised around 20 parties, many pro-Serbian and pro-Russian, held a narrow majority of 41 seats; they agreed to form a technocratic government (thereby removing the DPS from power after a period of some 30 years). The leader of Za Budućnost Crne Gore, Zdravko Krivokapić, a leader of the anti-Government protests, was nominated as Prime Minister-designate by the Assembly on 23 September, while the leader of Mir je Naša Nacija, Aleksa Bečić, was elected Speaker. Krivokapić’s Government was approved by the 41 deputies of the ruling coalition on 4 December. The leader of the URA, Dritan Abazović, became Deputy Prime Minister, while the other ministers were non-party members.</p>
                         <p>On 18 December 2020 the Government proposed changes to the religious freedom law to remove the obligation for religious communities to provide evidence of ownership. The amendments were narrowly approved by 41 votes cast in the Assembly, with opposition deputies boycotting the vote; a large anti-Government protest was staged outside the parliamentary building shortly beforehand. Ðukanović vetoed the amended law, which was again adopted by the Assembly on 20 January 2021, obliging him to sign it into effect. On 5 February the Appeals Court annulled the first instance verdicts issued in May 2019 against the 13 defendants over the alleged 2016 coup attempt, and requested that their trial be repeated.

                         <p>In June 2021 the Assembly voted to dismiss the Minister of Justice and Human and Minority Rights, Vladimir Leposavić, who had questioned the legitimacy of rulings by the UN’s International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia that classified the 1995 massacre in Srebrenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina, as genocide. The Assembly also adopted a resolution prohibiting public denial of the Srebrenica genocide. The DF, which had not supported the dismissal, announced a parliamentary boycott, after Krivokapić refused to reorganize the technocratic Government to include party members. </p>
                         <p>Following worsening relations within the ruling coalition, on 19 January 2022 the URA-led parliamentary bloc and opposition parties proposed a motion of no confidence in the Government, which was adopted by the Assembly on 4 February, with the support of 43 members. The Assembly voted three days later to remove Bečić as Speaker. On 2 March URA leader Abazović was nominated as Prime Minister-designate by President Ðukanović. His minority Government was approved by 46 votes in the 81-seat legislature on 28 April, when Danijela Đurović of the SNP was elected as the new Speaker.</p>
                         <p>On 8 July 2022 the Government voted in favour of a controversial `fundamental agreement’ with the SPC, which was, however, opposed by parties including the DPS and the SDP. Under the regulatory framework contained in the agreement, the Government would be obliged to register all Orthodox churches and monasteries as belonging to the SPC and undertake the restitution of SPC property that had been nationalized or confiscated by the communist-era authorities. The agreement was signed by Abazović on 3 August. The DPS and the SDP, arguing that it had been signed without consensus, announced their intention to initiate a parliamentary no confidence motion against the Government and demand early elections. On 20 August the Assembly (with 50 deputies voting in favour and one against) adopted a motion of no confidence in Abazović’s Government (which remained in office on an interim basis). In September 41 deputies in the Assembly proposed DF leader Lekić as Prime Minister-designate; however, Ðukanović refused to confirm his nomination of Lekić and expressed support for early elections. The Assembly voted to dismiss Minister of Foreign Affairs Ranko Krivokapić and Minister of Defence Raško Konjević, both SDP representatives, from the interim Government on 21 October, accusing them of acting against state interests. Meanwhile, the Constitutional Court remained without a quorum from September, after the DPS refused to approve candidates proposed to replace four retired judges (requiring a two-thirds’ parliamentary majority).</p>

                              <!--https://thegeopost.com/en/analysis/a-victory-of-populism-for-the-new-montenegrin-reality/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=a-victory-of-populism-for-the-new-montenegrin-reality-->
            Local elections held in 14 municipalities on 23 October 2022 represented a defeat for Ðukanović’s DPS, which lost control of several major municipalities, including Podgorica (held by the DPS since 1998). The DF, the DCG and a new political movement established by former independent ministers Milojko Spajić and Jakov Milatović, Evropa Sad! (ES!—Europe Now!), made large gains.
          </p>
                         <p>On 1 November 2022 the Assembly adopted new legislation enabling a majority of deputies to propose a Prime Minister-designate, thereby assuming a constitutional power assigned to the President. Later that month Jovana Marović resigned as Deputy Prime Minister for Foreign Policy, European Integration and Regional Co-operation and Minister of European Affairs, complaining that the continued political impasse was preventing the adoption of reforms necessary for EU membership. Lekić was designated Prime Minister by 41 deputies in the Assembly on 29 December; however, subsequent negotiations on the formation of a government collapsed in January 2023. In late February the Assembly finally elected three judges to the Constitutional Court, thereby ending the Court’s prolonged absence of quorum.</p>

                         <heading>Recent Developments: Pre-term Legislative Elections</heading>
                         <p>After the 90-day period allowed for the formation of a new government expired, President Ðukanović on 16 March 2023 issued a decree dissolving the Assembly, and announced shortly afterwards that pre-term elections would be held on 11 June. Meanwhile, seven candidates were officially registered to contest a presidential election, including Ðukanović (who was considered eligible to seek a further term in office, since his first term had been served prior to independence), former Minister of the Economy Milatović of ES!, Mandić of the DF and former Speaker Bečić of the DCG. At the first round of voting on 19 March, Ðukanović was first-placed with 35.4% of the votes cast, followed by Milatović with 28.9% and Mandić with 19.3%. Voter turnout of 64.1% was recorded. A second round was conducted on 2 April: Milatović (supported by the ruling parties and the unsuccessful first-round candidates) was elected to the presidency with 58.9% of votes cast, and a turnout of 70.1%. Milatović was sworn into office on 20 May. In the same month, following a dispute within the DF leadership, the dissolution of the alliance was announced.</p>
                         <p>
            In the pre-term legislative elections on 11 June 2023, ES! emerged as the largest parliamentary group, securing 25.5% of the votes cast and 24 seats in the Assembly, while a DPS-led coalition, Zajedno! Za Budoćnost Koja ti Pripada (Together! For the Future that Belongs to You), was placed second, with 23.2% of the votes and 21 seats. The coalition of pro-Serbian parties Za Budućnost Crne Gore, including former DF leader Mandić’s NOVA, obtained 14.7% of the votes and 13 seats, while an alliance comprising the DCG and the URA, Aleksa i Dritan-Hrabro se Broji! (Aleksa and Dritan—Count Bravely!), took 12.5% and 11 seats. A voter turnout of only 56.3% was recorded. Following lengthy negotiations, in October a coalition agreement was reached between ES!, the DCG, the SNP (which had won two seats in alliance) and smaller parties; the Za Budućnost Crne Gore coalition was to support the new administration, in exchange for the position of parliamentary Speaker, and for four ministerial posts in a reorganization envisaged to take place at the beginning of 2025. A new Government, under the premiership of ES! leader Spajić, was accordingly approved by 46 votes cast in the Assembly on 31 October 2023, one day after the election of Mandić as Speaker. The Government included five deputy premiers
            
            , among them Bečić of the DCG as Deputy Prime Minister for Security, Internal Policy and European and Foreign Affairs.
          </p>
                         <p>At its first session, the Government postponed a long-delayed population census scheduled to begin on 1 November for a period of 30 days, following demands by opposition parties, which urged their supporters to boycott the process due to concerns over transparency (and that the number of citizens identifying as Serb would be inflated). On 21 November Spajić and the opposition parties signed an agreement providing for greater opposition control over the census process. The population census finally proceeded on 3 December. In January 2024 the Assembly voted to appoint legal expert Milorad Marković as the new Supreme State Prosecutor (the post having remained vacant since mid-2021).</p>

            In March 2008 Prime Minister Ðukanović and his Croatian counterpart, meeting in Zagreb, Croatia, declared that the demarcation of the maritime boundary between the two countries around the Prevlaka peninsula (regulated by a 2002 interim agreement) would be referred to the 
            <xr pageref="Y" ref="IO-UN.527">International Court of Justice</xr>
             at The Hague, Netherlands. In October 2008 Montenegro officially recognized Kosovo as a sovereign state, following its declaration of independence on 17 February; Serbia expelled the Montenegrin ambassador, while pro-Serbian opposition parties protested in Podgorica to demand the organization of a referendum on the matter. In May 2009 President Vujanović visited the Serbian capital, Belgrade, in an effort to improve bilateral relations. In October Serbia finally accepted the Montenegrin Government’s nomination of a new ambassador. In December 2011 the Montenegrin, Albanian and Macedonian Governments signed an agreement providing for the abolition of border controls for citizens of their respective states.
          </p>
                         <p>A border demarcation process with Bosnia and Herzegovina was completed in November 2014. Tensions ensued after a resolution was proposed by an opposition deputy in the Bosnian state legislature in January 2015 to demand that the Montenegrin coastal area of Sutorina be ceded to Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, in May the Bosnian legislature rejected the resolution; bilateral relations were normalized and the border demarcation agreement was signed by the Governments of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro in Vienna, Austria, on 26 August. A border demarcation agreement between Montenegro and Kosovo was endorsed by a commission of international experts in March 2016, but remained an issue of intense disagreement between political parties in Kosovo; the Kosovo Government finally succeeded in securing parliamentary ratification of the agreement on 21 March 2018.</p>
                         <p>
            A diplomatic dispute erupted after the Montenegrin Government in November 2020 declared the Serbian ambassador to Montenegro 
            <i>persona non grata</i>
            , in response to his public statements referring to Montenegro’s 1918 unification with Serbia as an act of `liberation’. The new, pro-Serbian Government that took office on 4 December 2020 declared its intention to restore good bilateral relations, but refrained from reversing the decision on the expulsion. At the end of September 2022 the expelled former Serbian ambassador was among 28 foreign nationals subject to an entry ban imposed by the Montenegrin Government for `malign’ activity. The new Montenegrin President, Milatović, made an official visit to Serbia in July 2023, when he and his Serbian counterpart, Aleksandar Vučić, pledged to repair strained relations between the two countries. In October Montenegro’s Minister of Justice rejected a request from the Kosovo authorities for the extradition of two Kosovo Serbs for alleged crimes committed during the 1998-99 conflict in Kosovo, maintaining that adequate grounds for extradition had not been provided.

            Following independence in June 2006, Montenegro’s admission to international organizations proceeded rapidly. Montenegro was admitted to NATO’s Partnership for Peace’ programme in December, and became a member of the World Bank in the following month. Montenegro initialled a Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU in March 2007. In May Montenegro was admitted to the 
            <xr pageref="Y" ref="CE.IO">Council of Europe</xr>
            . Following the adoption of a new Constitution deemed to be in accordance with EU standards (see 
            <i>After Independence</i>
            ), the SAA was signed in October. In November 2009 it was announced that Montenegro had met EU requirements for the abolition of visa requirements, with effect from late December. The SAA with the EU entered into effect on 1 May 2010, and on 17 December the European Council granted Montenegro EU candidate status. After EU foreign ministers approved a recommendation of the European Commission, accession negotiations with Montenegro opened on 29 June 2012. The annual report by the European Commission issued in November 2023 cited limited reform progress, amid a protracted impasse in Montenegro’s political system (see 
            <i>Domestic Political Affairs</i>
            ). At February 2024 all 33 EU negotiating chapters had been opened and three provisionally closed. However, the new, pro-EU Prime Minister, Spajić, who made an official visit to Brussels, Belgium, in January, emphasized his commitment to the Government’s aspiration for Montenegro to attain full EU membership by 2028.
          </p>
                         <p>In December 2015 NATO foreign ministers officially invited Montenegro to begin accession negotiations; these opened on 15 February 2016. Montenegro was admitted to NATO on 5 June 2017.</p>
                         <p>Montenegro on 1 March 2022 joined wide-ranging EU sanctions imposed against the Russian Federation, following its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. However, on 9 March (by which time only a ban on Russian flights in Montenegro’s airspace had been confirmed) the EU urged Montenegro to suspend broadcasts of Russian state-controlled media outlets RT and Sputnik, in accordance with the restrictions. Meanwhile, the Montenegrin Government ordered the expulsion of a Russian diplomat; four further Russian diplomats were expelled in early April. Continued delays in implementing the sanctions against Russia were criticized by Montenegrin opposition parties and civic organizations. Sanctions, including the suspension of RT and Sputnik broadcasts, reportedly took effect in Montenegro in mid-April. On 29 September the Russian Government announced the indefinite closure of its consulate in Montenegro, in reprisal for the expulsion of six Russian diplomats by the Montenegrin authorities, amid an investigation into suspected espionage. Milorad Dodik, the President of the Republika Srpska entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina who had strong links with Russian President Vladimir Putin, made an unofficial visit to Montenegro to meet pro-Russia parliamentary Speaker Mandić in February 2024, prompting a protest at the parliamentary building.</p>

               <p>In 2022, according to estimates by the World Bank, Montenegro’s gross national income (GNI), measured at average 2020-22 prices, was US&#160;$6,407m., equivalent to $10,400 per head (or $27,530 per head on an international purchasing-power parity basis). During 2013-22, it was estimated, the population decreased at a negligible average annual rate, while gross domestic product (GDP) per head increased, in real terms, at an average annual rate of 2.7%. Overall GDP increased, in real terms, at an average annual rate of 2.6% in 2013-22; real GDP increased by 13.0% in 2021 and by 6.1% in 2022.

               <!--Population growth rate during 2010-19 was almost 0 percent. -->
               <p>Agriculture (including hunting, forestry and fishing) contributed 7.5% of GDP in 2022, according to official figures.

               <p>In 2022 Montenegro recorded a merchandise trade deficit of €2,670.1m., and there was a deficit of €766.0m. on the current account of the balance of payments. In 2022 the principal source of imports was Serbia (accounting for 17.4% of imports); other major sources were the People’s Republic of China, Greece, Germany, Croatia, Italy and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Montenegro’s total external debt was US&#160;$10,552m. in 2021, of which $4,288m. was public and publicly guaranteed debt. In that year, the cost of servicing long-term public and publicly guaranteed debt and repayments to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was equivalent to 48.2% of the value of exports of goods, services and income (excluding workers’ remittances). According to official figures, the annual rate of inflation averaged 3.3% in 2014-23; consumer prices increased by 13.0% in 2022 and by 8.6% in 2023. The rate of unemployment was 11.8% in July-September 2023.</p>
               <p>
        Rapid growth followed independence in 2006, based largely on capital growth and inflows of foreign direct investment. A Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) with the 
        <xr pageref="Y" ref="WB02047.IO.TXT">European Union (EU)</xr>
         entered into effect in May 2010, and EU accession negotiations opened in June 2012. Following the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, in April 2020 the Government announced support measures to mitigate the impact on businesses and workers. The IMF approved US&#160;$83.7m. in emergency assistance in June, and a €750m. Eurobond was issued to refinance public debt and fund new investment. Montenegro’s GDP fell by 15.3% in 2020 (the largest contraction in the region), owing to the damage to the tourism sector. However, GDP growth recovered strongly, at a rate of 13.0% in 2021, following the easing of COVID-19 entry restrictions and a rebound in tourist activity. In January 2022 the Government began to implement a new programme of reforms, which included a reduction in labour taxes and the introduction of a system of progressive taxation. The removal of remaining pandemic-related entry restrictions in March supported continued recovery in the tourism industry. However, the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine in February, and the consequent imposition of wide-ranging Western sanctions against Russia, led to elevated global food and energy prices, with inflation in Montenegro exceeding 17% by November. Meanwhile, an influx of both Ukrainian and Russian nationals to Montenegro as a result of the conflict contributed to higher domestic demand and foreign currency inflows. GDP growth was 6.4% in 2022 and remained strong, at an estimated 6.0% in 2023 (according to official figures), amid continued high private consumption and tourist activity that exceeded 2019 levels. In addition, the inflation rate was reduced to 4.3% by December 2023. On 1 March 2024 credit ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor’s revised Montenegro’s long-term outlook to positive from stable. Following delays in the formation of a Government after pre-term elections in mid-2023, the new Prime Minister in early 2024 affirmed the Government’s official commitment to pursuing a target for Montenegro to attain full EU membership by 2028.
