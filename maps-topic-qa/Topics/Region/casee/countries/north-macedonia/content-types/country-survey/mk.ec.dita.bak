          <heading>Introduction</heading>
          <p>North Macedonia (then known under its Constitution as the Republic of Macedonia) became a candidate for EU membership in December 2005, but formal accession negotiations with the EU were only launched in July 2022 (see History). The screening process for the Competitiveness and Inclusive Growth Cluster of laws as part of the negotiations commenced in October 2022, while the screening of the Internal Market Cluster was completed in March 2023. Over two decades since the country applied for EU membership, the EU has provided financial and technical assistance for pre-accession reform through its Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA, IPA II and IPA III), with annual support through the IPA III Action Plan amounting to €72.5m. in 2022.</p>

          <heading>Macroeconomic Performance</heading>
          <p>Gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average annual rate of 2.9% during 2013-19. However, in 2020 this strong performance was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated restrictive measures, which caused a 4.7% contraction in GDP and a 6.7% drop in industrial output in that year. The economy rebounded with GDP growth of 3.9% in 2021 and 2.2% in 2022, although industrial output remained subdued, increasing by only 0.9% in 2021 and declining by 1.5% in 2022. Unemployment continued its downward trend, falling to 14.4% in 2022, less than one-half its peak level of 31.4% in 2011. Gross fixed capital formation has been relatively stable, at around 22% of GDP. Exports of goods and services have increased to 74.9% of GDP in 2022 (from 66.2% in the previous year), although imports of goods and services were even higher, at 95.9% of GDP, the trade deficit being largely covered by an inflow of worker remittances from abroad. </p>

          <heading>Monetary Policy</heading>
          <p>Monetary policy has been designed to maintain a de facto exchange rate peg to the euro, reflecting the country’s openness to international trade and its history of high inflation during the early period of transition in the 1990s. Since 2010, the exchange rate has been fixed at about €1 = 61.7 denars, with a very narrow band of fluctuation. The fixed rate of exchange has been used as a nominal anchor to stabilize the price level and to create confidence among investors, both domestic and foreign. The policy succeeded in restraining inflation, which was at a rate of just 1.2% in 2020 and remained a low level thereafter; however, as elsewhere, inflationary pressures have been rising since the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the inflation rate reached 14.1% in that year.</p>
          <p>In pursuit of the objective of price stability, the National Bank of the Republic of North Macedonia (NBRNM) implements its monetary policy by periodically adjusting its policy interest rate and determining the reserve requirements of the commercial banks. In order to influence the interest rate set by commercial banks, the NBRNM carries out open-market operations which include the sale and purchase of treasury bills through regular auctions, as well as the purchase and sale of other securities through outright transactions. The policy interest rate was stable at 3.75% from 2013 until February 2018, after which it was progressively lowered to 1.25% by the end of 2021, before rising to 2.0% in July 2022. At that time, the average bank lending rate was 8.55% in local currency and 3.38% in foreign currency. </p>
          <p>The NBRNM also sets reserve requirements for the banking system, at a rate of 8% for domestic currency deposits (liabilities), 50% for bank liabilities with a foreign exchange clause, and 15% for liabilities in foreign currency. In 2022 the total loans provided by the commercial banking sector to the economy and households increased by 9.4%. The proportion of non-performing loans in the banking sector (a measure of financial distress) accounted for 3.2% of total loans, far lower than in the period following the eurozone crisis a decade earlier. In 2022 broad money supply increased by 5.3%.</p>
          <p>A further aim of monetary policy has been to reduce the excessive euroization of the economy. Measures taken to that end have included the introduction of differentiated reserve requirements for local currency and foreign currency liabilities, a cap on the daily net open foreign currency positions of banks, and a requirement for banks to identify large unhedged foreign currency borrowers. These measures have succeeded in gradually reducing the share of deposits and credits in foreign currencies—an important achievement that has somewhat reduced foreign exchange rate risk to the economy.</p>

          <heading>Fiscal Policy</heading>
          <p>Fiscal policy has sought to minimize the role of government in the economy. As a result, the share of public revenues as a proportion of GDP (at just 29%) is among the lowest in Europe. A flat tax was introduced in 2007, set at the rate of 10% for personal and corporate income tax. In 2019 the new Government signalled its decision to move to a more conventional approach to economic policy by introducing a progressive personal income tax. Two rates of tax were introduced: 10% for incomes of up to 90,000 denars per month (about €1,500) and 18% for incomes above that level. The reform was introduced with the aim of reducing income inequality by redistributing income. However, owing to widespread tax evasion by higher income earners, the reform was suspended in January 2020 for a period of 36 months.</p>
          <p>
      The largest contribution to public revenues is made by value-added tax (VAT), which accounted for 
      <!--2022 figs from stats-->
      48.5% of tax revenue in 2022. It is set at 18%, with a preferential rate of 5% on some goods. Excise taxes are charged on energy products and electricity, tobacco goods and alcoholic beverages, which together contributed 19.1% of tax revenue in 2022. Personal income tax accounted for 16.1% of tax revenue in that year, while profit tax provided a further 9.5%. Customs duties are extremely low due to the policy of trade liberalization (goods and services from the EU are imported without customs duty) and contributed only 6.3% of tax revenue.
    </p>
          <p>Social security contributions are calculated on gross salaries of insured persons and contribute 30% of total public revenues. Since January 2020 social contributions have been set at 18.8% for pension insurance, 7.5% for health insurance, 1.2% for unemployment insurance, and 0.5% for additional health insurance. Contributions are capped at a level of 16 times the average gross salary. Pension contributions comprise 68% of total social revenue, health contributions 28% and unemployment contributions just 4%.</p>
          <p>Property taxes are accrued to the municipalities as their main source of income under fiscal decentralization arrangements. Municipalities also benefit from a local property tax set at 0.1%-0.2% of property values, and a property transfer tax of 2%-4% of property values. Inheritance taxes are charged on real property at a rate of 2%-5% of the value of the property.</p>
          <p>Foreign investors benefit from a range of tax exemptions within designated export processing zones, known as Technological Industrial Development Zones (TIDZ). Subsidies to attract multinational companies include: zero customs duties or VAT on imported goods or equipment (compared with the standard 18%); zero profit tax for up to 10 years (compared with the standard 10%); subsidies to build a factory of up to €500,000; employment subsidies amounting to up to 50% of gross wages; and 50% of justified investment costs up to €50m.</p>
          <p>Given the low level of tax revenue, government expenditure has been restrained. The budget deficit has also been kept at a low level, equivalent to only 2% of GDP in 2019. However, in 2020 the budget deficit increased dramatically to 8.1% of GDP, reflecting the fiscal measures introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and a reduction in tax revenues. This rise was partly corrected when the budget deficit fell to 5.4% of GDP in 2021 and to 4.1% in 2022. The overall level of general government gross debt (public debt) was 53.2% of GDP in 2021, and although this had increased from previous years it was still a relatively low level for an emerging European economy.</p>

          <heading>International Economic Relations</heading>
          <p>North Macedonia is an open economy with a high level of international trade, foreign investment and international financial flows. The country signed a Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) with the European Union (EU) in April 2001; an Interim Agreement established asymmetric trade liberalization with the EU immediately, and the agreement entered into full force in 2004. The SAA removed customs duties and quantitative restrictions on exports to the EU, and on imports from the EU at a later stage.</p>
          <p>North Macedonia habitually records a deficit on the current account of the balance of payments, which amounted to €772m. in 2022. The deficit was particularly high in goods trade at €3,453m., accompanied by an outflow of primary income (mainly the outflow of profits on foreign direct investment—FDI) of €558m. These outflows were partly offset by a surplus in trade in services of €741m. and a large inflow of secondary income (mainly in the form of worker remittances from migrants abroad) amounting to €2,498m. On the financial account there was an inflow of FDI amounting to €670m., which was not much more than the outflow of primary income on the current account. Together with other changes to the financial account, foreign reserves increased by €219m. over 2022.</p>
          <p>The country’s most important export partners are the EU member states, which account for some 62% of exports, while other countries of the Western Balkan region take around 30% of exports. Germany was the principal market for exports in 2022, accounting for 45.1% of the total, according to preliminary data, while the principal source of imports in that year was the United Kingdom, providing 15.8% of the total. A possible explanation for this skewed geographical distribution of trade is the presence of several German companies in the special economic zones (Technological Industrial Development Zones), together with one major company from the UK, which specializes in producing motor car components.</p>
          <p>The major export products are machinery and transport equipment, and chemicals and related products, which together accounted for around 57% of total exports by value in 2022 (according to preliminary data). Basic manufactures represented a further 15% of exports, and miscellaneous manufactured articles 10%. Together, these four sub-sectors provided more than four-fifths of total goods exports. Agricultural products and processed food products accounted for a relatively small share of total exports. Imports are similarly focused on manufactured goods, while mineral fuels and lubricants contributed around 18% of the total.</p>
          <p>Both the Government and the private sector have borrowed heavily on international capital markets to cover the current account deficit, with the result that gross external debt increased further to 84.2% of GDP in 2022 (from 81.9% in the previous year), exceeding the previous high of 74.7% of GDP in 2016. This increased burden of external debt is likely to be difficult to sustain, as global interest is expected to rise in the coming years.</p>

          <heading>The Development of the Private Sector</heading>
          <p>Most former socially owned enterprises were privatized in the 1990s, apart from the very largest enterprises and the utility companies. The telecommunications industry was privatized in 2001, but the state still retains ownership of the electricity generation and transmission companies. More recently, non-core units of some public enterprises, such as railway maintenance, were offered for sale. The private sector is now the major part of the economy, which is dominated by micro-firms. Almost four-fifths of the 73,000 private companies employ fewer than 10 workers, while most of the remainder employ fewer than 50 workers. There are about 1,400 medium-sized companies employing between 50 and 249 workers, and 234 large companies employing more than 250 workers. About 3,000 companies collapsed during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
          <p>
      As EU-compatible laws have been gradually introduced, the business environment for private enterprises has improved. In 2020 North Macedonia was placed 17th out of 190 countries (the highest ranked country in the region) in the World Bank’s 
      <i>Ease of Doing Business</i>
       index. However, this does not reflect the real picture of the business environment in North Macedonia. In 2021 the World Bank ceased publication of the index, due to widespread misreporting by governments eager to improve their international standing. In practice, the environment is not conducive to doing business, especially for small business start-ups. Institutional capacity to enforce commercial law is weak and resolving a business dispute through the courts is time-consuming and costly. The Government claims to be committed to reducing the number of unannounced inspections and the amount of so-called para-fiscal fees on private business activities.
    </p>
          <p>Since 2010 the Government has introduced several reforms to improve the position of the private business sector. The 2012-20 Innovation Strategy aimed to create a knowledge-based economy, and in early 2014 the Fund for Innovation and Technology Development was launched to stimulate research and development activity in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The Fund financed projects in information and communications technology, agriculture, tourism and renewable energy. In 2018 the Government adopted an SME Strategy (2018-23), containing 12 programmes that were to be implemented by the Agency for the Promotion of Entrepreneurship.</p>

          <heading>Foreign Direct Investment</heading>
          <p>Acceptance as a candidate for EU membership in 2005 changed international investors’ perceptions of the country and led to increased inflows of FDI. During the six years before the global economic crisis the average annual inflow of FDI was equivalent to 5.0% of GDP, although this fell somewhat following the economic crisis and as the country’s EU accession prospects stalled. FDI inflows reached €670m., equivalent to 5.2% of GDP, in 2022, recovering to the level of inflows before the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
          <p>The main inflows of FDI have come from a diverse group of countries, notably Germany and Austria. The real origin of investment is to some extent disguised by the use of offshore tax havens, as indicated by the fact that the third largest inflow was from companies registered in St Vincent and the Grenadines. Other non-transparent FDI inflows came from Luxembourg and the British Virgin Islands. Most FDI has been invested in services, which has accounted for around 45% of the total, while some 25% has been invested in manufacturing. Within the manufacturing sector, foreign investors are primarily involved in vehicles and transport equipment, basic metals and machinery products. This reflects the emphasis within the TIDZ export processing zones on the supply of components for the global automotive industry. Within the services sector, foreign investors have mainly been involved in financial services and in wholesale and retail trade.</p>
          <p>Johnson Controls of Ireland was the first company to invest in the TIDZ in Skopje, with a US&#160;$40m. plant to assemble electronic dashboard components. They were followed by other investors who between them created a significant number of new jobs in the industrial zones. In December 2015 Cap-Con Automotive Technologies of the USA commenced the production of inflators and airbags with a €17m. investment employing workers at the Skopje industrial zone, and in February 2016 the Vitillo Group of Italy began the second stage of its investment in the production of high-pressure hydraulic fittings and armoured rubber hoses, increasing its total investment to €30m., creating 300 jobs. Other notable companies based in TIDZ include Johnson Matthey, a UK based company producing catalytic converters for the motor car industry and Van Hool, a Belgian company that produces buses and coaches.</p>

          <heading>Principal Sectors</heading>
          <p>Economic growth is based on a few principal sectors. In 2022 some 25.5% of GDP was generated by industry (mining and utilities, manufacturing and construction), and around 24.5% by wholesale and retail trade, repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles, transportation and storage, and hotels and restaurants. Within the manufacturing sector, the country has strengths in the areas of ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgy, the machinery, automotive and electrical equipment industry, chemicals, textiles, processed food and beverages, and the construction industry. The metallurgical industry has a long tradition, owing to the presence of natural resources such as nickel, lead, zinc and precious metals. This has attracted investment by leading international companies, such as ArcelorMittal, Duferco and IMM. Although the automotive and electrical equipment industries contracted following independence, investors such as Johnson Matthey have begun to revive the fortunes of the sector. In the chemicals sector, large companies such as the pharmaceuticals company Alkaloid have prospered. The textiles sector is a major employer, engaging about one-fifth of the industrial workforce. Among food-processing industries, processed vegetables and bottled juices are produced for both domestic consumption and export, despite strong foreign competition. Almost three-quarters of output of the wine sector is exported to other European countries. The tobacco sector is also significant, with high-quality raw materials and major international investors such as Imperial Tobacco, which operates a cigarette factory.</p>
          <p>North Macedonia’s financial sector has strengthened and deepened. Banks with majority foreign ownership have increased their market share to more than 85% of total assets. Banks rely mainly on domestic deposits rather than international credit lines to fund lending and consequently are relatively insulated from global economic fluctuations. Overall, the banking system remains robust, with strong capital and liquidity buffers.</p>

          <heading>The Labour Market</heading>
          <p>Nominal wage growth reflects robust economic growth and the effects of a tightening labour market. The highest average monthly gross wages per sector are earned in the information and communications sector (105,000 denars—about €1,700) and in financial services (74,000 denars—about €1,2000). The lowest average monthly wages were paid in accommodation and food service activities (37,000 denars—about €600). The minimum monthly wage is the equivalent of €330. </p>
          <p>Over the last decade employment has been on an upward trajectory; the total number of employed persons increased from 623,000 in 2009 to 692,000 in 2022, about one-quarter of whom are employed in the public sector. Unemployment has historically been high, even during the socialist period. Following independence and the difficult period of transition, the unemployment rate peaked at around 37% in the mid-2000s. Since then, however, the unemployment rate has fallen steadily, even during periods of economic crisis, from 32% in 2009 to under 15% in 2022. Long-term unemployment remains a problem, with around 80% of the unemployed being out of work for over 12 months. Youth unemployment is also very high, at 36% for those aged 15-24 years in 2021. The rate of young people neither in employment, education nor training (NEET) was 26% in 2020, compared with the EU average of 12%. A main reason for this high NEET rate is that young people are exposed to poor and lengthy transitions from school to work, partly owing to the inadequacies of the education system which often fails to provide skills relevant for the labour market, leading to high levels of skills mismatch among employees. The COVID-19 pandemic also adversely affected the job prospects of young people, who were more likely than older workers to be employed in the informal sector or in service-sector activities.</p>
          <p>A National Employment Strategy 2021-27 sets out the policy priorities for the labour market over the coming years. The Strategy aims to boost economic development, create jobs and reduce unemployment especially among the most vulnerable, including youth, the long-term unemployed and minorities. It is also designed to address informal employment, improve the quality of public employment services, and strengthen social dialogue at both the national and local levels. Active labour market measures are to become more focused on supporting young people in finding jobs. A Youth Guarantee provides unemployed young people under the age of 29 with an adequate job offer, an opportunity to continue education, or inclusion in an internship or training programme within four months of registering at the Employment Agency. Job subsidies and relaxed criteria for access to unemployment benefits which were introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic have been retained to support job creation and the incomes of the unemployed. The strategy also aims to improve funding for the education system and reform vocational education and adult training to reduce skills mismatch, and introduce a progressive taxation system to discourage working in the informal economy. In order to achieve these objectives, the staff of the Employment Agency are to be increased.</p>

          <heading>Social Protection</heading>
          <p>In 2020 GDP per head was just 17% of the EU-27 average in nominal terms but, due to the low cost of living in North Macedonia, in comparable purchasing-power parity (PPP) terms it was almost two-fifths (38%) of the EU average. With regard to the standard of living, individual consumption expenditure per head in PPP terms was almost one-half (47%) of the EU-27 average.</p>
          <p>In 2020 almost one-third of the population were at risk of monetary poverty before social transfers or pensions. When pensions are included, the `at risk of poverty’ rate fell to 26%, indicating the important role of pensions in protecting the living standards of the elderly population. There is a substantial regional variation in poverty levels, which are higher in the north-eastern region than elsewhere. The most vulnerable ethnic group is the Roma, of whom two-thirds live below the poverty line. Family size, unemployment, the level of education and a rural location are the most significant indicators of poverty risk. Despite widespread poverty and the extensive need for social assistance, state financial support for the poor in the form of social cash benefits that would secure a minimum level of subsistence is inadequate.</p>
          <p>Incomes are unequally distributed, with the top 20% of income earners earning 5.9 times as much as the bottom 20%, a higher income quintile ratio than the EU-27 average of 4.9. However, the Gini coefficient for equivalized disposable income (under which a measure of 0 indicates perfect equality and one of 100 perfect inequality) is 30.0, similar to the 31.4 recorded for the EU-27. Taken together, the two measures suggest that income inequality is concentrated in the extremes, with unduly high incomes at the top of society and unduly low incomes at the bottom. In between, incomes are distributed similarly to other European market economies.</p>
          <p>North Macedonia has a three-pillar pension system. The reform of the state-funded pay-as-you-go first pillar state pension involved an increase in the retirement age to 64 years for men and 62 years for women, a decrease in the replacement rate, a change in pension indexation to the `Swiss’ model (50% wage inflation and 50% price inflation), the ending of early retirement and a change to the pension formula. The privately managed and fully funded second pillar, introduced in 2006, is compulsory for new entrants to the labour market, who are required to pay 7% of their salary to one of two private pension funds. The first pillar provides only a modest state pension, with an estimated replacement rate of previous salaries of 30%. It can be supplemented by the pension derived from investments in the voluntary third-pillar private pension funds. Total spending on the state pension is about 5.7% of GDP, well below the EU-27 average of 9.6% (although the age profile of the population is younger, with 15% of the population aged over 65 compared with 21% in the EU-27). The indexation method was changed in 2019 to reflect price inflation alone, with no wage inflation component, with the aim of reducing the deficit in the Pension Fund. At the same time, a means-tested social pension was introduced for the poorest pensioners, setting the minimum pension at 24% of the average net wage.</p>

          <heading>Education</heading>
          <p>North Macedonia’s expenditure on education is equivalent to around 3.5% of GDP, compared with 4.7% in the EU-27. Education reforms have focused on improving school infrastructure by renovating school buildings and increasing the amount of information technology equipment in schools. This has been accompanied by extending primary education from eight to nine years and revising the curricula. Educational outcomes are worse than in most neighbouring countries. According to the 2018 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), only 39% of pupils in that year achieved a level 2 or higher score in Mathematics, while 45% did so in Reading, and 51% in Science (compared with 76%, 77% and 78%, respectively, in the OECD). Nevertheless, the absolute scores achieved by pupils in North Macedonia in these three subjects showed an improvement from the previous PISA tests in 2015. Another area of improvement was early school leaving, a phenomenon which primarily affects young people in rural areas and from the Roma minority, with the proportion of pupils leaving school before completing compulsory primary education falling from 19.6% in 2008 to just 7.1% in 2018.</p>
          <p>Another problematic area is higher education. In 2020 only 38% of those aged 25-34 years had completed tertiary education (compared with 40.5% in the EU-27), although this was a substantial improvement compared with a decade earlier. There is a large gender disparity, with only 31.6% of men in the same age group having completed tertiary education, compared with 44.4% of women. In recent years several private universities have enrolled many students, making it easier to obtain a diploma. As a consequence, the gross enrolment rate at tertiary level has risen to levels above those in more developed EU countries, although the quality of the education received is sometimes questionable. University graduates often encounter difficulties in finding suitable employment; the unemployment rate for university graduates was 13.7% in 2020. Legislation on adult education has been adopted and an Adult Education Council has been established to support lifelong learning.</p>
          <p>The Government has adopted an education strategy for 2018-25. It covers all fields of education and aims to develop an inclusive and integrated education system by focusing on outcomes instead of rote learning, in order to make learning more relevant to the needs of employers and the labour market prospects of school leavers and graduates.</p>

          <heading>Health Services</heading>
          <p>The COVID-19 pandemic had a severe impact, as the public health service was poorly equipped to cope with the crisis. The disease had caused almost 10,000 cumulative deaths by May 2023. The primary health care system was privatized in 2005, while the secondary health care sector has been opened up to private providers. The private sector has expanded due to the low quality of health care provided in public sector hospitals, and caters mainly to those able to pay directly for high quality health services. Private hospitals include a number of specialized hospitals for cardiac surgery, gynaecology and obstetrics, as well as one private general hospital. They provide services for both private patients and for patients referred by the public sector whose treatment is paid for by the HIF. While North Macedonia’s performance has been improving, it lags behind EU averages on all health indicators. </p>
          <p>The Law on Health Insurance of 2000 and the Law on Health Care of 2012 (amended in 2013 and 2015) set out the foundations of the health care system, which is based on the principle of free access at the point of delivery. The public Health Insurance Fund (HIF) is an independent public agency financed through social health contributions paid by employees and supervised by the Ministry of Health. The HIF purchases health services from public and private providers at each level of the health care system through performance contracts based on capitation payments at the primary care level and diagnosis-related groups at secondary and tertiary levels. Total health expenditure amounts to some 7.3% of GDP, of which two-fifths is private health expenditure in the form of co-payments for public sector prescriptions and private sector health care services. The public health care system has been associated with significant risks in pharmaceutical procurement and the less than fully transparent operation of the HIF and health care institutions. Health planning has overemphasized in-patient care in hospitals to the detriment of more cost-effective primary care services in the community. In the public health care system, additional informal payments to the doctor are a normal expectation, constituting an obstacle to accessing public health services for low-income families.</p>

          <heading>Housing</heading>
          <p>Three-fifths of the population live in urban areas, around one-half of whom live in the capital city, Skopje. Privatization of housing began in the early 1990s, when the prices of houses sold to families by the Government were heavily discounted, and about 86% of the population live in owner-occupied accommodation without a mortgage. Since the average young person cannot afford to buy a new home, many young people live in their parents’ house making overcrowding a primary cause of poor living conditions; the overcrowding rate is estimated to be 42%.</p>
          <p>Owing to poor maintenance many housing units are substandard and need to be replaced or rebuilt. Some 13% of the population live in a dwelling with a leaking roof, damp walls, floors or foundations, or rot in the window frames or floor. This proportion is higher for large families of two adults with three or more children, almost one-quarter of whom live in substandard housing of this type. Roma households face especially poor housing conditions, and often lack access to potable water and sewerage. Skopje hosts squatter settlements of about 120,000 citizens, many of whom are Roma.</p>

          <heading>Economic Outlook</heading>
          <p>The positive economic performance that the country achieved over the decade prior to the COVID-19 pandemic was driven by an increase in foreign investment and exports, generating a surge in new jobs and a consequent rapid fall in unemployment, although youth and long-term unemployment remained a problem. The business environment improved owing to structural reforms, as did the competitiveness of the economy, although problems remain with bureaucracy and access to finance for small businesses. The banking system has been stable, as it is mainly a deposit-based system with little exposure to mortgage debt, while the share of non-performing loans fell. The trade deficit was covered by remittances from Macedonian workers abroad, and the current account deficit by inflows of FDI, although this was largely offset by an outflow of profits. However, these positive developments were interrupted by the external shock from the COVID-19 pandemic and the restrictive measures adopted to counter it. As a result, the economy experienced a recession in 2020, with GDP falling for the first time in a decade and external debt increasing to unsustainable levels. GDP growth recovered in 2021 and 2022; however, the resumption of the previous strong rates of growth is predicted only if rising external debt is brought under control and the global crisis precipitated by the war in Ukraine is resolved. Bulgaria’s veto on the opening of North Macedonia’s EU accession negotiations (see History) was lifted in July 2022, prompting a new influx of FDI which rebounded strongly in that year, along with associated technology transfer. Meanwhile, public expenditure on health and education should also be increased to raise the level of human capital and productivity of the economy in order to ensure sustainable growth in the future.</p>
