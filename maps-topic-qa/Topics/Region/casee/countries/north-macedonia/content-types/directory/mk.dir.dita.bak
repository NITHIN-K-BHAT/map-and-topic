                    <p id="MK.DIR.3">The Constitution was promulgated on 17 November 1991. The following is a summary of the main provisions of the Constitution, as subsequently amended:</p>

                         <heading>General Provisions</heading>
                         <p id="MK.DIR.5">The Republic of North Macedonia is a sovereign, independent, democratic state, where sovereignty derives from democratically elected citizens, referendums and other forms of expression. State power is divided between legislative, executive and judicial bodies. The Republic respects the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of neighbouring states.</p>

                         <heading>Basic Rights</heading>
                         <p id="MK.DIR.7">The following rights and freedoms are guaranteed and protected in the Republic: the right to life, the inviolability of each person’s physical and moral integrity, the right to freedom of speech, public appearance, public information, belief, conscience and religion, and the freedom to organize and belong to a trade union or a political party.</p>
                         <p id="MK.DIR.8">The Macedonian language is the official language in use throughout the Republic of North Macedonia. Any other language spoken by at least 20% of the population in a locality is also an official language. Legislation approved in 2018 and which came into force in 2019 also extended official status to the Albanian language.</p>
                         <p id="MK.DIR.10">Any citizen who has reached the age of 18 years has the right to vote and to be elected to organs of government. The right to vote is equal, general and direct, and is realized in free elections by secret ballot. The proportional representation of each community must be assured in the public services and in all areas of public life. Citizens enjoy equal freedoms and rights without distinction. All religious creeds are separate from the state and are equal under the law.</p>

                              <p id="MK.DIR.13">Legislative power resides with the Sobranie (Assembly), which consists of between 120 and 140 deputies elected for four years. The Assembly adopts and amends the Constitution, enacts laws and gives interpretations thereof, adopts the budget of the Republic, decides on war and peace, chooses the Government, and elects judges and releases them from duty. The Assembly may decide to call a referendum on issues within its competence. A decision is adopted at a referendum if the majority of voters taking part in the ballot votes in favour of it and if more than one-half of the electorate participates in the vote. The Assembly forms a Council for Inter-Ethnic Relations, comprising seven representatives from each of the ethnic Macedonian and Albanian communities, and five representatives of other nationalities living in the Republic. Parliamentary legislation on issues of culture and identity, particularly in the areas of language and education, can only be adopted if a majority of the deputies representing these communities votes in favour, in addition to the overall majority. Three of the nine judges of the Constitutional Court and three of the seven members of the Republican Judicial Council must also be elected by a double majority vote.</p>
