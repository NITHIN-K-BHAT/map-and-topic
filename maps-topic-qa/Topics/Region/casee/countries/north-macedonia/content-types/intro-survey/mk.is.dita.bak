               <p id="MK.IS.3">The Republic of North Macedonia, known as the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia (FYRM or, according to its Constitution, the Republic of Macedonia) until February 2019, is situated in South-Eastern Europe. It is bounded by Serbia to the north, Kosovo to the north-west, Albania to the west, Greece to the south and Bulgaria to the east. The republic is predominantly mountainous with a continental climate, although the Vardar (Axios) river valley, which bisects the country from north-west to south-east, across the centre of the republic and into Greece, has a mild Mediterranean climate with an average summertime temperature of 27°C (80°F). The official language of the republic, under the Constitution of November 1991, was Macedonian, a South Slavic language closely related to Bulgarian, and which is most frequently written in the Cyrillic script. Minority languages, most notably Albanian, were accorded the status of official language in communities where its speakers constituted at least 20% of the population. The official use of Albanian was extended under a language law adopted in 2018. Most of the population is nominally Eastern Orthodox Christian. Most ethnic Albanians (around one-quarter of the population) are Muslims, as are the majority of the other minority groups. The national flag (proportions 1 by 2) com­prises, in the centre of a red field, a yellow disc, with eight yellow rays extending to the edges of the flag. The capital is Skopje.</p>

                    <heading>Historical Context</heading>
                    <p id="MK.IS.5">After the First World War, during which Macedonia was occupied by Bulgaria and the Central Powers of Austria-Hungary and Germany, Vardar Macedonia—the area now known as the Republic of North Macedonia—became part of the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (formally named Yugoslavia in 1929). In the Second World War, however, the Bulgarian occu­pation of 1941-44 disillusioned many Yugoslav Macedonians. From 1943 the Partisans of Josip Broz (Tito), the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Yugo­slavia, began to gain support in the region, and after the war the new Federal People’s Republic of Yugoslavia and its communist rulers resolved to include a Macedonian nation as a federal partner. A distinct Macedonian identity was promoted, together with a linguistic policy that encouraged the establishment of a Macedonian literary language distinct from Bulgarian.</p>
                    <p id="MK.IS.6">The presence of a large ethnic Albanian minority in western Macedonia added to Macedonian insecurities. The proximity of the neighbouring Serbian province of Kosovo, with a majority ethnic Albanian population, and demands, from the late 1960s, for the creation of an Albanian republic within Yugoslavia, alarmed the Macedonian au­thorities, which became particularly active against Albanian nationalism from 1981. In 1989 the republican Constitution was amended to allow the intro­duction of a multi-party system; Macedonia was declared to be a nation state of the ethnic Macedonians, and mention of the Albanian and Turkish minorities was excluded.</p>

                    <p id="MK.IS.8">In November and December 1990 the first multi-party elections to a unicameral Sobranie (Assembly) were held in Macedonia. The Vnatrešno-Makedonska Revolucionerna Organizacija-Demokratska Partija za Makedonsko Nacionalno Edinstvo (VMRO-DPMNE, Internal Macedonian Revolu­tionary Organization-Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity), led by Ljubčo Georg­ievski, emerged as the single party with the most seats (37) in the 120-member Assembly. The republican branch of the former ruling party, the Sojuz na Komunistite na Makedonija-Partija za Demokratska Preobrazda (SKM-PDP, League of Communists of Macedonia-Party for Demo­cratic Reform), led by Petar Gosev, won 31 seats, and the Partia për Prosperitet Demokratik (PPD—the Party for Democratic Prosperity), together with another predominantly Albanian party, 25. The republican branch of the federal Savez Reformskih Snaga (Alliance of Reformist Forces, subsequently the Liberalna Partija na Makedonija—LPM—Liberal Party of Macedonia) won 19 seats. In January 1991 Kiro Gligorov of the SKM-PDP was elected President of the Republic, with Georgievski as Vice-President. The three parties agreed to support a government largely comprising members without political affiliation. In March the Assembly approved a new administration, headed by Nikola Kljušev. The SKM-PDP was renamed the Socijaldemokratski Sojuz na Makedonija (SDSM—Social Demo­cratic Alliance of Macedonia) in April.</p>

                         <heading>Efforts to Secure International Recognition</heading>
                         <p id="MK.IS.9">On 25 January 1991 the Assembly unanimously adopted a motion declaring the republic a sovereign territory. After June declarations of Croatian and Slovenian dissociation’ from Yugoslavia, Macedonia, wary of the increasing Serbian domination of the remaining federal institutions, declared its neutrality. On 8 September a referendum (boycotted by the ethnic Albanian population) approved the sovereignty of Macedonia.</p>
                         <p id="MK.IS.10">Georgievski resigned the Vice-Presidency in October 1991, and the VMRO-DPMNE announced that it had joined the opposition, stating that the party had been excluded from the decision-making process. On 17 November the Constitution, which declared the sovereignty of the Republic of Macedonia, was endorsed by 96 of the 120 Assembly members. In January 1992 an unofficial referendum conducted among the ethnic Albanian population reportedly resulted in 99.9% of the votes being cast in favour of territorial and political autonomy for the ethnic Albanian population. The complete withdrawal of federal troops from Macedonia in March effectively signalled Yugoslav acceptance of Macedonian secession from the fed­eration.</p>
                         <p id="MK.IS.12">
            Macedonian affairs were subsequently dominated by efforts to secure wider international recognition. Bulgaria recognized the state of Macedonia in January 1992, closely followed by Turkey (now Türkiye) in February, provoking mass protests in Thessaloniki, the capital of the Greek region of Macedonia. The Greek authorities insisted that `Macedonia’ was a geographical term delineating an area that included a large part of northern Greece, and ex­pressed fears that the republic’s independence under the name `Macedonia’ might foster claims to future territorial expansion. Greece was instrumental in the formulation of a European Community (EC, now European Union—
            <xr pageref="Y" ref="WB02047.IO.TXT">EU</xr>
            ) policy that the republic should not be awarded formal recognition of independence until stringent constitutional requirements had been fulfilled. In July, after a motion expressing no confidence in the Government (and following large demonstrations against its failure to gain international recognition for an inde­pendent Macedonia), the Government resigned. The VMRO-DPMNE failed to form a new alliance, and eventually in September Branko Crvenkovski, the Chairman of the SDSM, was installed as Prime Minister of a coalition Government.

                         <p id="MK.IS.13">
            The adoption of a new flag in August 1992 attracted opposition from Greece, which objected to the depiction outside Greece of the `Vergina Star’ (regarded as an ancient Greek symbol of Philip of Macedon and Alexander the Great). In February 1993 Greece agreed to international arbitration over the issue of Macedonia’s name. On 8 April the republic was admitted to the United Nations (UN) under the temporary name of the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia’ (FYRM), pending settlement of the issue of a permanent name. However, Greece con­tinued to assert that the use of the Vergina Star and the name `Macedonia’ implied territorial claims on Greek territory, and in October Greece withdrew from UN-sponsored negoti­ations on the question of a permanent name. In January 1994 Greece requested that the other nations of the EU prevail upon the FYRM (which was, by this time, recognized by all the other EU member states) to make concessions concerning its name, flag and Constitution. From February Greece blocked all non-humanitarian shipments to the FYRM through the port of Thessaloniki, and also road and rail transport links with the FYRM. In April the European Commission initiated legal proceedings against Greece at the Court of Justice of the European Communities. In April 1995 the Court issued a preliminary opinion that the embargo was not in breach of Greece’s obligations under the Treaty of Rome. Meanwhile, Greece agreed to resume negotiations in April with the FYRM, under the auspices of the UN; in May the 
            <xr pageref="Y" ref="OSCE.IO">Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)</xr>
             announced that it was to join the mediation efforts. On 13 September the FYRM Minister of Foreign Affairs and his Greek counterpart signed an interim accord, providing for the mutual recognition of existing frontiers and respect for the sovereignty of each state, and for the free movement of goods and people. Greece was to end its trade embargo and veto on the FYRM’s entry into international organ­izations, while the FYRM undertook to abandon its use of the Vergina emblem, and to amend parts of its Constitution that had been regarded by Greece as irredentist; the question of a permanent name for the FYRM was to be the subject of further negoti­ations. In early October the Assembly approved a new state flag, which did not use the Vergina emblem. The interim accord entered into force on 13 October, and the border between the two countries was reopened.

                         <heading>Ethnic Albanian Insurgency</heading>
                         <p id="MK.IS.16">The PPD split in February 1994, when a faction led by Deputy President of the Assembly Xheladin Murati and including the party’s representatives in the Government and in the legislature, withdrew from the party’s congress. The remaining grouping, led by Arben Xhaferi, made more radical demands. Meanwhile, after the Government announced that it had discovered a conspiracy to establish an Albanian republic in the west of the FYRM, in June Mithat Emini, the former General Secretary of the PPD, was sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment, while nine others received custodial sentences. The sentencing of Emini and his co-defendants prompted ethnic Albanian deputies to boycott the Assembly in July. Murati resigned later that month, and was succeeded as party leader by Abdurahman Aliti.</p>
                         <p id="MK.IS.17">Gligorov, representing the Sojuz za Makedonija (SZM—Alliance for Macedonia, a coalition of the SDSM, the LPM and the Socijalistiska Partija na Makedonija—SPM—Socialist Party of Macedonia), was re-elected President on 16 October 1994, winning 78.4% of the valid votes cast, defeating Georgievski. A first round of voting to the new Assembly took place on the same day. The VMRO-DPMNE, failing to secure any seats, alleged widespread electoral fraud, and boycotted the second round of legislative voting on 30 October. The final results confirmed that the SZM had won the majority of seats in the Assembly. Aliti’s wing of the PPD, which had been legally recognized as the successor to the original party, secured 10 seats. An SDSM-led administration under Crvenkovski was approved by the Assembly in December. In October 1995 Gligorov was injured in a car bomb attack in Skopje; he resumed full presidential duties in January 1996. The SZM coalition collapsed in February, and a new Government that excluded the LPM was formed. Meanwhile, ethnic tensions were exacerbated by the opening in February 1995 of an Albanian-language university in the western town of Tetovo. An ethnic Albanian was killed in clashes with security forces. In July 1996 five of the university’s founders, including its rector, received custodial sentences for inciting the riots, prompting further protests.</p>
                         <p id="MK.IS.23">In May 1997 protests were staged in the western town of Gostivar against a Constitutional Court ruling prohibiting the use of the Albanian flag in the country. Following VMRO-DPMNE demonstrations in Skopje to demand the resignation of the Government, a reorganized administration headed by Crvenkovski was approved by the Assembly at the end of May. In July the Assembly adopted legislation stipulating that the use of flags representing minority ethnic groups would only be permitted on national holidays, with the state flag being displayed at the same time. The mayors of Gostivar and Tetovo refused to comply with the order, and violent clashes, in which three ethnic Albanians were killed, ensued in Gostivar after government officials forcibly removed Albanian flags from municipal buildings. In September the Mayor of Gostivar, Rufi Osmani, received a custodial sentence of around 13 years, after he was convicted of inciting ethnic tension and rebellion. In April 1998 the Partia Demokratike Shqiptare (PDSh—Democratic Party of Albanians), which had been formed in the previous year by the amalgamation of Xhaferi’s faction and another ethnic Albanian party, withdrew its representatives from all government bodies, in protest against Osmani’s imprisonment.</p>
                         <p>Legislative elections were conducted on 18 October and 1 November 1998, with voting repeated in two electoral districts owing to irregularities. A coalition of the VMRO-DPMNE and the newly formed Demokratska Alternativa (DA—Democratic Alternative), secured a majority in the Assembly, with 59 seats, while the SDSM obtained 29 seats, and an alliance of the PPD and the PDSh 25. Later in November Georgievski was nominated as Prime Minister. A new Government, comprising representatives of the VMRO-DPMNE, the DA and the PDSh (which had been invited to join the coalition), was formed in December. Later that month the Assembly adopted legislation providing for the release of some 8,000 prisoners, including Osmani (who was released in February 1999).</p>
                         <p>On 14 November 1999 Tito Petkovski, representing the SDSM, and Boris Trajkovski, the VMRO-DPMNE candidate, progressed to a second round of presidential voting; a further ballot took place in some western regions on 5 December, following a legal appeal by the SDSM. Trajkovski was elected to the presidency, with 52.9% of the votes cast. A renewed coalition administration was formed on 27 December.</p>
                         <p>In July 2000 Georgievski reorganized the Government. Local elections took place on 10 and 24 September, amid numerous violent incidents; the parties of the governing coalition secured 75 of the 123 municipalities. In November the DA withdrew from the coalition Government and from the Assembly. Georgievski subsequently formed a new administration, which, for the first time, included members of the Liberalno-Demokratska Partija (LDP—Liberal Democratic Party).</p>
                         <p>
            In early 2001 ethnic Albanian militants, members of the self-styled Ushtria Çlirimtare Kombëtare (UÇK—National Liberation Army), began to infiltrate northern parts of the FYRM from Kosovo, clashing with FYRM security forces. In early March UÇK forces seized the border village of Tanusevci, prompting counter-attacks from government troops. The border with Kosovo was closed after senior government officials visiting the border region were attacked. Although the authorities regained control of Tanusevci, UÇK forces attempted to occupy Tetovo. Following an appeal by the Government to the international community for assistance, the 
            <xr pageref="Y" ref="NATO.IO">North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)</xr>
             reinforced its military presence at the Kosovo border. The UÇK declared that the conflict had been initiated to increase pressure on the FYRM Government to institute constitutional guarantees of equal rights for ethnic Albanians. The prolonged bombardment of rebel positions by government forces resulted in a withdrawal by the UÇK from the Tetovo region. At the end of April eight members of the state security forces were killed in a UÇK attack near the Kosovo border. Their funeral precipitated rioting and attacks by Macedonians on Albanian-owned property in the southern town of Bitola. Government troops subsequently launched an offensive against rebel positions near Kumanovo, after two further members of the armed forces were killed.
          </p>
                         <p>After signing a Stabilization and Association Agreement with the EU in April 2001, the Government pledged to initiate wide-ranging reforms. However, it continued to oppose principal de­mands that the Constitution be amended to grant the ethnic Albanian population equal group rights with the Macedonian population, and Albanian the status of a second official language. In early May intensive hostilities resumed in the north of the country. Following EU and NATO mediation, however, it was agreed that the SDSM, the PDSh and the PPD would join a government of national unity; the new administration, headed by Georgievski, was approved by the Assembly on 13 May.</p>

                         <heading>The Ohrid Framework Agreement</heading>
                         <p id="MK.IS.31">On 8 June 2001 Trajkovski announced proposals for a comprehensive peace plan, providing for the proportional representation of ethnic Albanians at all levels of government, the increased official use of the Albanian language, and a partial amnesty for UÇK combatants. However, the UÇK continued to demand that the Government enter into negotiations on constitutional reforms, and rebel forces seized the town of Aracinovo, near Skopje. Later in June the Government suspended its offensive against the UÇK. A ceasefire, signed on 5 July, collapsed after 17 days, when the UÇK launched further attacks on government forces near Tetovo. International diplomatic efforts intensified, and negoti­ations between government and ethnic Albanian representatives, which commenced at the western town of Ohrid at the end of July, resulted in the resolution of the main issues of contention. On 13 August the Government and ethnic Albanian leaders at Ohrid signed a framework peace agreement, providing for the amendment of the Constitution to grant greater rights to the ethnic Albanian community. On the following day the UÇK leader, Ali Ahmeti, agreed that the organization would relinquish its armaments to NATO troops. Meanwhile, investigators from the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) at The Hague, Netherlands, were dispatched to the FYRM to conduct preliminary inquiries into the killing of six ethnic Albanian civilians in the village of Ljuboten in early August. On 22 August a 4,500-member NATO mission, Operation Essential Harvest, was created, with a mandate to disarm the ethnic Albanian combatants. On 26 September the disarmament programme was declared to have been successful, and the establishment of Operation Amber Fox, a NATO mission comprising around 1,000 troops, was authorized, with a three-month renewable mandate. In October Trajkovski approved plans for the deployment of ethnically mixed security units in regions formerly held by the UÇK.</p>
                         <p id="MK.IS.34">On 16 November 2001 the Assembly adopted 15 principal constitutional amendments, which included the introduction in the Assembly of a double majority’ system, whereby certain legislation would require the approval of a minority group, the establishment of Albanian as the second official language in districts in which ethnic Albanians accounted for more than 20% of the population, and the right to proportional representation for ethnic Albanians in the Constitutional Court, all areas of government administration and the security forces. Later in November the SDSM and the LDP withdrew from the coalition Government.</p>
                         <p id="MK.IS.35">In March 2002 the Assembly adopted legislation granting immunity from prosecution to several thousand former UÇK insurgents (excluding those indictable by the ICTY). The Assembly was dissolved on 18 July, prior to legislative elections, which were scheduled for 15 September. In May Ahmeti established a new political party, the Bashkimi Demokratik për Integrim (BDI—Democratic Union for Integration), which was believed to comprise mainly former UÇK combatants. Later that month two ministers belonging to the VMRO-DPMNE resigned from the Government, in protest at perceptions of the growing dominance of former UÇK members within the principal ethnic Albanian parties. At the end of August ethnic Albanians took hostage five civilians at Gostivar; security forces surrounded an ethnic Albanian base and killed two of the kidnappers.</p>
                         <p>None the less, elections to the legislature took place peacefully on 15 September 2002, and were declared by OSCE observers to have been conducted democratically. A 10-party alliance (led by the SDSM and the LDP), Za Makedonija Zaedno (ZMZ—Together for Macedonia), secured 60 of the 120 seats in the Assembly. The VMRO-DPMNE won 33 seats and the BDI 16 seats. The ZMZ alliance and the BDI subsequently signed an agreement for the establishment of a coalition Government (which was, however, to exclude former UÇK combatants). The Assembly approved the new administration, comprising members of the SDSM, the LDP and the BDI, and headed by Crvenkovski, on 1 November. On 14 December Operation Amber Fox was succeeded by a 450-member mission, Allied Harmony. On 31 March 2003 this contingent was, in turn, replaced by an EU-led mission, Operation Concordia, comprising 350 military personnel. In May Nikola Gruevski became leader of the VMRO-DPMNE. Operation Concordia was replaced in December by a 200-member EU mission, Operation Proxima, which received a two-year mandate to maintain security and combat organized crime.</p>
                         <p>On 26 February 2004 President Trajkovski was killed, together with eight government officials, in an airplane crash. At a presidential election, held on 14 April, Crvenkovski, representing the SDSM, won 42.5% of the votes, while Saško Kedev, a VMRO-DPMNE parliamentary deputy, obtained 34.1%. In a second round on 28 April Crvenkovski was elected to the presidency, with 62.7% of the votes; he was inaugurated on 12 May.</p>
                         <p>On 2 June 2004 the Assembly approved the formation of a coalition administration comprising the SDSM, the BDI and the LDP, with Hari Kostov of the SDSM as Prime Minister. The Government had, meanwhile, announced plans to redemarcate municipal boundaries, as part of a process of administrative decentralization included in the provisions of the Ohrid Agreement, despite popular opposition to the proposals. In July, under pressure from the international community, the government parties reached an agreement on the planned redemarcation. The number of administrative districts was to be reduced from 123 to 84, with the ethnic balance of 26 districts becoming predominantly Albanian. On 26 July a large demonstration was staged in Skopje in protest. On 7 November a referendum on the proposed redemarcation was conducted. However, voter par­ticipation was estimated at only 26%, invalidating the results and allowing the reforms to proceed. In mid-November Kostov resigned as Prime Minister, claiming that the BDI had obstructed the parliamentary approval of economic reforms. Later that month Crvenkovski nominated Vlado Buckovski, hitherto Minister of Defence, as Prime Minister. (Buckovski was also elected as Chairman of the SDSM.) On 17 December the Assembly approved a new Government, again comprising members of the SDSM, the LDP and the BDI. In March 2005 the ICTY issued indictments against former Minister of Internal Affairs Ljube Boškoski and a former head of security, Johan Tarculovski, in connection with the August 2001 killings in Ljuboten.</p>

                         <p>Local government elections, which were to effect the significant devolution of powers to new municipal authorities, took place in two rounds on 13 and 27 March 2005. The PDSh and the PPD refused to recognize the results, and an OSCE observer mission upheld claims of irregularities in both rounds. After re-run polls on 10 April, it was announced that 36 of the mayoral contests had been won by the ZMZ coalition, and 15 by the BDI, with the VMRO-DPMNE securing 21 mayoralties. In mid-July, in accordance with the Ohrid Agreement, the Assembly adopted legislation enabling any ethnic minority community to display its flag, together with the state flag, in regions where it constituted at least 50% of the population.</p>
                         <p>In legislative elections, held on 5 July 2006, the VMRO-DPMNE secured 32.5% of the votes cast, defeating the SDSM, which obtained 23.3% of the votes. A coalition of the BDI and the PPD secured 12.2% of the votes, while Xhaferi’s PDSh received 7.2%. After reported electoral irregularities caused voting to be repeated in eight constituencies, the VMRO-DPMNE’s representation in the Assembly increased from 44 to 45 seats. In August Gruevski, the Chairman of the VMRO-DPMNE, was formally appointed as Prime Minister and his new coalition Government, which was dominated by members of the VMRO-DPMNE, was approved by the Assembly. Ljubiša Georgievski was appointed as President of the Assembly.</p>
                         <p>In January 2007 the BDI and the PPD announced a boycott of parliamentary proceedings, in protest against their exclusion from the Government. In February the Assembly approved a government reorganization, which included the appointment of Imer Aliu as Deputy Prime Minister, responsible for the implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement. In May the PPD announced that its representatives were to resume participation in the Assembly, after reaching an agreement with the VMRO-DPMNE permitting it to join the Government. The BDI also ended its boycott of the Assembly, which on 5 June adopted legislation providing for full co-operation with the ICTY.</p>
                         <p>
            Following Greece’s decision to veto NATO membership for the FYRM in April 2008 (see 
            <i>Other External Relations</i>
            ), a motion proposed by the BDI for the dissolution of the Assembly was approved on 12 April. Early legislative elections were scheduled for 1 June. The elections were disrupted by violence between rival ethnic Albanian groups. The OSCE assessed that the elections failed to meet international standards; elections were repeated on 15 June in districts where disorder had prevented voting from taking place, and in a small number of constituencies a further round of voting was conducted on 29 June. According to official results, a 19-party coalition led by the VMRO-DPMNE secured 48.8% of the votes cast and 63 of the 120 seats in the legislature, thereby becoming the first grouping to obtain a majority in the Assembly. An eight-party coalition led by the SDSM was placed second, with 23.7% of the votes, and 27 seats. The BDI received 18 seats (with 12.8%) and the PDSh 11 seats (8.5%). It was subsequently announced that the PPD, which had failed to obtain legislative representation, was to merge with the PDSh. The Assembly approved the formation of a new Government on 26 July, principally comprising members of the VMRO-DPMNE and the BDI. In the same month Boškoski, having been acquitted of all charges at the ICTY, returned to the FYRM. Meanwhile, Tarculovski was sentenced to 12 years’ imprisonment.

            In January 2009 the VMRO-DPMNE selected a non-party member, Gjorge Ivanov, as its candidate to contest the forthcoming presidential election. At the first round on 22 March, Ivanov received 35.1% of the votes cast, while Ljubomir Frčkoski of the SDSM won 20.5%. Ivanov was elected to the presidency at the second round on 5 April, with 63.1% of the votes cast. Voter turnout was 42.6% (after ethnic Albanian voters staged a boycott). At concurrent municipal elections, the coalition led by the VMRO-DPMNE secured 55 mayoralties; the BDI won 14 and the SDSM nine. OSCE and

             observers declared the organization of the elections to have met democratic commitments, but recommended further electoral reforms. Ivanov was inaugurated as President on 12 May. In the same month Crvenkovski was elected as Chairman of the SDSM (a position he had held in 1991-2004).

                         <p>In December 2010 the owner of major independent television channel A1&#160;TV and 16 executives from associated companies were arrested on corruption charges. In January 2011 employees of A1&#160;TV broadcast news bulletins from locations outside government offices in Skopje, in protest at the freezing of the station’s bank accounts by the authorities, claiming that the corruption investigation was politically motivated. The SDSM, followed by the LDP and other allied parties, began a boycott of the Assembly in support of A1&#160;TV. However, in February a court in Skopje ruled in favour of reimposing a freeze on the bank accounts of A1&#160;TV, which ceased operations in mid-2011.</p>

                         <p>Gruevski proposed on 30 March 2011 that early legislative elections be scheduled for June, having secured agreement from Crvenkovski that the SDSM would participate in the polls. The Assembly subsequently approved amendments to the electoral code, and a motion dissolving the legislature was unanimously adopted on 14 April.</p>
                         <p>At the pre-term parliamentary elections on 5 June 2011, the coalition of parties led by the VMRO-DPMNE won 39.0% of the votes cast, obtaining 56 seats in the Assembly (thereby losing its majority). The SDSM-led opposition coalition strengthened its position, receiving 32.8% of the votes cast and 42 seats; the BDI obtained 10.2% of the votes and 15 seats, and the PDSh 5.9% and eight seats. Under the earlier electoral amendments, the Assembly had been expanded to 123 deputies, with the additional three seats allocated to representatives of citizens resident abroad. On 29 July the Assembly approved the formation of a new coalition Government led by the VMRO-DPMNE, again under the premiership of Gruevski. Representatives of the BDI received significant portfolios, including Teuta Arifi, who was appointed as Deputy Prime Minister, responsible for European Integration, and Fatmir Besimi, as Minister of Defence.</p>
                         <p>An incident in February 2012, in which a police officer had killed two ethnic Albanians in Gostivar, precipitated a series of attacks by ethnic Albanian youths against Macedonians in early March. In April five Macedonians were found killed at the village of Smilkovci, near Skopje, precipitating protests directed against the ethnic Albanian community in Skopje and elsewhere.</p>
                         <p>A new lustration law, intended to remove former secret police informants of the communist era from certain professions, was adopted in July 2012. In February 2013 several BDI members of government were replaced, following the resignation of officials to contest local elections; these included Arifi, who was succeeded as Deputy Prime Minister, responsible for European Integration, by Besimi. However, the appointment of a former commander of the UÇK militia, Talat Xhaferi, to replace Besimi as Minister of Defence prompted ethnic Macedonian protests; counter-demonstrations by ethnic Albanians degenerated into violent clashes at the beginning of March. After EU mediation, on 1 March it was announced that the SDSM had agreed to end a parliamentary boycott and to participate in the local elections. The first round of the local elections (at which the number of municipalities was reduced from 84 to 80) took place on 23 March, followed by a second round on 7 April. A coalition led by the VMRO-DPMNE secured control of 58 mayoralties. Although the OSCE generally endorsed the conduct of the elections, observers confirmed opposition allegations of voter intimidation and other irregularities.</p>
                         <p>On 2 June 2013 Zoran Zaev, the Mayor of the south-eastern town of Strumica, was elected as the new Chairman of the SDSM, replacing Crvenkovski, who had announced following the local polls that he would not seek re-election to the post. In July Boškoski (who had already received a five-year prison sentence for illegal financing of his party in the 2011 parliamentary elections) was sentenced to a further 12 years’ imprisonment, after being convicted of involvement in the killing of two members of a criminal network in 2001.</p>
                         <p>In February 2014 the first round of a presidential election was scheduled for 13 April. The BDI opposed Ivanov’s candidacy for re-election and urged its supporters to boycott the poll. A parliamentary motion by the BDI in favour of further pre-term legislative elections was adopted, and the Assembly was dissolved on 5 March; it was announced that the elections would take place on 27 April, concurrently with a possible second presidential round. At the first round of the presidential election on 13 April, Ivanov secured 51.7% of the votes cast, followed by Stevo Pendarovski of the SDSM, with 37.5%; a voter turnout of 48.8% was recorded. The SDSM accused the ruling party of electoral malpractice. In the second round of presidential voting on 27 April, Ivanov was re-elected to the presidency, defeating Pendarovski, with 55.3% of the votes. In the concurrent elections to the Assembly, the alliance led by the VMRO-DPMNE increased its representation to 61 seats (one short of a majority), with 43.0% of the votes cast, while the alliance led by the SDSM lost support, obtaining 34 seats and 25.3% of the votes cast. The BDI won 13.7% and 19 seats, followed by the PDSh, with 5.9% and seven seats.</p>
                         <p>On 12 May 2014 Ivanov was inaugurated for a second presidential term. On 19 June Gruevski’s new coalition Government, again principally comprising the VMRO-DPMNE and BDI members, was approved by the Assembly, despite a boycott of the new legislature by SDSM deputies. At the end of that month six ethnic Albanians belonging to an extremist Islamist group received sentences of life imprisonment in connection with the killing of the five Macedonians in April 2012. The verdict prompted protests, which escalated into rioting in Skopje. (In December 2017 the Supreme Court ordered a retrial, which began in May 2018.)</p>

                         <heading>Political Crisis and Agreement</heading>
                         <p>Following increasing antagonism between Gruevski and SDSM leader Zaev, who claimed to be in possession of information highly incriminating to the Government, at the end of January 2015 Zaev was charged with attempted blackmail and violence against state officials. Shortly afterwards, the SDSM presented allegations that more than 20,000 people, including opposition leaders, political activists, journalists, members of the judiciary and other prominent figures, had been subjected to illegal surveillance ordered by Gruevski and the head of the intelligence agency (and Gruevski’s cousin), Sašo Mijalkov; recordings were released to support the claims, which Gruevski denied. During early 2015 Zaev continued to release recordings of what were alleged to be conversations between senior government officials, including Gruevski, Mijalkov and Minister of Internal Affairs Gordana Jankuloska, appearing to contain evidence of direct government involvement in electoral malpractice, manipulation of the media and abuse of the judicial system. On 12 May Mijalkov resigned, together with Jankuloska and the Minister of Transport and Communications. Nevertheless, large anti-Government demonstrations took place a few days later in Skopje.</p>
                         <p>EU-mediated discussions between Gruevski and opposition leaders resulted in a provisional agreement on 2 June 2015 that early elections would be organized. Further demonstrations took place in Skopje later in June to demand Gruevski’s resignation. On 15 July agreement was reached between government and opposition representatives, under which the SDSM agreed to end its boycott of the Assembly by the beginning of September. The Government was to resign by mid-January 2016, to allow the creation of an interim Government, headed by a Prime Minister nominated by the VMRO-DPMNE, and legislative elections were to be scheduled for 24 April. In accordance with EU recommendations, in July 2015 the Assembly also voted to repeal the controversial lustration law.</p>
                         <p>Gruevski announced his resignation as Prime Minister on 15 January 2016. On 18 January the ruling coalition in the Assembly voted to dissolve the legislature on 24 February, prior to elections on 24 April, and to form an interim coalition Government headed by Emil Dimitriev, the Secretary-General of the VMRO-DPMNE. However, after a joint EU-US assessment stating that preparations were not adequate for the conduct of democratic elections in the country (upholding complaints by the SDSM), on 24 February the Assembly postponed its dissolution to 7 April and that of the legislative elections to 5 June. Further anti-Government protests were staged at the Constitutional Court, which on 16 March approved the annulment of a legal provision preventing the President from granting pardons for serious crimes. On 12 April President Ivanov controversially announced that criminal investigations into more than 50 politicians (mainly from the VMRO-DPMNE) and their associates were to be halted. A series of demonstrations subsequently commenced to demand the resignation of Ivanov and the postponement of the legislative elections.</p>

                         <p>Following a ruling by the Constitutional Court upholding a BDI challenge that the dissolution of the Assembly had been in breach of the Constitution, on 18 May 2016 the Assembly was reconvened and agreed to postpone the June legislative elections. On the same day the Assembly voted to remove SDSM representatives in the Government who had been appointed under the June 2015 agreement, including Minister of Internal Affairs Oliver Spasovski and Minister of Labour and Social Policy Frosina Tasevska-Remenski; they were to be replaced with VMRO-DPMNE members. On 6 June Ivanov announced his decision to revoke the pardons issued in April. On 20 July the VMRO-DPMNE, the SDSM, the BDI and the PDSh reached a new agreement, with mediation by the EU and the USA, under which the electoral code, voter register and media legislation were to be revised by the end of August. On 31 August it was further agreed that early parliamentary elections would be conducted on 11 December. A new interim Government (in which Spasovski and Tasevska-Remenski were reinstated) was formed on 2 September for the duration of the electoral period. The Assembly was dissolved on 17 October, prior to the elections.</p>
                         <p>
            The outcome of the legislative elections on 11 December 2016 failed to resolve the conflict between the main parties: the VMRO-DPMNE was narrowly first placed, with 38.1% of the votes cast and 51 seats, followed by the SDSM, with 36.7% and 49 seats; the BDI received 7.3% of the votes and 10 seats. After the SDSM and the ethnic Albanian Lëvizja Besa (BESA—Besa Movement) submitted complaints of voting irregularities to the State Election Commission, thousands of VMRO-DPMNE supporters gathered outside the Commission’s offices in mid-December. 
            <!--http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/macedonia-s-gruevski-gives-threatening-speech-12-17-2016-->
            Gruevski subsequently denounced the Commission for upholding only one of a total of 15 electoral complaints. Polls were repeated on 25 December in the north-western municipalities of Tearce and Gostivar. On 29 December the SDSM members in the interim Government were replaced, Agim Nuhiu becoming the first ethnic Albanian Minister of Internal Affairs.
          </p>
                         <p>On 9 January 2017 President Ivanov presented Gruevski with a mandate to form a new government; however, coalition negotiations between the VMRO-DPMNE and the BDI failed. Meanwhile, on 18 January the Special Prosecutor announced the withdrawal of all charges that had been brought against Zaev in January 2015. On 27 February 2017 Zaev claimed a new mandate, after the BDI, the Lëvizja për Reforma-Partia Demokratike Shqiptare (LR-PDSh, Movement for Reform-Democratic Party of Albanians) and BESA indicated that they would grant the SDSM parliamentary majority support, in exchange for agreement to their demands, which included the adoption of a new language law extending the use of Albanian as a second official language. Gruevski criticized the agreement as unconstitutional, and protests led by the VMRO-DPMNE erupted in Skopje and other towns. Despite international pressure, Ivanov refused to grant Zaev a mandate. After the Assembly was reconvened on 27 March, the SDSM, with the support of a number of ethnic Albanian parties, proposed Talat Xhaferi of the BDI as the new speaker; however, the VMRO-DPMNE deputies sought to prevent a vote approving his nomination.</p>
                         <p>On 27 April 2017 the SDSM-led majority in the Assembly finally elected Xhaferi as its President, precipitating violent protests by VMRO-DPMNE supporters; later that day around 200 protesters succeeded in gaining access to the parliamentary chamber and assaulted SDSM deputies, including Zaev. The chamber was besieged for several hours, until riot police expelled the protesters. More than 100 people were reported to have required hospital treatment. BDI Minister of Internal Affairs Agim Nuhiu criticized the police for failing to prevent the violence and announced the dismissal of the head of the Public Safety Bureau (the police department in charge of emergency situations), Mitko Chavkov.</p>

                         <p>On 17 May 2017, following continued international pressure, Ivanov awarded Zaev the mandate to form a government. At the end of May a new Government led by Zaev, comprising 17 representatives nominated by the SDSM-led alliance, and including six members of the BDI, was approved by 62 deputies in the 120-seat Assembly. Radmila Šekerinska Jankovska of the SDSM was appointed Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence, Spasovski was retained as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Internal Affairs, and Nikola Dimitrov, a former ambassador to the USA, became Minister of Foreign Affairs. In June the Special Prosecutor announced the indictment of Gruevski in relation to a number of charges resulting from the released illicit recordings. Local elections took place on 15 and 29 October, in which the SDSM performed strongly. On 11 December Gruevski tendered his resignation as President of the VMRO-DPMNE, and his trial began later that month. Hristijan Mickoski, previously the head of the state electricity company, was elected as his party successor on 23 December.</p>
                         <p>On 14 March 2018 the ruling majority in the Assembly for the second time adopted legislation, which had been vetoed by President Ivanov in January, extending the use of Albanian as an official language nationwide. VMRO-DPMNE deputies, who had strongly opposed the legislation, claiming that it was unconstitutional, disrupted the session. Opposition deputies proposed a no confidence motion against the Government in April, which was, however, defeated. BESA joined the Government as part of a reorganization implemented at the beginning of June. The new language law was promulgated in January 2019, although the Venice Commission subsequently presented objections to a number of its provisions.</p>
                         <p>Meanwhile, on 21 May 2018 Zaev was acquitted by the Skopje Criminal Court of charges of soliciting a bribe from a local businessman while Mayor of Strumica in 2013. Gruevski was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment on 23 May 2018, for abuse of office in the public procurement of a luxury vehicle. However, in November, after Gruevski’s appeal for a postponement of his sentence was rejected, he fled to Hungary where the Government of Viktor Orbán granted him political asylum.</p>

                         <p>
            The signature on 17 June 2018 of the Prespa Agreement, under which the country would be renamed the Republic of North Macedonia (see 
            <i>Regional Relations</i>
            ), precipitated large demonstrations in Skopje. On 20 June the Assembly ratified the agreement on the constitutional renaming of the FYRM, with VMRO-DPMNE deputies boycotting the session. Although President Ivanov refused to endorse the accord, on 5 July the Assembly approved it for a second time, overriding the presidential veto, and a national referendum on its adoption was scheduled for September. The VMRO-DPMNE refused to participate in the campaign for the referendum, while prominent members, including Ivanov, urged a boycott. At the non-binding referendum on 30 September, 94.2% of those participating voted `in favour of EU and NATO membership by accepting the agreement’, although the turnout of 36.9% fell below the 50% required to validate the result. On 19 October 80 of the 120 deputies in the Assembly voted to rename the country, thereby narrowly securing the two-thirds’ majority required to amend the Constitution. Later that month the VMRO-DPMNE expelled several prominent members who had supported the agreement; in late November it launched a further series of protests in Skopje to demand the resignation of the Government. The Assembly approved a draft constitutional amendment providing for the name change on 2 December. Later that month the Assembly approved legislation, initiated by eight opposition deputies who had provided pivotal support for the Prespa Agreement, allowing an amnesty for some participants in the April 2017 attack in the parliamentary chamber.
          </p>
                         <p>In a final parliamentary vote on 11 January 2019, amid protests outside the Assembly building, four constitutional amendments to rename the country the Republic of North Macedonia were adopted by 81 deputies. On 12 February the Prespa Agreement with Greece entered into force, allowing the FYRM to be renamed as the Republic of North Macedonia, and on the following day the UN was officially informed by the Macedonian Government of the new name.</p>
                         <p>In March 2019 the Criminal Court in Skopje convicted 16 people accused of involvement in the April 2017 parliamentary violence; Chavkov was sentenced to 18 years’ imprisonment on charges of `terrorist endangerment’, while 14 other defendants received terms ranging from seven to 15 years in prison and one was acquitted. Fifteen others, including five VMRO-DPMNE deputies, had been pardoned under the amnesty law of December 2018.</p>
                         <p>The first round of a presidential election took place on 21 April 2019, when the SDSM candidate, Stevo Pendarovski, secured 42.8% of the votes, narrowly ahead of Gordana Siljanovska Davkova of the VMRO-DPMNE, with 42.3%; the other candidate, Blerim Reka (an independent representing the Albanian minority), received 10.6%. At a second round of voting on 5 May, Pendarovski secured victory with 51.7% of the votes cast. The participation rate was 41.7% in the first round, increasing to 46.7% in the second. Pendarovski was inaugurated on 12 May. On 28 June the Assembly approved a government reorganization, as part of which Zaev assumed temporary responsibility for the finance portfolio. Following VMRO-DPMNE criticism, however, Nina Angelovska, an independent, was appointed as the new Minister of Finance at the end of August.</p>

                         <p>
            Following continued delay in the opening of EU accession negotiations with North Macedonia (see 
            <i>Other External Relations</i>
            ), on 20 October 2019 the leaders of the main political parties agreed that early legislative elections would be scheduled for 12 April 2020. Zaev was to resign in January (in accordance with the 2015 political agreement) to allow the establishment of an interim `technical’ Government prior to the elections.
          </p>
                         <p>On 3 January 2020 Zaev accordingly resigned and an interim coalition Government, headed by Spasovski of the SDSM, was approved. However, on 15 February the Assembly approved the dismissal of VMRO-DPMNE representative Rašela Mizrahi as Minister of Labour and Social Policy, after she appeared at a press conference in front of a placard bearing the country’s former constitutional name, the Republic of Macedonia. Amid tensions within the ruling coalition, on the following day the SDSM narrowly secured parliamentary approval of a long-delayed prosecution law supported by the EU and the USA, by the required minimum of 80 votes cast. The Assembly was dissolved immediately afterwards, prior to the early elections.</p>
                         <p>In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, on 17 March 2020 political leaders agreed to postpone the early elections in April, with the interim Government remaining in place. On the following day President Pendarovski declared a 30-day nationwide state of emergency. The national state of emergency was progressively extended until 12 June, and in mid-June Zaev announced that the delayed elections would take place on 15 July.</p>
                         <p>An SDSM-led coalition, Možemo (We Can), was narrowly first-placed at the legislative elections on 15 July 2020, securing 35.9% of the votes cast and 46 seats, followed by the Obnova (Renewal) alliance, led by the VMRO-DPMNE, which obtained 34.6% of the votes and 44 seats. The principal ethnic Albanian parties performed strongly, with the BDI securing 11.5% of the votes and 15 seats, while the Aleanca për Shqiptarët (ASh—Alliance for Albanians—previously the LR-PDSh) won 9.0% and 12 seats. Owing to the pandemic, a reduced rate of voter participation, of 52.0%, was recorded.</p>
                         <p>On 18 August 2020 the SDSM and the BDI reached a power-sharing agreement, enabling them to form a coalition with a narrow parliamentary majority. Under the agreement Zaev was to remain premier until 100 days before the next parliamentary elections, when the BDI would propose an ethnic Albanian candidate for Prime Minister, who would serve until the elections. In accordance with the agreement, on 21 August Xhaferi was re-elected as President of the Assembly. On 30 August a new coalition Government, comprising representatives of the SDSM, the BDI and affiliated parties, was approved by 62 votes in the Assembly. Several former SDSM ministers were reappointed, while new BDI representatives included Artan Grubi as First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Political System and Inter-Community Relations. Following a resurgence in cases of COVID-19, on 20 November the Government declared a new nationwide state of crisis, which was subsequently extended by the Assembly until the end of June 2021.</p>
                         <p>
            Meanwhile, the retrial of the six ethnic Albanians accused of the murders of five ethnic Macedonians in April 2012 concluded on 23 February 2021. Three of the defendants (two of whom were sentenced 
            <i>in absentia</i>
            ) again received life sentences, while two received reduced sentences of 15 and nine years in prison, respectively, and the other was acquitted. Shortly afterwards, supporters of the defendants staged a protest in Skopje against their convictions and denouncing the judiciary, which escalated into violent confrontations with armed police. Meanwhile, also on 26 February former head of the intelligence agency Mijalkov was sentenced to 12 years’ imprisonment for organizing large-scale illegal surveillance activities during 2008-15; several other former senior officials were convicted on associated charges, including Minister of Internal Affairs Jankuloska, who received a four-year term. Mijalkov received an additional eight-year sentence in April 2021 for abuse of office; two other defendants received prison terms of 15 years and five years, respectively. In July former parliamentary speaker Trajko Veljanoski, two former ministers and a former head of secret police were sentenced to eight years in prison on charges of organizing the April 2017 violence.

            (However, in late 2022 the Skopje Court of Appeal overturned the 2021 convictions and prison sentences imposed against Mijalkov and his former associates, citing procedural irregularities, and ordered a retrial.)

            Public dissatisfaction at the Government’s management of the COVID-19 crisis increased in September 2021, when a fire at a temporary COVID-19 hospital in Tetovo killed 16 people. OSCE-monitored local elections were conducted on 17 October, with a second round on 31 October. VMRO-DPMNE candidates or candidates supported by the party won 42 of the mayoral posts in the 80 municipalities (compared with five in the previous 2017 elections), while the SDSM retained only 16 (from 57 previously). Significantly, in Skopje the incumbent SDSM Mayor, Petre Šilegov, was defeated by an independent candidate supported by the VMRO-DPMNE, Danela Arsovska. The official voter turnout was 49% in the first round and 44% in the second round of elections. In response to the defeat, Zaev announced his resignation as both leader of the SDSM and Prime Minister late on 31 October (while rejecting VMRO-DPMNE demands for early elections). However, he postponed his formal resignation, after BESA defected from the ruling coalition and supported an opposition initiative to bring a parliamentary motion of no confidence against the Government (which narrowly failed on 11 November).

                         <p>Zaev in early December 2021 negotiated an agreement with a small ethnic Albanian party, Alternativa (Alternative), to join a SDSM-led coalition, which thereby secured a narrow majority. On 12 December the SDSM elected Zaev’s favoured candidate, Deputy Minister of Finance Dimitar Kovačevski, to succeed him as leader of the party. After Zaev’s resignation was ratified by the Assembly, President Pendarovski nominated Kovačevski as Prime Minister on 29 December. Kovačevski’s Government, comprising members of the SDSM, the BDI and Alternativa, was approved by 62 votes in the Assembly on 16 January 2022. Eight members of the previous administration were replaced, including Radmila Šekerinska Jankovska, who was succeeded as Minister of Defence by Slavjanka Petrovska (also of the SDSM).</p>

            On 21 April 2022 the Skopje Criminal Court sentenced Gruevski 
            <i>in absentia</i>
             to a seven-year prison term (later increased to nine years by the Court of Appeal) on charges of embezzling VMRO-DPMNE party funds, money laundering and the illegal acquisition of property; four associates were also convicted, including Mijalkov, who received a 15-month sentence. Gruevski received further prison sentences 
            <i>in absentia</i>
             of nine years in May for ordering the demolition of a building owned by a political rival in Skopje, and of six years in early June over the financing of the construction of party headquarters in the capital.

            A compromise agreement reached with Bulgaria in an effort to secure the opening of EU accession negotiations, under which the Constitution would be amended to recognize the existence of an ethnic Bulgarian minority (see 
            <i>Other External Relations</i>
            ), precipitated violent protests in Skopje by supporters of the VMRO-DPMNE from early July 2022. Following lengthy debate, on 16 July the agreement was approved by 68 votes cast in the Assembly. However, amid continued popular opposition, the Government lacked the two thirds’ majority to change the Constitution as required.
          </p>
                         <p>In early February 2023 the ASh, now headed by Arben Taravari, announced its decision to join the ruling coalition, thereby increasing its parliamentary majority. However, after three deputies from rival ethnic Albanian party Alternativa and another from a smaller party consequently withdrew from the coalition, the government majority was increased only to 68 seats. In mid-February the Ministers of Justice and of the Environment and Physical Planning tendered their resignations; however, the three incumbent ministers from Alternativa refused to resign and, after delays due to VMRO-DPMNE dissent, were dismissed by parliamentary votes. On 27 February three representatives of the ASh were appointed to the Government, including Krenar Loga, who was awarded the justice portfolio.</p>

            On 6 September 2023 the Assembly approved amendments to the criminal code providing for a significant reduction in the maximum legal penalties for abuse of office and associated crimes, such as the misappropriation of public funds; the changes, which were adopted through an expedited parliamentary procedure and implemented a few days later, were opposed by ethnic Albanian political groups, and attracted strong criticism from the EU and the USA. In October the Skopje Criminal Court granted a request by the Public Prosecutor’s Office to discontinue legal proceedings against Mijalkov and other former officials related to the illegal surveillance case, due to expiry of the statute of limitations under the recent changes to the criminal code (which affected a number of ongoing major corruption cases). In December the Supreme Court rejected an appeal by Gruevski for reconsideration of the nine-year sentence against him for embezzlement, although other pending cases against him were also abandoned due to the statute of limitations.

                         <p>
            Following prolonged disagreement, in early December 2023 the leaders of the main political parties agreed to schedule the first round of a presidential election for 24 April 2024, with the second round to take place concurrently with parliamentary elections on 8 May. An interim `technical’ government was to be formed, which would include opposition members and, under the 2020 power-sharing agreement between the SDSM and the BDI, would for the first time be headed by an ethnic Albanian premier. Accordingly, on 25 January 2024 Kovačevski announced the resignation of his Government. The BDI nominated the hitherto parliamentary speaker, Xhaferi of the BDI, as the new Prime Minister, and an interim Government under Xhaferi’s leadership was approved by the Assembly on 28 January, with 65 votes in favour; the VMRO-DPMNE, which had opposed Xhaferi’s candidacy, boycotted the vote. The Government was to hold office for a period of 100 days prior to the legislative elections. In early February a dispute erupted within the ASh, after its leader, Taravari, announced that the party had decided to join the ethnic Albanian opposition European Union for Change alliance, later known as Vlen
            
             (Worth—which included parliamentary parties Alternativa and BESA), prior to the elections. Later that month the Assembly approved legislative amendments ending a 2018 ban on state-funded advertising in private media; the principal journalists’ associations issued a joint statement condemning the measure.

                         <p>In the legislative elections on 8 May 2024 the VMRO-DPMNE and allied parties in the Tvoja Makedonija (Your Macedonia) alliance secured 58 of the 120 seats in the Assembly, with 43.2% of the votes cast; the SDSM-led alliance Za Evropska Idnina (For a European Future) secured just 15.4% of the votes, winning 18 seats. Gordana Siljanovska Davkova of the VMRO-DPMNE was elected as North Macedonia’s first female President in a concurrent second round of voting, in which she secured 65.1% of the total votes, defeating the incumbent, Pendarovski. She was inaugurated on 12 May.</p>

            Following the September 1995 interim agreement with Greece, the FYRM was admitted to the Council of Europe later that month, and to the OSCE in October; in the following month the FYRM joined NATO’s Partnership for Peace’ programme. The agreement with Greece facilitated the establishment of full diplomatic relations with the EU in January 1996. By 1999 relations with Greece had improved significantly, and the principal border crossing with Greece was reopened in 2000, while the construction of a pipeline to transport petroleum from the capital, Skopje, to Thessaloniki, Greece, was completed in 2002. The announcement in 2006 that the international airport near Skopje was to be renamed after Alexander the Great (considered by Greece to be integral to its cultural heritage) provoked renewed tension. In October 2007 Greece announced that it would veto the FYRM’s NATO and EU applications if no resolution was reached on the ongoing dispute over the country’s permanent name. After failing to receive an invitation to join NATO in April 2008 (see 
            <i>Other External Relations</i>
            ), in November the FYRM submitted a legal challenge against Greece at the 
            <xr pageref="Y" ref="IO-UN.527">International Court of Justice (ICJ)</xr>
            , claiming that it had violated the terms of the interim accord of 1995, which stipulated that Greece would not veto the country’s accession to international institutions under its provisional name. On 5 December 2011 the ICJ ruled that Greece had contravened the interim accord by vetoing the country’s application to join NATO in 2008. 
          </p>
                         <p>After the new Greek Government of Alexis Tsipras initiated discussions on confidence-building measures, in June 2015 Greece’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nikos Kotzias visited Skopje; his FYRM counterpart made a reciprocal visit to the Greek capital, Athens, in December (the first such visit in 15 years). During another visit by Kotzias to Skopje in August 2017, he and the FYRM Minister of Foreign Affairs, Nikola Dimitrov, pledged to resume efforts to resolve the name dispute. Accordingly, further negotiations were convened in December in Brussels, Belgium, under the continued mediation of UN envoy Matthew Nimetz. Zaev and Tsipras, meeting on the occasion of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on 24 January 2018, agreed reciprocal concessions; the FYRM Government was to rename the Alexander the Great airport Skopje International, while Greece was to support the FYRM’s closer integration with the EU. However, from early 2018 large-scale demonstrations were staged in Greece against a compromise with the FYRM in the name dispute, while in March nationalist protesters in Skopje demanded that the UN recognize the country under its constitutional name.</p>
                         <p>
            On 17 June 2018 Zaev and Tsipras, meeting at Lake Prespa, bordering both of their states, signed an accord (the Prespa Agreement) providing for the eventual renaming of the FYRM as the Republic of North Macedonia, and under which Greece would end its opposition to the country’s applications for membership of the EU and NATO (see 
            <i>Other External Relations</i>
            ). In addition, the Vergina emblem was to be removed from public use in the FYRM and a committee was to be created for the review of school textbooks and maps in both countries. Direct commercial flights between Greece and the FYRM resumed in November, following a suspension of 12 years. After parliamentary approval of the agreement proceeded in both countries (see 
            <i>Domestic Political Affairs</i>
            ), on 8 February 2019 Greece became the first NATO member state to ratify an accession protocol, signed by the Macedonian Government two days earlier, thereby allowing the name change to proceed officially on 12 February. Tsipras made an official visit to Skopje in April, during which he and Zaev signed a memorandum of understanding on the construction of new road and rail links between Thessaloniki and North Macedonia; an intergovernmental co-operation council was also created.

                         <p id="MK.IS.41">Kosovo’s declaration of independence on 17 February 2008 was celebrated by ethnic Albanians in Skopje. In October the FYRM Government extended diplomatic recognition to Kosovo, prompting an official protest from Serbia. Diplomatic relations with Kosovo were formally established in October 2009, following the ratification of an agreement on the demarcation of the common border by the legislatures of both countries.</p>
                         <p>The FYRM’s relations with Serbia also progressively improved: in March 2013 their Governments signed an agreement providing for improved bilateral relations and co-operation in the EU integration processes of both states. During a visit to Skopje by Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vučić in February 2015, seven co-operation accords were signed. However, following increasing tensions between the Serbian Government and the new Government of Zaev, in August 2017 Serbia briefly recalled its diplomatic staff from the FYRM, following Macedonian support for Kosovo’s application to join UNESCO. After Zaev and Vučić (who had been elected to the Serbian presidency) agreed to resolve bilateral disagreements through dialogue, they met in the Serbian capital, Belgrade, in late November. Nevertheless, on 12 December Zaev became the first premier of the FYRM to visit Kosovo, where he pledged support for Kosovo’s membership of UNESCO. Following an initiative by Vučić, on 10 October 2019 he, Zaev, and the Albanian Prime Minister, Edi Rama, meeting in the Serbian city of Novi Sad, signed a declaration of intent to establish a free movement zone between their respective states. In December 2021 Rama, Vučić and Zaev signed several agreements in the Albanian capital, Tirana, on the movement of goods, service and workers under the `Open Balkan’ initiative. Further co-operation was agreed at Open Balkan summits in Ohrid in June 2022 and in Belgrade in September. However, in July 2023 Rama reportedly announced that the initiative had fulfilled its mission (indicating an intention to focus on Albania’s EU membership application). Nevertheless, on 22 January 2024 representatives of North Macedonia, Serbia and Albania signed two protocols for the establishment of a free labour market between the three countries under the Open Balkan initiative, with effect from 1 March.</p>

                         <p>The Government signed a Stabilization and Association Agreement with the EU in 2001, which came into effect in April 2004. A formal application for membership of the EU was submitted in March 2004, and the FYRM was awarded candidate status in December 2005. In October 2007 NATO member states adopted a resolution supporting the FYRM’s accession application. However, owing to the unresolved dispute over the country’s permanent name, Greece vetoed the application at a NATO summit meeting in April 2008. In November 2009 the European Commission announced the removal of visa requirements for citizens of the FYRM visiting the countries of the Schengen zone. Although in October the European Commission recommended opening accession negotiations, no start date was agreed, owing to the objections of Greece. Despite the impasse, in March 2012 the country began a preliminary High-Level Accession Dialogue with the European Commission. At a meeting of the European Council in December, Bulgaria joined Greece in opposing the opening of negotiations (following concerns at perceived discrimination against ethnic Bulgarians in the country). In January 2013, however, discussions began on the signature of a friendship treaty between the two states. The treaty, affirming Bulgarian support for the FYRM’s applications to join NATO and the EU, was signed by Zaev and his Bulgarian counterpart in Skopje in August 2017.</p>
                         <p>
            Following the signature of the Prespa Agreement providing for a resolution to the name dispute with Greece (see 
            <i>Regional Relations</i>
            ), on 26 June 2018 the EU General Affairs Council issued a statement envisaging the opening of accession negotiations with the FYRM and Albania. On 11-12 July 2018, at a NATO summit meeting held in Brussels, the FYRM received a formal invitation to join the Alliance and membership talks were initiated. The foreign ministers of NATO member states and the `future Republic of North Macedonia’ signed a protocol on the country’s accession in Brussels on 6 February 2019, which was ratified by Greece shortly afterwards. In May Pope Francis made a historic visit to North Macedonia. Nevertheless, at a summit in June, and again in October, EU ministers of foreign affairs postponed a final decision on the opening of accession negotiations with North Macedonia (and Albania), primarily due to objections from French President Emmanuel Macron. Zaev denounced the delay (which prompted the scheduling of early legislative elections—see 
            <i>Domestic Political Affairs</i>
            ). On 2 March 2020 the European Commission released favourable progress reports on both countries, and renewed its recommendations for the opening of accession negotiations; North Macedonia was considered to have made significant progress in strengthening the independence of the judiciary (following the adoption of a new prosecution law in mid-February). On 24 March the Council of the EU agreed to open accession negotiations with both countries. Meanwhile, on 11 February North Macedonia’s Assembly ratified the NATO accession protocol, and the country was officially admitted to the Alliance on 27 March. However, in November the Council of the EU failed to approve a negotiating framework for North Macedonia, owing to a veto introduced by Bulgaria, which reportedly sought guarantees that North Macedonia would meet its commitments under the 2017 friendship treaty, in addition to the avoidance of reference to the `Macedonian language’ in EU documents.

                         <p>
            After a new Bulgarian Government declared its intention to resume negotiations on the issues of contention, its Prime Minister, Kiril Petkov, headed an official delegation to North Macedonia on 18 January 2022. The Bulgarian legislature voted in June to end the country’s veto on North Macedonia’s EU membership talks, and in early July the Macedonian Government accepted in principle a French-mediated compromise resolution to the dispute with Bulgaria, under which the existence of an ethnic Bulgarian minority would be recognized in North Macedonia’s Constitution. Following approval of the agreement by the Assembly, EU accession negotiations were officially launched on 19 July. However, progress was delayed by the inability of the Government to secure approval of the necessary constitutional changes (see 
            <i>Domestic Political Affairs</i>
            ). Tensions involving the ethnic Bulgarian community in North Macedonia increased in early 2023. On 2 February the Bulgarian legislature adopted a declaration condemning an alleged `anti-Bulgarian campaign’ in North Macedonia, in particular an attack in January on the secretary of a newly opened Bulgarian cultural club (named after Bulgaria’s Second World War ruler Tsar Boris III) in Ohrid, which had prompted the temporary recall of the Bulgarian ambassador in Skopje. Controversy also surrounded a church ceremony on 4 February commemorating the birthdate of Ottoman-era independence fighter Goce Delčev, whose legacy was claimed by both countries, after groups of Bulgarian citizens announced that they would travel to Skopje for the occasion. Special police forces guarded the church in Skopje, and three Bulgarian citizens were detained at the border for disturbing public order. Despite inter-party negotiations, the VMRO-DPMNE continued to prevent adoption of the constitutional changes, citing a lack of guarantees that Bulgaria would not obstruct North Macedonia’s EU accession process in the future. In its annual report issued in November, the European Commission referred to progress in some areas, but in particular criticized deepening political polarization, which had delayed the adoption of reforms, and the implications of the recent changes to the criminal code (see 
            <i>Recent Developments: Electoral Preparations</i>
            ) in halting or ending a number of high-level corruption cases.

            Following the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, the Assembly adopted an eight-point declaration supporting the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine (with 116 deputies voting in favour). The Government joined the wide-ranging sanctions imposed by the EU against Russia and announced the donation of military material and equipment to Ukraine. In March the Government of North Macedonia declared five Russian diplomats 
            <i>personae non gratae</i>
             for violating diplomatic norms, followed by a further six Russian diplomats in mid-April. However, at the end of November 2023 Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov visited Skopje to attend an OSCE ministerial summit, after North Macedonia (which held the OSCE presidency) temporarily lifted an EU ban on Russian flights; several OSCE member states, including Ukraine, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, boycotted the event in protest at Lavrov’s participation. Meanwhile, in November Minister of Defence Slavjanka Petrovska announced that the training of a first group of Ukrainian soldiers had been completed at North Macedonian army facilities, with training efforts to continue.

               <p id="MK.IS.55">In 2022 the country recorded a visible merchandise trade deficit of US&#160;$3,667.7m., and there was a deficit of $864.8m. on the current account of the balance of payments. In 2022 the principal source of imports was the United Kingdom (accounting for 15.8% of total imports, according to preliminary figures); other major sources were Greece, Germany, the People’s Republic of China, Türkiye, Serbia and Bulgaria. Germany was the principal market for exports in that year (accounting for 45.1% of exports, according to preliminary data). The main imports in 2022 were basic manufactures, machinery and transport equipment, mineral fuels and lubricants, chemical products, food and live animals, and miscellaneous manufactured articles.

               <p id="MK.IS.56">North Macedonia recorded a deficit of 41,422m. denars in 2023, according to official figures. General government gross debt totalled 414,070m. denars in 2022, equivalent to 52.1% of GDP. At the end of 2021 the country’s external debt totalled US&#160;$10,840m., of which $5,099m. was public and publicly guaranteed debt. In that year the cost of servicing long-term public and publicly guaranteed debt and repayments to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was equivalent to 16.2% of the value of exports of goods, services and income (excluding workers’ remittances). The annual rate of inflation averaged 3.3% in 2014-23. Consumer prices increased by 14.1% in 2022 and by 9.4% in 2023. The rate of unemployment was 14.4% in 2022.</p>

        In October 2009 the European Commission recommended the opening of accession negotiations; however, an unresolved dispute with Greece over the country’s constitutional name prevented endorsement of the recommendation. Following a prolonged political crisis, a new Government formed in May 2017 pledged to accelerate economic reforms and pursue Euro-Atlantic integration. An agreement providing for a settlement to the name dispute was signed with Greece in June 2018. Cross-border energy and transport projects with Greece were planned. Although in March 2020 EU member states finally reached agreement on opening accession negotiations with North Macedonia, in November a bilateral dispute with Bulgaria presented a further obstacle (see 
        <i>Other External Relations</i>
        ). Meanwhile, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the disbursement of some €176.5m. in emergency financial assistance was approved by the IMF in April. Growth resumed at a rate of 4.5% in 2021 (after a contraction of 4.7% in 2020). However, further economic recovery was impeded by the impact of the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, which precipitated a sharp rise in energy and food prices. The Government declared a state of energy crisis in August, due to severe supply shortages, and in September it was extended until the end of April 2023. In November 2022 the IMF approved a two-year arrangement totalling about €530m. for North Macedonia under its Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL). In 2022 GDP growth slowed to an estimated rate of 2.2%. Although consumer price inflation moderated in 2023, the Government in late November announced a ninth package of anti-crisis measures, allocating €662m. in targeted assistance to alleviate the prolonged effects of the energy crisis for citizens and businesses. In January 2024 the IMF concluded the first review under the PLL arrangement (which allowed the authorities access to around €200m.), noting economic recovery supported by a favourable net export position. Nevertheless, the rate of GDP growth was 2.5% in 2023, according to the IMF, amid declines in external demand and in investment. Meanwhile, a compromise agreement reached in the dispute with Bulgaria had allowed EU accession negotiations to be launched in July 2022; however, political opposition in North Macedonia to constitutional amendments required under the accord prevented its implementation and consequently obstructed progress in the accession process.
