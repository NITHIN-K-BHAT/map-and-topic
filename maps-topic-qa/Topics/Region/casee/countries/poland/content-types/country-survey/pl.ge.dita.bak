          <p id="PL.GEOG.1">The Republic of Poland is located to the north of central Europe, with a 520-km (323-mile) coastline along the Baltic Sea. To the west lies Germany, to the south-west the Czech Republic and to the south Slovakia. To the north is the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad Oblast on the Baltic coast; there is a short border with Lithuania to the north-east; while Belarus lies beyond the northern part of the eastern border, and Ukraine beyond the southern. After the Second World War Poland lost a considerable amount of territory to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), principally in present-day Belarus and Ukraine, while gaining the former German provinces of Pomerania and Silesia in the west, and part of East Prussia in the east. Poland’s borders are now marked by the Oder (Odra) and Neisse (Nysa) rivers in the west, the River Bug in the east, the Sudetic Mountains in the south-west and the Carpathian range of mountains in the south-east. The country has an area of 312,705 sq&#160;km (120,736&#160;sq&#160;miles), some 20% less than in 1939.</p>
          <p id="PL.GEOG.2">Poland is a predominantly low-lying country, the average altitude being only 173&#160;m (474 ft). The highest point in the country is 2,499&#160;m, at Rysy on the border with Slovakia. The most developed and most highly populated region is the central plain, which covers more than one-third of the country. The plain is crossed by Poland’s two major rivers, the Oder and the Vistula (Wisła), which rise in the Sudetic and Carpathian mountains, respectively, along the southern borders, and flow into the Baltic Sea. South of the plain there is a plateau (average height 700&#160;m) which is drained by the Bug, San and Vistula rivers. On the southern border of Poland, between the Sudetic range in the west and the western reaches of the Carpathians in the east, lies the broad depression of the Moravian Gate, which is the traditional route into Central Europe. North of the central plains there are belts of shallow lakes, surrounded by undulating and wooded countryside. North of this lake district are the coastal lowlands, which are most extensive near the estuaries of the Oder and Vistula. Most of the coastline is covered by sand dunes. There are many beaches and lagoons and few natural harbours.</p>

          <heading>Climate</heading>
          <p id="PL.GEOG.3">Poland’s climate is largely continental, with hot summers and cold winters, although it is more temperate in the west than in the east. The average July temperature in Warsaw is 18°C (65°F), while the average for January is −4°C (25°F). Warsaw has an average annual rainfall of 560&#160;mm, whereas Kraków, in the south, has an annual average of 745&#160;mm.</p>

          <heading>Population</heading>
          <p id="PL.GEOG.4">
      Ethnic Poles constitute some 97% of the total population, making Poland one of the most ethnically homogenous countries in the world. Most of the substantial pre-1939 Ukrainian and Jewish populations either fled the country or were killed during the Nazi occupation. There are still minor communities of Belarusians, Ukrainians and Jews, and small numbers of Greeks, Macedonians, Russians
      
      , Lithuanians, Slovaks, Czechs and Roma. Some ethnic Germans remain in the former German territories of Silesia and Pomerania, although the majority of the Germans living in Poland or in the lands granted to Poland in 1945 were deported after the War. The official language is Polish, a member of the Western Slavonic group. Most of the inhabitants profess Christianity, some 96% of the population being adherents of the Roman Catholic Church.

          <p id="PL.GEOG.5">According to the results of the census of March 2021 the population of Poland was 38,036,118, giving a population density of 122.0 per sq km. According to census results, at March 2021 the population of the capital, Warsaw (Warszawa), was 1,860,281. Other important towns included Kraków (population 800,653), and Łódź (672,929). Since the Second World War there has been a significant movement of the population from rural to urban areas: in 2015 only 39.5% of the population lived in the countryside, compared with 68% in 1946.</p>
