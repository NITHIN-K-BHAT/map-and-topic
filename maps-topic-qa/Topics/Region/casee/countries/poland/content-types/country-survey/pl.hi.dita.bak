       a tribal leader, Mieszko I (Mieczysław), established control over areas of present-day Poland. The emerging state of Gniezno incorporated Mazovia and Pomerania. In 966 Mieszko I converted to Latin Christianity. In 1025 Mieszko’s son, Bolesław I (`the Brave’), was crowned as the first King of Poland. The rule of Kazimierz III (Casimir `the Great’) during 1333-70 is regarded as the height of the kingdom’s powers. Internal stability was concomitant with the extension of control over Ruthenia and Galicia (now mostly in Ukraine) as well as the Pomeranian coast. In 1569 the Polish kingdom and Lithuania formalized an earlier personal union, thus creating a multi-ethnic and multi-religious `Commonwealth’. The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ended in 1795, when it was partitioned by the three empires (of Austria, Prussia and Russia) that bordered the Commonwealth. The Polish state was reconstructed after proclaiming independence in October 1918, following the defeat of Germany and Austria-Hungary in the First World War, and a subsequent war with Bolshevik Russia in 1919-21. However, the restoration of Poland as a European state was short-lived. In September 1939 Poland was attacked by Nazi Germany, while Soviet forces took advantage of the German victories to occupy areas in the East.

          <heading>The Period of Communist Rule</heading>
          <p>During the Second World War Poland’s population was depleted by nearly 20%, and its Jewish community was eradicated. Polish territories were liberated by the Soviet army in 1945. However, the first post-War administration was installed by the Soviet authorities, reflecting their desire to maintain control over political developments in Poland. At the Yalta Conference in Crimea (in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics—USSR) in February 1945, the British, US and Soviet leaders agreed that Poland would be compensated by the incorporation of previously German areas into Poland’s borders. The result was the creation of the so-called Oder-Neisse line, while in the east Poland lost territories to the Lithuanian, Belarusian and Ukrainian republics of the USSR. Post-war Poland was ethnically homogenous and predominantly Catholic. In January 1947, by means of fraudulent elections, a communist-dominated Government was established. Poland was closely tied to the USSR through a number of treaties: militarily through the Warsaw Pact of May 1955 and economically through the Council of Mutual Economic Assistance formed in January 1949. Although in 1956, following the earlier death of Soviet leader Stalin (Iosif Dzhugashvili) and the political realignment of the new Soviet authorities, hopes were entertained that the Polish communist leadership would be allowed to pursue a `Polish road to socialism’, these proved illusory.</p>
          <p>The communist regime in Poland presided over a process of rapid transformation. Poland moved from being a predominantly agrarian society to an industrial one. Urbanization and modernity became key goals. In the early 1970s Edward Gierek, the First Secretary of the Polska Zjednoczona Partia Robotnicza (PZPR—Polish United Workers’ Party) obtained loans from Western European states. By 1975 Poland was struggling to repay foreign loans, with 25% of earnings from foreign trade (rising to 36% in 1976) allocated to servicing foreign debt. The collapse of the economy had a profound effect on living standards. In October 1978 Cardinal Archbishop Karol Wojtyła of Kraków became Pope John Paul II, giving impetus to the dissident movement.</p>
          <p>Labour unrest reached a crisis in mid-1980, when workers at the Gdańsk shipyard staged an occupation strike to demand the right to form free trade unions. On 31 August a significant agreement was signed by the representatives of the striking workers and government ministers, with the result that the communist Government allowed the workers to form an independent trade union. This victory had momentous implications for the process through which the communist regime was undermined. Owing to the continuing economic problems and the plummeting authority of the ruling communist regime, the trade union Solidarność (Solidarity) in effect became an opposition party. In December 1981 martial law was declared. All civil authority was transferred to a Military Council, headed by Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski. Dissidents and Solidarność activists were arrested, the most prominent of these being Lech Wałęsa, the leader of the Gdańsk strikers and Solidarność. By mid-1988 Jaruzelski accepted that future stability could be achieved only if Solidarność activists and the dissidents became party to decisions concerning Poland’s future. On 6 February 1989 round table negotiations between the two sides began. On 5 April the meetings were concluded with an historic agreement that would allow 35% of the seats in the lower chamber, the Sejm (Assembly), to be subject to free elections, with the remainder to be allocated to candidates of the PZPR. The formation of an upper chamber, the Senat (Senate) and a presidency, to which—by agreement between all parties—Jaruzelski was nominated as the only candidate, completed the principal reforms.</p>

          <heading>Transition to Parliamentary Democracy</heading>
          <p>The first Government after legislative elections in June 1989, in which Solidarność won 99% of the contested seats, while the PZPR retained 65% of seats in the Assembly, was formed in September by Tadeusz Mazowiecki. The prerogatives of President Jaruzelski (elected by the legislature in July) were extensive and included the appointment of the Ministers of the Interior and of Defence, and the Governor of the National Bank of Poland. Leszek Balcerowicz, an economist who had studied in the USA, was nominated to the post of Minister of Finance.</p>
          <p>The first direct election to the presidency, in November 1990, was contested by both Mazowiecki and Wałęsa, and won by Wałęsa. The first fully free legislative elections took place on 27 October 1991. The `Balcerowicz Plan’, a radical reform programme introduced in January 1990 has been described as `shock therapy’, having been influenced by neoliberal monetarist theories advocated by US economists. The reduction of state investment was accompanied by wage freezes. By mid-1990 the first legislation permitting privatization was approved by the Assembly. Poland underwent a rapid transformation from a single-party state into a liberal-democratic model. The implementation of economic changes resulted in the introduction of free market mechanisms in place of state controls.</p>
          <p>From 1985 the USSR sought to improve relations with the West, and the reunification of Germany became an important objective in this policy. Mazowiecki secured the vital commitment that a united Germany would respect Poland’s borders. Mazowiecki had realized that it was essential that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) assume responsibility for Poland’s security, and, during a visit to Belgium in 1990, requested that Poland be admitted to the European Union (EU). The process of transformation at the apex of the political structure was accompanied by the emergence of civil society.</p>

          <heading>The Wałęsa Presidency</heading>
          <p>The period of Wałęsa’s presidency was marked by a high degree of political volatility. This was manifested by a centre-right coalition victory during the 1991 elections, followed by a shift in support to a coalition of Sojusz Lewicy Demokratycznej (SLD—Democratic Left Alliance), which was dominated by Socjaldemokracja Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej (SdRP—Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland), and the Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe (PSL—Polish People’s Party) in the September 1993 legislative elections. During 1990-95 the repercussions of the economic transformation became apparent, dividing Poland into areas of blight and unemployment on the one hand and of new foreign investment and progress on the other. The political discourse was dominated by recriminations about the consequences of the Balcerowicz Plan. Formed in December 1991, the centre-right Government of Jan Olszowski remained in office until June 1992. Antoni Macierewicz, the Minister of Internal Affairs and a deputy of the Zjednoczenie Chrześcijańsko-Narodowe (ZChN—Christian-National Union), denounced a number of prominent politicians, including members of the Government and the President himself, for allegedly having been communist agents. The Government’s attempt to establish control over the situation by proposing a verification bill in the Assembly prompted further criticism from the nationalist parties, and the crisis resulted in the Government being removed from office by a motion of no confidence. Balcerowicz, meanwhile, had been replaced as Minister of Finance soon after the elections. On 5 June the President appointed Waldemar Pawlak, the leader of the PSL, as Prime Minister. However, Pawlak remained in that post for only 33 days.</p>
          <p>Established on 11 July 1992, the Government of Hanna Suchocka came into being as a result of an eight-party coalition agreement, dominated by the ZChN and Mazowiecki’s Unia Demokratyczna (Democratic Union). Of importance were the first government decisions regarding the restructuring of the banking and financial sector. The Suchocka Government was removed from office on 28 May 1993, when the Assembly adopted a vote of no confidence proposed by the Solidarność group. Wałęsa decided to dissolve the Assembly and schedule early elections.</p>
          <p>The second free elections, held on 19 September 1993, unexpectedly resulted in a defeat for the Solidarność group. Although the various parties that had emerged from the Solidarność movement since 1991 had secured 24.8% of the votes cast, they had been critically weakened by their lack of unity. The post-communist SLD obtained 20.4% of the votes and the PSL 15.4%. These two parties formed a Government, under the premiership of Pawlak. The ruling coalition was in reality led by Aleksander Kwaśniewski of the SLD, who made it clear that he intended to seek the presidency in 1995. Thus, two political conflicts took place simultaneously. The first, led by Wałęsa against Pawlak, developed over the national budget. The President and the Prime Minister were also in conflict over the appointment of the Ministers of Defence and of Foreign Affairs. The ongoing animosity between the two reached a crisis in February 1995, when Wałęsa insisted that he had dissolved the Assembly and intended to schedule further elections. The Assembly disagreed. This situation provided Kwaśniewski with an opportunity to gain an advantage over the PSL (the SLD having been dissatisfied with its coalition partner’s unwillingness to approve further economic reforms). Consequently, the SLD proposed that Józef Oleksy replace Pawlak as Prime Minister. One of the few notable achievements during the Wałęsa presidency was Poland’s formal application in April 1994 to join the EU.</p>

          <heading>The Kwaśniewski Presidency</heading>
          <p>In 1993-95 Polish voters preferred post-communist parties to the newly emerging post-Solidarność ones. A total of 17 candidates contested the presidential election in November 1995. The Catholic Church supported nationalist and Christian candidates. Kwaśniewski, who secured 51.7% of the votes in the second round, had a communist background (as Chairman of the SdRP and formerly a leading member of the PZPR), no religious beliefs, and made a clear commitment to seek Poland’s membership of the EU and NATO. Wałęsa narrowly lost the election, receiving 48.3% of votes. Nevertheless, Kwaśniewski signed a Concordat that governed relations between the state and the Roman Catholic Church, and did not reduce the power of the Church. The outcome of the presidential election caused a further restructuring among political organizations. Solidarność’s new leader, Marian Krzaklewski, initiated the formation of a new political grouping in preparation for the next legislative and presidential elections. Known as Akcja Wyborcza Solidarność (AWS—Solidarity Electoral Action), it united 36 disparate parties and pressure groups.</p>
          <p>In April 1997 the Assembly approved a new Constitution, which had been drafted following extensive discussions between all parties. In October 2000 President Kwaśniewski secured a second term in office, receiving 53.9% of the votes cast in the first round.</p>
          <p>The legislative elections held on 21 October 1997 marked a further shift in popular support, to the centre-right parties. The AWS became the largest group in the legislature, but needed a coalition partner to form a government. After a lengthy period, a coalition comprising the AWS and the Unia Wolności (UW—Freedom Union), led by Balcerowicz, emerged. The AWS’s main policies were to secure state support for employees, pro-family funding, protectionist policies towards Polish enterprises, and the promotion of national and social values. The UW represented the intellectual community, which had opposed the communist regime and which supported secular democratic principles with a commitment to free market principles. Balcerowicz’s return as Minister of Finance was regarded as the most surprising development, the UW having campaigned on the basis of continuing the rapid programme of fiscal transformation and privatization. This coalition Government was headed by Jerzy Buzek of Solidarność. The AWS and the UW disagreed with each other regarding expenditure on social projects, the state national insurance scheme and the conditions for accession to the EU. The AWS demonstrated little enthusiasm for European integration (again in conflict with the UW, which had a clear commitment to Poland becoming a member of the EU). In 2000 the UW finally withdrew from the governing coalition. In the mean time, in February 1999 Poland joined NATO, a decision that was supported by all parties.</p>
          <p>The legislative elections of 23 September 2001 were notable for the transfer in the allegiances of most of the electorate, who widely voted for different parties from those they had supported in the previous elections. Voters were attracted by parties with clearly defined political objectives. Of these, the SLD appeared to offer the clearest programme for remedying the economic stalemate, unemployment and the previous administration’s failure to reform education and health care provision. The SLD, which had established an electoral coalition with the leftist Unia Pracy (UP—Union of Labour), won 41% of the total votes cast. The PSL subsequently joined the coalition and a new Government was formed, under the premiership of the SLD leader, Leszek Miller.</p>
          <p>Miller and Kwaśniewski supported Poland’s application to join NATO and the EU. The EU was viewed as a threat to Polish agricultural interests. The Church campaigned against EU membership, fearing the growth of secularization. Miller and Kwaśniewski were, none the less, able to benefit from the collapse of the post-Solidarność bloc and progressed with the accession negotiations. In March 2002 Polish Catholic Primate Cardinal Józef Glemp’s public support for Poland’s membership of the EU was regarded as a significant achievement. In May 2004 Poland became a member state of the EU.</p>
          <p>By 2002, however, conflicts within the coalition Government had become apparent. The PSL and SLD differed on major economic policies, especially those relating to the agricultural sector. The SLD leadership, in particular Miller, was damaged by accusations of corruption and abuse of office. On 2 May 2004 Miller resigned and was replaced by former Minister of Finance Marian Belka.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the post-Solidarność movement regrouped, forming two distinct new parties in 2001: Platforma Obywatelska (PO—Civic Platform) represented a centre-liberal orientation, whereas Prawo i Sprawiedliwość (PiS—Law and Justice), led by Jarosław Kaczyński, was regarded as conservative and populist. Following the failures of the previous right-wing parties, Liga Polskich Rodzin (LPR—League of Polish Families), a nationalist and conservative Catholic party, emerged, and became closely connected to the media outlets owned by controversial priest Tadeusz Rydzyk.</p>
          <p>Elections to the European Parliament were conducted in June 2004. PO won 15 seats, followed by the LPR (10), PiS (seven), the SRP (six), an SLD-UP alliance (five), the UW (four), the PSL (four) and Socjaldemokracja Polski (Polish Social Democracy—three). Turnout was 20.9%.</p>

          <heading>The Lech Kaczyński Presidency</heading>
          <p>Legislative elections took place on 25 September 2005, and were followed by two rounds of the presidential election on 9 and 23 October. In the elections to the Assembly, PiS obtained 27.0% of votes cast, while PO won 24.1%. Disputes over the distribution of portfolios, notably those of the interior, security and justice, made it impossible for the two parties to form a coalition. At the second round of the presidential election, Lech Kaczyński, the twin brother of Jarosław, emerged as the winner, with 54.0% of the votes, defeating the leader of PO, Donald Tusk. At the same time a coalition dominated by PiS, but also including the SRP and the LPR, was negotiated. The formation of the new Government, under the premiership of Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz of PiS, was announced in May 2006. In July, following the resignation of Marcinkiewicz, Lech Kaczyński nominated Jarosław as Prime Minister. The dissolution of the Assembly, in September 2007, and the decision to schedule early elections were regarded as a means to resolving the ensuing political instability.</p>
          <p>Lech Kaczyński’s popularity declined rapidly. His presidency was associated with the removal of officials from their positions and their replacement through personal appointments. An attempt to purge senior members of the judiciary failed. The early legislative elections of 21 October 2007 reversed the results of the 2005 elections. PO won a decisive victory, with 41.5% of votes cast, while PiS secured 32.1%. Consequently, in November PO and the PSL formed a coalition Government headed by Tusk. On 10 April 2010 President Kaczyński was killed in an air crash near Smolensk, Russia, while travelling to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the massacre of Polish officers by Soviet troops at Katyn, Russia. Senior officials accompanying the President, including the heads of all the military services, were also killed.</p>

          <heading>The Bronisław Komorowski Presidency</heading>
          <p>On 4 July 2010 Bronisław Komorowski, the Marshal of the Assembly (who had temporarily assumed the presidency in April) was elected President, securing 53.0% of the votes cast in a second round of voting and defeating Jarosław Kaczyński. The President and the premier of the ruling coalition were both members of PO. Following the legislative elections held on 9 October 2011 PO, which secured 39.2% of the votes, formed a new coalition Government with the PSL, which had won 8.4%. Tusk once again headed the administration. The election results were surprising in two respects. PiS lost nine seats in the legislature (with 29.9% of the votes) in spite of Kaczyński’s repeated demands that further investigations be undertaken into the Smolensk incident, claiming that there was evidence of a Russian conspiracy.</p>
          <p>The PO-PSL coalition Government was held accountable for high unemployment, while reforms of the pension and national insurance schemes had not been widely welcomed. In late November 2013 the Government announced the replacement of the ministers responsible, respectively, for National Education, Higher Education, the Environment, Sport and Tourism, Regional Development and Transport, Administration, and Finance. The replacement of Jacek Rostowski by Mateusz Szczurek as Minister of Finance was the most important change. His stated aim had been to reduce the national debt and to stimulate the economy.</p>
          <p>Instability in Ukraine from late 2013 led to a major review of Polish military plans. Hitherto, assessments of Polish security had been based on three factors: Poland’s membership of NATO and of the EU, and agreements with the USA. However, the events in Ukraine revealed starkly that these would count for little should Russia decide to take action on Poland’s eastern borders. The Government’s response was to attempt to reinforce NATO’s commitment to collective security, while concluding that Polish territory could only be defended if troops were based in the country. The Russian annexation of the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine in early 2014, shortly after the country’s pro-Russian President had fled to Russia, had particular impact in Poland. Radosław Sikorski, the Polish Minister for Foreign Affairs, declared support for the new Ukrainian leadership. Around 2,420 Polish troops continued to participate in the activities of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan until the end of 2014, when all ISAF responsibilities were handed over to Afghan military units.</p>
          <p>
      The rate of participation in the elections to the European Parliament that took place in Poland on 25 May 2014 was low, at 22.7%. PO and PiS each secured 19 seats, while the left wing, led by the SLD, obtained five seats and the Kongres Nowej Prawicy (Congress of the New Right) four. The election results confirmed the enduring political impasse between PO and PiS. In June the Government experienced embarrassment when the weekly political journal, 
      <i>Wprost</i>
      , published transcripts of clandestine recordings of private conversations between prominent government officials. Sikorski, Rostowki and central bank Governor Marek Belka were recorded making unguarded comments, prompting accusations of sexism and racism. On 1 December Donald Tusk took over as President of the European Council, having resigned as Prime Minister in September. His nomination to the EU post had been supported by the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the British Prime Minister, David Cameron. Since PO and the PSL had earlier agreed to nominate Ewa Kopacz to succeed Tusk, the transfer of power was completed smoothly. When Kopacz, who had previously held the posts of Marshal of the Assembly and Minister of Health, presented her Government, the greatest surprise was her decision to move Sikorski from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the post of Marshal of the Assembly. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was taken over by Grzegorz Schetyna.
    </p>
          <p>Tusk assumed the presidency of the European Council at a difficult time. The Greek economic crisis, in particular, represented a significant problem for the EU, and the political crisis in Ukraine presented the EU with another challenge. Tusk’s determination that Russia should be warned of the consequences of any continued involvement in Ukraine (where a Russian-backed insurgency was under way in two eastern regions) contrasted with his continuation of negotiations with the Greek authorities. Tusk was confronted with the immigration and refugee crisis that engulfed southern Europe from mid-2015, which was exacerbated by an escalation of conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic.</p>

          <heading>The Andrzej Duda Presidency</heading>
          <p>The presidential election took place on 10 and 24 May 2015, when a little-known PiS candidate, Andrzej Duda, unexpectedly defeated the incumbent President. In the first round, at which the rate of voter participation was 49.0%, Duda secured 34.8% of the votes cast, while Komorowski obtained 33.8% and, in an unanticipated development, Paweł Kukiz, a singer, took 20.8%. In the second round, Duda confirmed his narrow victory, with 51.6% of the votes cast; Komorowski received 48.5%. Most young people voted for Duda, as did those living in Poland’s provinces. Duda had campaigned on a simple programme of promises for change. Tusk’s departure had deprived PO of a leader who was skilled at connecting with the electorate. The party had focused on the retired and professional groups. The elections to the Assembly and the Senate took place on 25 October, and the results indicated a major reorientation in voting preferences. The participation rate was 50.9%. PiS won an outright majority, with 37.6% of the votes, followed by PO, with 24.1%. Unexpectedly, Kukiz’15 (Kukiz’s movement, with broadly anti-establishment policies), won 8.8% of the votes. In fourth place was the newly established liberal Nowoczesna (Modern) party, which secured 7.6% of the votes. Zjednoczona Lewica (United Left), a coalition led by the SLD, secured 7.5% of the votes, while the PSL won 5.1%. Following the defeat of the left-wing and agrarian parties, Nowoczesna assumed the role of opposition party. Formed and led by Ryszard Petru, an economist, it presented a mixture of progressive and modernist ideas.</p>
          <p>The Government was sworn in on 16 November 2015. Prime Minister Beata Szydło’s announcement of the list of new ministers caused deep consternation. The appointment of Antoni Macierewicz as Minister of National Defence was controversial. Kaczyński, an Assembly deputy, sought no post in the Government, but remained the Chairman of PiS. The Government’s determination to change the membership of the Constitutional Tribunal represented the most unexpected challenge to accepted procedures. The crisis began in October 2015, when the outgoing Assembly appointed five new judges to the Tribunal. Duda refused to swear them in, and the incoming Government questioned the legality of the nominations. In December the PiS-dominated Assembly approved government nominations in their place, and then adopted legislation to change the Tribunal’s functions. The new judges were immediately sworn in by the President. This crisis led to widespread accusations that the Government was seeking to change the Constitution. The European Commission also expressed concern at the Government’s actions in relation to the Constitutional Tribunal, but refrained from condemning Poland outright. The new Government refused to co-operate with EU policy on the resettlement of refugees from the Middle East, stating that their presence would pose a threat to Polish identity and Christian values.</p>
          <p>Szydło’s Government intended to transform Polish society and political life. The full implications of this policy became immediately apparent when the Government introduced a monthly child benefit payment of 500 złoty. Attempts to make it virtually impossible for any woman to obtain an abortion legally led to mass demonstrations. In all areas the Government’s policy was to replace specialists with political appointments. Patriotic fervour continued to be fuelled by monthly commemorations of the Smoleńsk air crash. The role of Kaczyński has continued to be controversial; neither government ministers, including Prime Ministers, nor the President have appeared willing to act independently of him.</p>
          <p>Two international events have had a wide-ranging impact for Polish politics. The decision of the United Kingdom (where more than 400,000 Polish nationals were registered to work) to leave the EU, following a national referendum in June 2016, and the election of President Donald Trump in the USA in November were both sources of deep concern in Poland. During the 2016 US presidential election campaign, Trump sought the support of the Polish community in the USA by assuring them that, if elected, he would increase the numbers of US visas available to Poles. He also maintained that Polish security was of concern to the USA. However, Trump’s contradictory statements concerning the functions of NATO, which is perceived in Poland as an important guarantor of security against Russia, together with signs of co-operation between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, were met with foreboding. None the less, on 7 July 2017 President Trump visited Poland, meeting President Duda and receiving a popular welcome.</p>
          <p>In March 2017 Szydło placed Poland in open conflict with the European Council when she became the only national leader to oppose Tusk’s re-election as President of the Council, which was approved by the other 27 member states. However, the most serious conflict concerned the reforms of the judiciary. Zbigniew Ziobro, the Minister of Justice, maintained a policy of restructuring the judiciary by reducing the authority of both the Constitutional Tribunal and the National Council of the Judiciary, two important bodies intended to act as guarantors of democracy and the independence of the Polish judiciary. Although these reforms were vetoed by President Duda later that month, in September he proposed further amended legislation, which was adopted by the Senate on 15 December; this included measures to terminate the mandate of serving judges of the National Council of the Judiciary and provide for the appointment of its future judges by the legislature, and to lower the retirement age of Supreme Court judges from 70 to 65. On 20 December the European Commission recommended to the Council of the EU that it prepare to initiate sanctions against Poland under Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union, which would launch a process whereby Poland would be punished for its failure to uphold the principles governing EU member states. On 14 May 2018 the European Commission announced a further ultimatum that Poland demonstrate compliance with the EU warnings by late June. Although Article 7 is unspecific, one potential sanction would be to suspend Poland’s voting rights in the EU. Parliamentary opposition to the PiS-led Government’s reforms was limited. It was observed that PO and Nowoczesna failed to ally themselves with the disaffection and anger that were articulated by civic organizations during mass protests.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, on 7 December 2017 Prime Minister Szydło was replaced by Mateusz Morawiecki, hitherto the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Development and of Finance. On 9 January 2018 a government reorganization was announced. These changes appeared to be intended to persuade the EU that the Polish authorities were responding to criticism. Morawiecki had extensive banking experience. Jacek Czaputowicz was appointed as the new Minister of Foreign Affairs and Mariusz Błaszczak, a principal ally of Kaczyński and hitherto interior minister, became Minister of National Defence.</p>
          <p>On 6 February 2018 legislation was signed into law by President Duda which made it a criminal offence (punishable by up to three years’ imprisonment) to ascribe responsibility for the Holocaust to Poland or Poles. This legislation was mainly designed to prevent continuing media references to `Polish death camps’, rather than `German death camps in occupied Polish territories’. In response to the outrage expressed against the Holocaust law in the USA and Western Europe, as well as by Israel, the Government amended the legislation to make such references to Polish death camps a civil rather than a criminal offence; the amendment was approved by both parliamentary chambers on 27 June.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, elections to the provincial assemblies and mayoralties took place on 21 October 2018, with a second round of voting on 4 November. PiS retained support in rural areas and smaller towns, but lost the contest in key towns and cities, including Gdańsk, Szczecin, Kraków, Olsztyn, Łódź, Białystok, Lublin and Rzeszów, which all elected mayors from PO. Most unexpected, however, was the election of Rafał Trzaskowski, also of PO, as Mayor of Warsaw. </p>
          <p>The ongoing conflicts with the judiciary continued unabated. In October 2018 the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ordered the Polish Government to reinstate several Supreme Court judges who had been forced into early retirement after the law was amended in July, and the ECJ issued an official warning to Ziobro. The PiS leadership, including Kaczyński and Ziobro, used public and international criticism of Polish judicial reforms to reinforce their nationalist credentials. </p>
          <p>The murder of the highly popular and longstanding Mayor of Gdańsk, Paweł Adamowicz, at a public charity event on 13 January 2019, drew attention to the extent to which the domestic political debate had become inflammatory and adversarial. The popularity of PiS continued, however, in part owing to Poland experiencing a period of economic prosperity and stability. The introduction of child benefits and the lowering of the statutory date of retirement have proved highly popular with the electorate. In May all Poles presently in receipt of pensions were eligible for an additional one-off payment.</p>
          <p>Elections to the European Parliament were held on 26 May 2019. PiS took 45.4% of the valid votes cast and 26 seats, the Koalicja Europejska (European Coalition) took 38.5% and 22 seats, and the progressive, pro-European Wiosna (Spring), formed by Robert Biedroń, a breakaway member of the SLD, took 6.1% and three seats. The turnout was 45.7%, which was high by Polish standards in European elections. PiS contested the elections with a clear pro-European programme; its main aim was to establish a stronger voice for Poland in the EU. Notably, no Eurosceptic party secured enough votes to take seats in the European Parliament. In early June Prime Minister Morawiecki reorganized the cabinet, as several members of the Government, including former Prime Minister Szydło, were elected as Members of the European Parliament. The Minister of Finance, Teresa Czerwińska, was replaced by Marian Banas.</p>
          <p>Elections to the Assembly and the Senate took place on 13 October 2019. The participation rate, at 61.7% of the electorate, was over 10% higher than in the 2015 elections. In the Assembly, PiS notably increased its share of the vote to 43.6%, retaining its majority of 235 seats in the Assembly. PO had formed the Koalicja Obywatelska (Civic Coalition) electoral bloc, which included Nowoczesna and the Partia Zieloni (Green Party), but was nevertheless defeated, with 27.4% of the votes and 134 seats. The Lewica (the Left) alliance, led by the SLD, won 12.6% of votes and 49 seats, marking the return of left-wing parties to the Assembly. The other unexpected new political force in the Assembly was the right-wing Konfederacja Wolność i Niepodległość (Confederation Freedom and Independence), which obtained 6.8% and 11 seats. The PSL contested the elections as part of the Koalicja Polska, securing 8.6% and 30 seats. However, the elections created a new political situation by changing the balance of power in the Senate in favour of the opposition, rather than the ruling party. PiS secured 48 seats in the Senate (compared with 61 previously), while the opposition dominated by PO held 51 seats (with one non-aligned candidate).</p>
          <p>In December 2019 Vladimir Putin precipitated what became a fierce dispute with Prime Minister Morawiecki, denouncing a resolution adopted by the European Parliament in September which implied that by signing the Treaty of Non-Aggression with Germany (the Nazi-Soviet Pact) in August 1939 the USSR bore some responsibility for the outbreak of the Second World War.</p>
          <p>The PiS electoral victory was followed by further attacks on the independence of the judiciary. In November 2019 three judges were forced to retire from the Constitutional Tribunal, after which the Government appointed their replacements. In January 2020 the EU condemned Poland for this decision and for the creation of a disciplinary chamber of the Supreme Court, having ruled that this contravened the EU principles of maintaining an independent judiciary. In April the ECJ upheld the EU’s condemnation of Poland, demanding that the country suspend provisions on the powers of the disciplinary chamber; nevertheless, the reforms of the judiciary continued.</p>
          <p>The first round of the presidential election was scheduled to take place on 10 May 2020, with PiS extremely confident of Duda’s victory. As the COVID-19 pandemic engulfed Europe, however, the Polish Government declared a state of epidemiological emergency on 14 March. In early June the Marshal of the Assembly, Elżbieta Witek, rescheduled the presidential election for 28 June. At the first round, which was contested by a total of 11 candidates, the incumbent, Duda, failed to win outright but was first-placed, with 43.5% of the votes cast, while his main PO opponent, Mayor of Warsaw Trzaskowski, received 30.5% of the votes. Duda won the second round on 12 July, with 51.0% of votes cast (the narrowest victory in a presidential election since the end of communist rule in 1989). The voter participation rate was 64.5% in the first round and 68.2% in the second. The 2020 presidential election and the results of the 2019 legislative elections had given the ruling PiS absolute control of the Assembly.</p>
          <p>Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Poland’s economy was stable and wages were high. Most people were still profiting in real terms from the Government’s child benefit programme and additional annual pension payments. The Government, however, succumbed to damaging infighting between the three parties that formed the Zjednoczona Prawica (United Right) ruling coalition: PiS, Solidarna Polska (United Poland), led by Minister of Justice Ziobro, and Porozumienie (Agreement), led by Jarosław Gowin. Following the legislative and presidential elections, Ziobro continuously attacked Morawiecki for his supposed excessive subordination to the EU and Russia. Nevertheless, the opposition has been ineffective.</p>
          <p>By mid-2022 the COVID-19 pandemic had resulted in over 115,000 fatalities in Poland, exposing weakness in health care provision and management. Depending on the region, between 60% and 90% of those admitted to high-dependency hospital wards died. The Government was accused of ineptitude in its response to the pandemic and of having failed to prepare for the subsequent waves of infection.</p>
          <p>The Government used its strong political position to complete a number of legislative measures, and new restrictions on abortion attracted widespread opposition. In October 2020 the Constitutional Tribunal ruled that abortion in the case of foetal defect was unconstitutional, thereby completing a long progression towards making it almost impossible for women in Poland to obtain legal abortions. An ensuing period of public protests had little impact on the Government, which argued that the Tribunal and not the Assembly had made the decision. A resolution adopted in November by the European Parliament that strongly criticized Polish restrictions on abortion also had no effect.</p>
          <p>In March 2021 the European Commission condemned the reforms of the judicial system that had been introduced by the Polish Government in 2019 and entered into effect in February 2021. The lengthy process of the EU’s response to reforms that were considered to violate the principle of judicial independence continued. In July, shortly after the ECJ again demanded that Poland suspend the powers of the judicial disciplinary chamber, the Constitutional Tribunal ruled that the temporary injunctions issued by the Court were incompatible with the Polish Constitution and therefore not binding.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the ratification of the Government’s National Reconstruction Plan, which was necessary to access the EU Reconstruction Fund (requiring approval by all members states), was under discussion by the Assembly. On 4 May 2021 the Assembly adopted the motion, with 290 votes in support and 33 against, and the 133 PO deputies abstaining. The Polish Government hoped to receive €23,900m. in grants and €12,100m. in loans from the EU’s pandemic recovery fund towards implementation of its Polski Ład (Polish Deal) programme of social and economic reconstruction. However, the European Commission on 20 July issued a report presenting its serious concerns about the rule of law in Poland and Hungary, and subsequently announced that it would request the imposition of financial penalties against Poland unless it complied with the earlier ECJ order by 16 August.</p>
          <p>The Government’s determination to demonstrate that it would not necessarily comply with EU rules continued. On 7 October 2021 the Constitutional Tribunal ruled that Polish law took precedence over EU legislation, thus challenging EU principles. Prime Minister Morawiecki attended a meeting of the European Parliament and then went on to a meeting of the European Council in Brussels, Belgium. In both cases he asserted that Poland would not abide by the request to comply with EU law concerning judicial independence. As a result, the EU decided to withhold Poland’s tranche of recovery funding.</p>
          <p>Both sides recognized the impasse in which they had found themselves. The Polish Government could not entirely give up on the EU funds, which formed the basis of its social and economic policies, but the EU recognized that Poland had manoeuvred itself into a challenging position by responding to EU entreaties by continuing with, rather than reversing, its judicial reforms. In October 2021 a daily fine of €1m. was imposed on Poland. Unexpectedly, however, on 26 May 2022 the Assembly voted in favour of abolishing the judicial disciplinary chamber, thus complying with a principal EU demand for the reversal of earlier approved reforms. This represented a victory for President Duda, who was mindful of the economic consequences of the loss of EU funds on Poland’s recovery programme. However, this victory was only partial, since on the same day the Assembly rejected a vote of no confidence in Minister of Justice Ziobro, who had played a major role in the reforms of the judicial process. His party, Solidarna Polska, remained an important member of the ruling coalition at a time when PiS support had been weakening, and the Government could not risk alienating it. At the beginning of June the EU reversed its earlier decision to withhold funds from Poland, although Ursula von der Leyen, who visited Poland on 2 June, confirmed that the release of payments remained dependent on the implementation of further measures to resolve the rule of law dispute with the EU.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, a crisis at Poland’s border with Belarus started in August 2021 and reached a climax later that year. Belarusian security and border forces encouraged thousands of refugees, most of them Muslims from the Middle East and Afghanistan, to cross the border. It subsequently transpired that the refugees had been led to believe that the border between Poland and Belarus was open and that by crossing it they would reach the EU, where they would be able to claim asylum. As the numbers of migrants trying to enter Poland increased dramatically, sometimes reaching 1,000 each day, the Polish Government responded by closing access to the border area and to the crossing points, which were declared to be security zones. The army and border patrols were deployed in order to prevent large numbers of people from crossing into Poland. The EU tried to create a co-ordinated response to the situation on its border, but the Polish Government declined help, preferring to treat the situation as a local crisis.</p>
          <p>The most recent crisis, caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, has underlined Poland’s vulnerability. By July over 1.2m. Ukrainian refugees were registered in Poland and Poland was sympathetic towards the Ukrainians fleeing into Poland. Meanwhile, on 22 May, in a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, Duda confirmed that Poland would support Ukraine’s `fast-track’ application to join the EU. Ukraine and Moldova have been accorded the status of EU candidate countries. Neither the French President, Emmanuel Macron, nor the German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, wished to put the EU in a position of direct confrontation with Russia, preferring instead to work towards some form of long-term solution to the crisis. The continuing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has presented the Polish Government with a dilemma. On the one hand, it believes that there is a need for a strong challenge to Russian aggression, while, on the other hand, it does not wish Ukraine to be cast in the role of the defender of the EU’s Eastern border, which would diminish Poland’s part. The result is that Poland’s responses to EU and NATO policies have been inconsistent, most obviously demonstrated by a dispute that the Polish Government created with Germany. When in November 2022 a Polish border village was hit by a missile (which was subsequently found by NATO to have been fired by Ukrainian air defences), the German Government offered to install two units of Patriot surface-to-air defence systems on Polish territory. Although in principle welcome, this initiative prompted a strong reaction from Kaczyński and Morawiecki, who accused the German Government of trying to establish control over Poland. The dispute escalated when Kaczyński demanded that Germany pay Poland €1,300,000m. in reparations for losses during the Second World War. The issue of the full economic implications of the German occupation of Poland during the war has not been fully debated in the past but the only motive for the Polish Government to open the topic at this time was the prospect of the forthcoming elections to the Assembly, due to take place in late 2023. During 2022 trade with Germany (Poland’s largest trading partner) increased by 14%, with a number of German investors accelerating their plans for collaboration with Poland.</p>
          <p>In April 2023 the European Commission rejected the Polish Government’s request for the suspension of fines that had been imposed on Poland for failure to comply with the orders of the ECJ. At that point, the fines amounted to €526m. and continued to grow, while the Government showed no sign of complying with demands that it guarantee the independence of the judiciary. On the contrary, judges who aligned their decisions with government policies have been promoted.</p>
          <p>By mid-2023 political parties were focused on the next legislative elections, which were likely to be scheduled for October. All opinion polls suggested that Poles are not likely to change their voting preferences. This presented a difficulty for the ruling and opposition parties, which concentrated less on persuading new voters, instead devoting efforts to complex negotiations aiming to form electoral coalitions. Surprisingly, the state of the economy has not been an issue which could be used by campaigning parties. Inflation stood at 13% in May, but this had slowed from a high of 17.2% in February, while incomes were projected to rise by 12% in 2023. Differences between wage earners and those who receive social support and pensions are significant. Pensioners have received 13 and even 14 monthly additional payments to their pensions. PiS, which has always relied on the support of the retired, is challenged by the changing demography. The number of young and working voters, who are not likely to support PiS, is increasing in comparison with the numbers of pensioners.</p>
          <p>
      The elections are expected to be won by either a PiS-led or a PO-led coalition. Tusk has re-entered Polish politics but this has not necessarily benefited PO. PiS has portrayed his term as President of the European Council as a time when he betrayed Polish interests. Tusk himself has tried to reconnect with the Polish electorate, but his pre-election campaigning has not made a significant impact. The composition of the coalitions to be formed before the elections remained undecided at mid-2023. Both Nowa Lewica (NL—New Left), formed in 2021 by a merger of the SLD and Wiosna, and the reconstituted far-right Konfederacja (Confederation) have emerged as significant forces. Commentators have suggested that Konfederacja, rather than NL, might play a pivotal role in the coalition-building processes. Both parties compete for the young electorate and Konfederacja poses a real threat to PiS, having presented a simple campaign programme pledging to `give Poland back’ to the people. It was reported that PiS, which is concerned about an electoral defeat, had already opened discussions with Konfederacja on the possibility of a post-election coalition. Another independent agent in the coalition process is Polska 2050 (Poland 2050), a political platform led by Szymon Hołownia. Its liberal political principles are close to that of PO but it has not put forward a distinct enough programme to attract PO loyalists. At the end of April 2023 Polska 2050 announced that it would enter into an electoral coalition with the PSL rather than PO. The PSL, which represents the rural community, has in the past allied itself with conservative parties. In the 2019 elections the PSL-led alliance secured just over 8% of votes (the threshold for electoral coalitions to gain entry into the Assembly). However, the situation in rural areas has changed due to the war in Ukraine. Although initially Poles welcomed the Ukrainian refugees, as the war continued its consequences and the presence of refugees in Poland increasingly became issues which were broached during political debates. The import of Ukrainian wheat, in particular, is a controversial matter. The Government initially agreed to allow the transit of Ukrainian wheat through Polish territory, but had not expected that the grain would be purchased by producers in Poland, dramatically reducing the income of Polish wheat growers. The availability of cheap Ukrainian wheat on Polish markets ha
      
      d increased by 500%. With local wheat remaining unsold, politicians have once more become aware of the strength of the rural electorate. In April Kaczyński announced that Poland was to close its border to the import of Ukrainian wheat and other agricultural products, despite this being in contravention of EU regulations. He also pledged that the state would purchase Polish wheat at a price higher than international market prices. (An agreement on the transit of Ukrainian grain was subsequently reached.) Kaczyński’s announcement was reportedly timed to support a PiS bid for an electoral coalition with the PSL.
