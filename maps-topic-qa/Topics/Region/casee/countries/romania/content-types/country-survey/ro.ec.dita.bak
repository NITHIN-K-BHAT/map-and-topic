          <heading>Introduction</heading>
          <p>In 2023 the standard of living in Romania, measured as a percentage of the average gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in the European Union (EU), reached 77%. This puts Romania on a par with neighbouring Hungary and Portugal. It is also a major milestone, testifying to the impressive improvement in Romanian economic performance and relative wealth since the country joined the EU in 2007. In 2010 its GDP per capita was only 54% of the EU average. Since then, Romania has outperformed the EU average by a large margin and is on a path to become Eastern Europe’s second largest economy, after Poland, surpassing traditionally stronger Central and Eastern European economies such as Hungary and the Czech Republic (Czechia).</p>
          <p>Romania’s success is the result of a complex mix of factors—market size, the pace of reforms, improving governance—and relations with the EU. Membership of the EU has been one of the most persistent drivers of economic growth in Romania, due to the substantial support from various EU funds since Romania’s accession in 2007, and Romania has been designated to receive up to €80,000m. in EU funding over the current budgeting period until 2027. Combined with the continuing commitment to implement necessary reforms required by the EU, the steady flow of EU funds has enabled successive governments to carry out large infrastructure and reform projects that may have otherwise been difficult to finance.</p>
          <p>In terms of future outlook, notwithstanding the positive economic indicators achieved so far, there remain several challenges to ensuring lasting and sustainable economic growth and development in Romania. Specifically, three factors loom as critical: institutional reforms, especially relating to the rule of law; demographic decline, and associated challenges to pension systems and innovations; and geopolitical risks, related to the deterioration of relations between the Russian Federation and the West since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. This essay reflects on Romania’s economic successes and challenges over the past few years, along with a brief outlook to future prospects.</p>

          <heading>Economic Transition</heading>
          <p>When Romania embarked upon democratic transition, after the Romanian people overthrew the regime of communist leader Nicolae Ceauşescu in late 1989, Romania was one of the poorest countries in Europe. Ceauşescu had pursued an economic policy of self-sufficiency, and unlike many other communist countries in Eastern Europe which borrowed externally to fund consumption and better standards of living, Romania did not incur high debt levels. On the contrary, Ceauşescu had sought to repay all external debt, resulting in particularly painful economic years in the 1980s, when the standard of living plummeted and there were shortages of most goods. </p>
          <p>
      Therefore, more so than in other former communist economies, the economic transition after 1989 in Romania was about (re-)integrating the country into the international economic sphere. This was a slow process, not aided by the lack of political figures with a clear plan for economic reforms in the initial Romanian cabinets after 1989. Indeed, during the early transition years, Romania was led by 
      <!--? PSD not formed until 2001 and PDSR in 1993. Direct successor would be National Salvation Front.-->
      successor organizations of the Partidul Comunist Romãn (Romanian Communist Party), with many of the same political elites controlling key government portfolios. Again, unlike other former-communist states in the region, such as Poland or Hungary, which quickly introduced privatization programmes or economic shock therapy, Romania was slow to begin the transition to a free market economy. This was reflected in the poor economic performance during the 1990s, with GDP contracting by an annual average of around 9% between 1990 and 1993, and by an annual average of about 4% between 1997 and 1999. By the end of the decade the economy had not yet recovered to pre-1989 levels.
    </p>
          <p>Moreover, Romania was not included in the initial wave of the EU’s eastern enlargement in 2004. Unprepared to take on the obligations of EU member states, its accession negotiations were extended until 2007, when, together with Bulgaria, it joined the EU, just ahead of the 2008 financial crisis. With significant issues relating to controversial reforms of the judiciary and rule of law, and persistently high levels of corruption, Romania’s EU membership was made subject to the Co-operation and Verification Mechanism (CVM), which is intended to ensure compliance with EU conditions and requirements following accession. Since 2007 Romania has not joined the EU’s single currency area, nor has it been admitted to the visa-free Schengen area, even though Croatia, which became a member state in 2013, has since joined both. Overcoming the legacies of post-communist transition has been a challenging task, especially when done alongside the demanding process of EU accession negotiations.</p>

          <heading>The Benefits of EU Membership</heading>
          <p>Romania’s progress in reaching the EU’s economic and political standards was slow. However, as the Government’s efforts to meet EU membership criteria gathered momentum in the early 2000s, the positive effects of political and economic reforms became apparent. Economic growth accelerated between 2000 and 2008, with GDP growing at an average annual rate of more than 6% over the decade. Then, although the global financial and economic crises of 2008-10 led to a sharp drop in economic performance, and the economy contracted by 5.5% in 2009 and by 3.9% in 2010, growth resumed from 2011 and continued for the rest of that decade.</p>
          <p>The strong improvement in economic performance was facilitated by opening Romania to foreign investment and trade, and signalling an improving business environment. As an EU candidate state in the early 2000s, Romania was seen as an attractive emerging market: large enough to be selected by large multinationals seeking to enter the region and for its own strong domestic market, with high-skilled and well-educated labour, as well as close enough to the large West European markets for outsourcing production with relatively short supply chains.</p>
          <p>The appeal of the growing Romanian market and relatively cheap labour was further increased with the gradual alignment of Romanian regulations and standards to those of the EU. One of the principal benefits of EU membership, regulatory and policy harmonization with EU rules, substantially reduces policy and regulatory uncertainty for businesses, leading to a particularly attractive mix of low uncertainty due to the EU’s regulatory framework and the high growth potential of an emerging market. That this combination was successful in attracting foreign investors’ interest was demonstrated by the increasing flow of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Romania. Between 2000 and 2009 FDI levels in Romania substantially increased, from around US&#160;$1,000m. in 2000 to a peak of $13,700m. in 2008.</p>
          <p>Another important benefit of EU membership was access to EU’s pre-accession and membership funds. Since becoming a full EU member in 2007, Romania has received around €62,000m. in EU funds. These payments, largely coming from EU’s regional and structural funds, are intended to assist less wealthy EU members in accelerating regional development and reducing the wealth and inequality gaps in the domestic economy, as well as across the EU. As one of the poorest EU members upon accession in 2007, Romania has been one of the largest recipients of EU assistance, and therefore governments have been able to invest in infrastructure, regional and skills development to a level that would have been difficult to sustain had they been relying only on their domestic budget. Since 2021, with the EU’s launch of the EU’s recovery and resilience programme, aimed at enabling a rapid post-pandemic economic recovery across Europe, Romania has been designated to receive some €14,200 in grants and €14,900 in loans by 2027, which will further extend the flow of EU funds into the Romanian economy.</p>
          <p>Finally, Romania has benefited from freedom of movement within the EU since becoming a full member. The ability of Romanians to work and settle across the EU (despite several EU members adopting transition periods before allowing full freedom of movement to Romanians) has helped to reduce poverty and improve standards of living. Remittances from Romanians working abroad have increased rapidly since Romania joined the EU in 2007, but particularly since 2012, when most EU countries lifted the temporary restrictions on Romanians working there. In 2012 Romanians abroad sent home around US&#160;$733m. in remittances. One decade later, in 2022, total remittances reached $11,000m.—a dramatic increase that has led to increasing consumption, investment in education and health care, and an overall reduction in poverty levels. Indeed, the poverty rate over the same period sharply declined, from more than 40% in 2006 to 10.9% in 2022. </p>
          <p>In most respects, EU membership has been hugely beneficial for Romania’s economy, since most economic indicators have markedly improved since the country joined the EU. This is despite the adverse effects of the global financial crisis of 2008 and the subsequent eurozone sovereign debt crisis in 2010-12, which temporarily slowed but did not reverse Romania’s upward economic trajectory over the past 15 of EU membership.</p>

          <heading>A Maturing Market</heading>
          <p>Romania is now well-placed to capitalize on the progress achieved over the past two decades. Its politics, economy and international position are such that it can set the foundation for sustained and sustainable economic growth. Stable democratic political institutions and relatively mainstream government ideology, combined with prudent management of the state economy and sensible foreign and regional policy, mean a positive future outlook.</p>
          <p>
      Politically, Romania is gradually becoming a fully consolidated democracy. Unlike some of its former communist neighbours, Romania has experienced limited democratic regression since it joined the EU. The EU continues to enjoy relatively high levels of public trust among Romanians, and Eurosceptic rhetoric has found almost no support among the electorate and among political elites. Unlike in Poland and Hungary, illiberal and anti-EU political rhetoric remains on the margins of Romania’s political spectrum and such political arguments have very limited mobilization potential among voters. Therefore, Romania generally maintains good relations with the EU. 
      <!--Seems this should be mentioned...-->
      Changes to Romania’s justice legislation adopted in 2017-19 were strongly criticized by the European Commission and in 2021 were judged by the European Court of Justice to be in violation of EU law with regard to the independence of the judiciary; however, the European Commission provisionally recommended in November 2022 that sufficient progress had been made for the CVM to be lifted.
    </p>
          <p>This consensus over Romania’s place in the EU has ameliorated the negative effects of political and government instability. Although Romanian governments do not always manage to survive a full four-year term and many tend to comprise coalitions of several political parties, their policy disagreements generally do not extend to the bigger issues of support for the EU, and pro-business and investment-friendly attitudes. Therefore, although during the past several years there have been periods of government instability, the frequent government changes have had limited impact on the business and economic environments in the country. Indeed, most economic indicators suggest the economy has been largely unaffected by domestic political developments. </p>
          <p>However, the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant short-term impact on the economy. In 2020, for the first time since its economic crisis in 2009-10, Romania’s GDP contracted, by 3.7%. Such a sharp decline led the centre-left Government at the time to take an unprecedented measure of banning the sale of any state-owned assets, even minority stakes to be traded on the stock exchange. Government fears about the declining value of national assets proved shortlived. The economy rebounded in 2021, with GDP growth of 5.9%, and the new Government that took office in that year sought to restore Romania’s reputation as an investment- and business-friendly market. </p>

          <heading>Sound Macroeconomic Indicators</heading>
          <p>Together with the improving political context and international standing, the fundamental macroeconomic indicators of Romania’s economy suggest that the country is on a strong upward trajectory. Growth remained strong at 4.8% in 2022, higher than the average in most EU economies (and lower only than Croatia’s 2022 growth rate of 6.2%). These growth rates are particularly significant in a year when most European economies underwent a substantial downturn, precipitated by the adverse effects of the geopolitical shock caused by the war in Ukraine and the resulting imposition of EU economic sanctions on Russia. Romania shares a border with Ukraine and has accepted thousands of Ukrainian refugees since the start of the war, while suffering disruptions to major supply chains through the Black Sea and across the land border to Ukraine, which are expected to continue. Nevertheless, Romania has also benefited from the relocation of many international businesses that withdrew from Russia after the start of the war. As one of the largest economies in Central and Eastern Europe, Romania has been the choice of many multinationals seeking to move regional offices and facilities away from Russia or Ukraine. </p>
          <p>The EU sanctions on Russia also led to rapidly increasing energy prices across Europe, owing to the high energy dependence of many European countries on Russian natural gas imports. Although Romania is one of the least vulnerable Eastern European countries to cuts in Russian energy and fuel supplies, producing a significant part of the country’s oil and gas requirements, its integration with the EU market means that it is not immune to the economic implications of the energy crises across Europe. In particular, the inflation rate increased to double digits, at 13.8% in 2022, for the first time since 2004. While such an inflation rate is much lower than the high inflation that the country experienced in the early 1990s (the inflation rate between 1989 and 1994 grew from 0.9% to 241%), the Government’s management of the current economic downturn will be an important factor in continued public support, especially for those who went through the painful years during the transition from communism.</p>
          <p>In addition, the Government is looking to restore its fiscal stance to a narrower gap. Although governments have generally refrained from indulging in excessive spending and borrowing over the past two decades, in 2020 the Government recorded a deficit of 9.2% of GDP. This was an unusually high level for a country with an average deficit of about 2% over the past decade, but not exceptional in the EU where most governments adopted support packages to protect the economy and the population from the adverse impacts of the lockdowns and economic restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Deficit levels have been declining since then, to 7.1% in 2021 and 5.8% in 2022, but have still not fallen back to pre-pandemic levels.</p>
          <p>In parallel, debt-to-GDP ratios had been steadily declining over the decade between 2010 and 2020, from 72.1% in 2011 to 48.9% in 2019. However, the pandemic-related restrictions on the economy and increased government spending induced a sharp increase in government debt, which in 2020 increased to 57.4% of GDP. The debt-to-GDP ratio has since then been gradually declining again; it fell to 49.8% in 2022 and is projected to return to pre-pandemic levels in 2023. The relatively healthy pace of economic growth and the Government’s restraint in public finance suggest that debt levels are likely to continue to decline and stay within the EU’s prescribed limits (up to 60% of GDP).</p>
          <p>Unemployment mirrors the other macroeconomic indicators, tracing a consistent decrease over the past two decades. Between 2003 and 2013 unemployment averaged 6%-8%. However, since 2013 the rate of unemployment has declined steadily to a low of 3.9% in 2019. This was partially a direct consequence of the economy’s strong performance, but also a result of the large wave of emigration from Romania to other EU members since 2012-13, when restrictions on Romanians working in the EU were finally lifted. Annual emigration numbers have been increasing over the past 20 years, but quickly accelerated between 2013 and 2017, when annual emigration reached a peak of 242,200. The numbers declined afterwards, especially around 2020-21 amid the COVID-19 pandemic, when the annual emigration rate fell to under 200,000. However, the cumulative effect of this is quite significant and a strong factor in keeping the unemployment rate low.</p>

          <heading>Foreign Trade and Investment</heading>
          <p>At the end of the 1980s Romania was one of the most closed economies in Europe. Since then, the Romanian economy has opened to foreign trade and investment. Growing domestic demand for goods and services and the increasing standard of living have led to consistent growth in imports of foreign goods and services. The country’s balance of trade shows a growing gap between exports and imports over time, with the deficit widening from around €500m. in 2013 to more than €3,500m. in 2022. While exports have increased over that period, their rate of growth was slower than that of imports. Romania’s main exports are machinery and transport equipment, raw materials, and manufactured goods, such as clothes and footwear. Thus, while increasing, Romanian exports are in labour-intensive and relatively low-technology sectors, suggesting that the country is yet to transition to a service and knowledge-exporting trade model. Significant imports include electronics and electronic products, oil and fuels, and nuclear reactors, fuels and parts. </p>
          <p>
      Romania’s principal trading partners are the main European economies: Germany and Italy, along with neighbouring states Hungary and Bulgaria. Türkiye and the People’s Republic of China are the only two non-EU states among Romania’s principal trading partners. Russia is a relatively unimportant trading partner for Romania, unlike for some of the other former communist states. It accounted for about 3% of Romania’s imports in 2021, before the EU’s imposition of sanctions against Russia in 2022, 
      <!--seems to have stayed about the same according to stats...-->
      when this share is likely to have declined. This may partly explain why the Romanian economy has not been as adversely affected by the war in Ukraine and the sanctions on Russia—Romania and Russia did not trade much even before. Particularly important in this respect is Romania’s relative independence from Russian oil and natural gas imports. In 2021 Romania imported about 24% of gas consumed from Russia, a lower proportion than in most other European countries. Only Croatia (16%), France (15%), Belgium (13%) and Estonia (12%) were less vulnerable to Russian cuts in gas supplies than Romania. That Romania produces oil and gas from domestic onshore and offshore fields reduces its dependence on Russian imports and makes it less vulnerable to the adverse effects of economic sanctions and counter-sanctions between Russia and the EU.
    </p>
          <p>In Romania, FDI has substantially increased over the past two decades. FDI inflows accelerated during the early 2000s, after the relative slow opening of the economy in the 1990s. Since 2003 FDI inflows have exceeded US&#160;$2,000m. annually—even in times of economic crisis in 2009-11 and again in 2020. FDI peaked in 2008 at $13,700m. , and again in 2021 at $11,700m. Consecutive governments have implemented investor-friendly policies, aimed to encourage the inflow of foreign capital in Romania. This stance continues to shape government economic policies, although recent governments have become increasingly sceptical towards the FDI-led model of growth. The previous, centre-left Government in 2020 passed legislation to prevent the sale of shares in any publicly owned companies, driven by the need to protect strategic domestic companies from the downturn induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. More recently, in 2022 the Government adopted screening requirements for foreign investors, following EU directives to that end. Although these measures are intended to protect assets critical to national security, they increase the regulatory burden for potential investors and are likely to deter some, especially non-European, investors from entering the Romanian market in the future.</p>

          <gen-section print-style="COLUMN" sllink="SLSDOC" slsdocrf="GEN-SECTREF">
               <heading>Corruption</heading>
               <p>Corruption is one of the main issues adversely affecting the Romanian economy. Weak rule of law and uneven enforcement of the legal and regulatory regimes reduces the predictability for companies, while vested interests in politics mean that the regulatory and policy decisions are often taken to the advantage of specific economic actors, rather than the taxpayer. Finally, bribery and corrupt officials in state and judicial institutions increase costs and delays for businesses, while also creating significant legal and reputational risks. </p>
               <p>Over the past decade the Romanian authorities have increased efforts to address corruption across all levels of government. The powers and resources of anti-corruption bodies have been accordingly strengthened, with a track record of successful investigations and prosecutions against high-ranking officials. These successes of the anti-corruption authorities have gradually led to change in the culture among businesses and officials—however, there is still much need for additional progress. Although small-scale, opportunistic corruption is less frequent, due to changing public expectations from local officials and increased awareness about avoiding corruption, at the higher, political level transparency and accountability have been more difficult to achieve. Politically motivated appointments to leadership positions in publicly owned companies, limited oversight of political party finance and donations, and undue influence over the policy processes remain persistent risks to businesses, and ultimately to the overall economic performance of the country.</p>

          <gen-section print-style="COLUMN" sllink="SLSDOC" slsdocrf="GEN-SECTREF">
               <heading>Demographics</heading>
               <p>As elsewhere in Europe, demographic decline poses a long-term threat to the growth prospects of the Romanian economy. Population growth has notably slowed over the past three decades since the end of communism. The combined effect of declining births and a large wave of emigration to Western Europe after EU accession has led to a difficult demographic environment in the country. In 2021 the country had a population of 19.1m., a decline of more than 4m. since 1990, when it numbered 23.2m. In addition, the fertility rate has declined below the basic rate for a stable population of 2.1 children per woman. In 2020 the fertility rate in Romania was 1.6 children per woman, significantly below that required to maintain the population, and lower than the 1988 rate of 2.3. </p>
               <p>
        As a result, the population is expected to decline further, as falling births are likely to be compounded by continued emigration, mostly of young and relatively high-skilled Romanians who seek better professional and personal prospects in the West. Many of those who emigrate will start families abroad and may not return to Romania, further depressing the number of births in their country of origin. At the macro level, this means that the Romanian workforce is likely to become increasingly older over time, which will lead to an additional set of challenges for the economy. Maintaining growth and fiscal responsibility are likely to be more difficult, with an ever-declining working-age population and a growing share of pensioners and the elderly
        
        . 
      </p>
               <p>Moreover, emigration of the young and educated will undermine the country’s potential for innovation and research, further delaying the transition from labour- and industry-intensive growth to an economy based on innovation and knowledge. The Government already lags behind other EU economies in spending on research and development (R&amp;D). With spending on R&amp;D in Romania amounting to only about 0.5% of GDP in 2022, Romania’s expenditure is significantly below the EU average of 2.2% of GDP and close to the bottom of the EU member states in this respect. Yet, turning the demographic tide is a major challenge, despite governments adopting family-friendly policies, and one that is likely to take consistent government intervention in policies, governance and the economy before a meaningful change takes place.</p>

          <gen-section print-style="COLUMN" sllink="SLSDOC" slsdocrf="GEN-SECTREF">
               <heading>Geopolitical Risk</heading>
               <p>Finally, geopolitical tensions—especially those related to the growing antagonism between Europe and Russia—are also likely to pose obstacles to Romania’s continued economic success. Although the Romanian economy, largely for historical reasons, was not as closely linked to Russia as those of some of its Central and Eastern European neighbours, Romania is likely to be adversely affected by the EU’s deteriorating relationship with Russia and the continuing war in Ukraine. At the immediate level, while Ukraine is at war with Russia disruptions to supply chains across Romania’s border with Ukraine border are likely to persist and negatively affect Romanian businesses. Inflows of refugees and damage to infrastructure are also likely to increase the burden on local and central authorities which are already struggling to provide adequate services to businesses. </p>
               <p>Similarly, disruptions to Russian supplies of natural gas and oil to Europe, and the related potential shortages of power and fuel, will place downward pressure on the industrial and energy-intensive sectors of the economy, which still dominate Romania’s GDP. Moreover, the war in Ukraine will continue to obstruct Romanian trade through the Baltic Sea—Romania’s largest port, Constanţa, is on the Black Sea, where commercial maritime activities have been substantially reduced since the start of the Ukraine war in February 2022. This, in conjunction with the disruption of land supply chains through Ukraine, is likely to pose a serious challenge to the Government in finding alternative trade and supply channels in the short term.</p>
               <p>Beyond the immediate effects, a prolonged economic downturn could lead to political instability, unrest and protests. While Romania has so far experienced little democratic regression and very limited mobilization behind illiberal and authoritarian political projects, the cases of other countries in the region, such as Poland and Hungary, suggest that this is not an entirely unlikely scenario. Maintaining healthy economic growth remains essential to ensuring that democracy consolidates further—a challenge that Romanian governments need to consider as they face an increasingly difficult geopolitical and economic climate.</p>
