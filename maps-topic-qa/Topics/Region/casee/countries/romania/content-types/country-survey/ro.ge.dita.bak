          <p id="RO.GEOG.1">Romania is a republic in South-Eastern Europe; much of the country forms part of the Balkan peninsula. In the south-east of the country there is a coastline of about 250&#160;km (150 miles) along the Black Sea. The southern border is with Bulgaria and the south-western border is with Serbia. Hungary lies to the north-west, Ukraine to the north and Moldova to the north-east. Romania has a total area of 238,397 sq&#160;km (92,046&#160;sq&#160;miles).</p>
          <p id="RO.GEOG.2">The Carpathian Mountains form a horseshoe through central Romania, running south-east from the northern border and then, as the Transylvanian Alps or Southern Carpathians, traversing central Romania from east to west. The Transylvanian Alps rise to over 2,000&#160;m in places, the mountain of Negoiul being the highest point in Romania, at 2,548&#160;m (8,360&#160;ft). South and east of the mountains lie the fertile Romanian Plain, the lowlands of Wallachia (along the Danube) and Moldavia (along the Siret and Prut Rivers, tributaries of the Danube). Most of the southern confines of Romania are marked by the River Danube (Dunărea). However, in the west of the country the Banat region has a land border with Vojvodina, a part of Serbia. The Iron Gates hydroelectric power and navigation system is on the border with Serbia. In the east, before it reaches the Black Sea, the Danube turns north and flows parallel to the coast before entering the sea at the Danube delta, which forms a border with Ukraine. This area between the Danube and the Black Sea, which features Romania’s only land border with Bulgaria, is the Dobrogea (Dobrudzha). The River Prut defines the north-eastern border and divides Romanian Moldavia from the Republic of Moldova. The plateau-land of north-west Romania, across the Carpathians from the plains, is known as Transylvania and was formerly a province of Hungary.</p>

          <heading>Climate</heading>
          <p id="RO.GEOG.3">The climate is continental, with cold, snowy winters and hot summers. Summers are milder and wetter in the mountains, and the Black Sea moderates the winters on the coast. The north and east suffer from drought, if the summer is dry. The average summer temperature is 23°C (73°F) and the winter average is −3°C (27°F). The average annual rainfall for the whole of Romania is 637&#160;mm (25&#160;ins), ranging from 1,000&#160;mm in the mountains to 400&#160;mm in the Danube delta.</p>

          <heading>Population</heading>
          <p id="RO.GEOG.4">The total population of the country at the census of December 2021 was 19,053,815 (compared with 20,121,641 at the 2011 census), giving a population density of 79.9 per sq km. According to the 2021 census, 77.7% of the total population were ethnic Romanians, 5.3% were ethnic Hungarians and 3.0% were Roma (Gypsy). There are also communities of Germans, Ukrainians (Ruthenians), Carpatho-Rusyns and Turks. Romanian is a Romance language, which evolved from the Latin spoken in Central Europe at the time of the Roman Empire, but with many archaic forms and influences from the Slavonic languages, Hungarian, French and Turkish. It is the official language, although Hungarian (Magyar), German and other minority languages are also spoken. At the 2011 census, 86.5% of the population who stated their religious allegiance described themselves as Orthodox (with the Romanian Orthodox Church being the principal jurisdiction), 4.6% as Roman (Latin rite) Catholic, 3.2% as Reformed, and 1.9% Pentecostal. There were also small communities of `Greek’ (Byzantine rite) Catholics, Baptists, and Seventh Day Adventists.</p>
