          <heading>Introduction</heading>
          <p id="ROMANIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P1">Communist rule in Romania ended abruptly in 1989, with the execution of Nicolae Ceauşescu, but in the 1990s there was a protracted and incomplete transition from that social system. A legacy of foreign occupation in preceding centuries, combined with sharp internal divisions—economic, cultural and, above all, ethnic—inhibited the progress of democratization.</p>
          <p id="ROMANIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P2">Romania peacefully acquired its independence during 1856-81, after which it was recognized as a kingdom under a branch of the German Hohenzollern dynasty. Romania’s self-identification as a `Latin’ country meant that it often differentiated itself from its neighbours; it might share the Orthodox religion with its Slav neighbours, but it stayed aloof from most of them, particularly Russia, which was regarded as inimical to Romanian independence. Independence was acquired through the skill of Romanian politicians in dealing with the Western powers, ensuring that Ottoman suzerainty was not substituted by Russian hegemony.</p>
          <p id="ROMANIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P3">With Hungary, Romania was a rare non-Slavic nation-state in the Danubian basin; however, co-operation was thwarted by the debilitating quarrel over Transylvania, part of Romania since 1918, but often under Hungarian rule for centuries. It was only in the 21st century that reconciliation between the two countries appeared to be making cautious progress. Furthermore, it was hardly surprising that recently acquired independence and threats to territorial integrity allowed nationalism to occupy a salient role in political culture.</p>
          <p id="ROMANIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P4">From 1881 to 1938 Romania enjoyed stable constitutional rule. None the less, the inability of a poorly institutionalized state to integrate new territories with large minority populations acquired after 1918 contributed to the collapse of democracy 20 years later. In 1945 Soviet forces in effect occupied the country, and the social system based on private land ownership, under a Western-leaning system of monarchical government, was ruthlessly curtailed.</p>
          <p id="ROMANIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P5">Between 1947 and 1989 the determination of the communist regime to retain absolute control over politics and society, and to oppose any liberal initiatives in economics, prevented the possibility of a democratic transition largely resourced and inspired from within. The West indirectly contributed to the chain of events that led to the violent collapse of the dictatorship of Nicolae Ceauşescu in 1989: while Western countries preferred to overlook systemic human rights abuses until the last years of Ceauşescu’s rule, substantial loans were made available to the dictator. These loans were used to finance ill-conceived industrialization schemes. At considerable cost to his people, Ceauşescu strove to repay these loans by 1990, but in December 1989 popular protests and a coup by subordinate communist officials brought about his downfall.</p>

          <heading>Years of Lost Reform</heading>
          <p id="ROMANIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P6">The state and party bureaucracy supported the former apparatchik, Ion Iliescu, once he appeared capable of defending its privileges in uncertain times. The promise of social protection secured Iliescu’s election as President in May 1990 (he had been declared President in late 1989) and re-election in 1992. Collectivized villagers, elderly citizens and workers in heavy industry found noisy electoral competition unsettling and were more comfortable with socialist paternalism.</p>
          <p id="ROMANIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P7">In 1991 the ruling Frontul Salvării Naţionale (FSN—National Salvation Front) drew up a new Constitution. Pacts between government and opposition to shape the new political institutions, such as had occurred in Poland and Hungary, were absent in Romania. By the early 1990s it was becoming clear that a primary goal of the new regime was to rule out any normalization of conditions along recognizably Western pluralist lines. This involved disabling or deforming those institutions potentially capable of enabling Romania to recover from the profound malformations of the communist era. Under the new constitutional order, weak political, administrative and economic institutions were created. They became a source of wealth and power for an emerging new elite. It had regrouped after 1989, mutated in the face of geopolitical changes, and acquired new adherents from emerging forces, whose interests were connected to the creation of a venal and unrepresentative political system. This strategy ruled out effective government and meant that for long periods the Partidul Democraţiei Sociale in Romãnia (PDSR—Party of Social Democracy of Romania, as the FSN became known) and its successors were unable to stay in office. However, neither could their centre-right rivals establish credibility, given the existence of weak state structures designed to be controlled by informal means.</p>
          <p id="ROMANIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P8">
      President Iliescu ruled on behalf of those who had benefited from the communist-era changes, which had seen property owners dispossessed and a huge bureaucracy created to oversee a socialist state hostile to private initiative. In the 1990s large state subsidies were poured into loss-making industries, whose managers often diverted public resources for their own private benefit. A poorly conceived attempt to create the semblance of a market economy occurred as Romania witnessed the emergence of a new `oligarchy’, largely composed of so-called 
      <i>nomenklatura</i>
       capitalists and mainly found in the privatized retail and service sectors. As early as 1992, those whom the media described as `cardboard millionaires’ were able to use their political connections to divert more than US $2,000m., which they obtained in credits from the largest state bank, BANCOREX, owing to their closeness to the FSN. Such kleptocratic trends, allied to the manipulation of nationalist fears, and attempts to sabotage opposition activity, meant that Romania did not satisfy the criteria set for European Union (EU) membership. Western pressure contributed to Iliescu’s defeat in the 1996 elections. An unwieldy coalition of disparate parties then tried and failed to advance rapidly in the direction of a market-led economy.
    </p>
          <p id="ROMANIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P9">During President Emil Constantinescu’s single term in office (1996-2000) the idea that the acquisition of private influence and wealth determined political involvement began to extend beyond the PDSR. Iliescu’s party was renamed the Partidul Social Democrat (PSD—Social Democratic Party), after he was comfortably re-elected President on 10 December 2000. Romania’s growing alignment with the NATO democracies as they found themselves confronted with security challenges in the Balkans had led to an invitation to commence negotiations on EU membership, which was issued in December 1999. Romania became a full member of NATO in 2004. However, the residual strength of anti-Western feeling had been shown by the success of the extreme nationalist Partidul Romãnia Mare (PRM—Greater Romania Party) in the early 2000s.</p>
          <p id="ROMANIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P10">In order to join the EU by the target date of 2007, Romania was required to reform a heavily politicized and inefficient justice system, reduce state control of the economy, and modernize a chaotic public administration. Unfortunately, the EU had failed to devise a customized strategy for Romania that took into account the problems arising from the nature of its totalitarian legacy. Consequently, the EU found itself outmanoeuvred by resourceful elite players determined to drain externally imposed reforms of as much real content as possible. It was most troubled by the misuse of power at a local level: local PSD politicians widely referred to as `barons’ (a name they acquired following an accumulation of evidence that they exercised almost absolute control in the geographical areas over which they ruled) gained notoriety after 2001. The regions they governed were among the poorest in the country, where the PSD (and its predecessors) had never effectively been challenged. There was particular concern about the ability of regional `barons’ to divert EU funds intended to improve infrastructure. In 2004 the EU considered suspending negotiations. However, renewed pledges by Prime Minister Adrian Năstase on reforms, especially in the justice sector, convinced EU officials to suppress their misgivings.</p>
          <p id="ROMANIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P11">Năstase was unable to succeed Iliescu as President. He presided over a low-wage, high-tax economy in which purchasing power had fallen by nearly 50% since 1990. The main challenger, Traian Băsescu, the Mayor of Bucharest, was narrowly elected President on 12 December 2004 at the head of a variegated alliance. Despite the participation of the Partidul Naţional Liberal (PNL—National Liberal Party) in this alliance, wealthy liberals who had prospered from deals with PSD figures viewed the emergence of Băsescu with dismay, particularly when he made corruption the focus of his energetic campaign. His candour during a televised confrontation with Năstase convinced voters of his honesty with regard to his own past as an oil tanker captain whose career had flourished during the communist era.</p>

     <gen-section print-style="COLUMN" sllink="SLSDOC" slsdocrf="GEN-SECTREF">
          <heading>Political Reorganization Under Băsescu</heading>
          <p id="ROMANIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P13">In parliamentary elections held on 28 November 2004, the PSD and its rivals were virtually deadlocked. Băsescu nominated a Government led by his parliamentary allies, but it could obtain a majority only by including two parties that had previously been aligned with the PSD. The Government even briefly included the Partidul Conservator (PC—Conservative Party), whose influence derived from its widely viewed television channels, and whose leader, Dan Voiculescu, had accumulated a fortune working for Ceauşescu in the secretive area of foreign trade. His party had a minimal following but demanded, and often received, preferential treatment from the major parties on account of Voiculescu’s media influence.</p>
          <p id="ROMANIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P14">Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu, a wealthy automobile trader and the newly appointed PNL President, became Prime Minister on 28 December 2004. Although in the final days of the Năstase Government negotiations on Romania’s EU membership had been concluded, the EU subsequently insisted that a number of additional reforms be carried out in the areas of competition policy and justice. EU officials would also continue to monitor the justice system and anti-corruption efforts, even after entry was finalized in 2007. Crucially, the EU supported the operations of the National Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office, later the Direcţia Naţională Anticorupţie (DNA—National Anti-Corruption Directorate), which had been established to target elite-level corruption, in response to vocal EU concerns.</p>
          <p id="ROMANIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P15">Alarm grew across the political elite that the reforms being implemented by Minister of Justice Monica Macovei could result in the prosecution of further high-ranking figures, and threatened to disrupt tacitly accepted arrangements whereby politicians enjoyed discreet oversight over the justice system and immunity from some of its laws. Macovei had to fight constant battles with the judicial structures that had been created by the PSD and its associates. The PSD claimed that her interventions violated the revised Constitution of 2003, which, for the first time in post-1945 Romania, decreed that the judiciary was separate from the executive. Supporters of Macovei, who included the European Commission and a new generation of judges and prosecutors, argued that the Government had to take exceptional measures in response to the pervasiveness of corruption.</p>
          <p id="ROMANIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P16">Băsescu sought to be an active President and abandoned Iliescu’s approach of arbitrating between elite interests while neglecting meaningful change. He combined support for strong anti-corruption policies domestically with a firm pro-Western orientation. In December 2005 a 10-year agreement was signed in Washington, DC, USA, on the establishment of US military bases in Romania.</p>

          <heading>Constitutional Crisis</heading>
          <p id="ROMANIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P21">Disunity on the centre-right enabled the leader of the PSD, Victor Ponta, to form a new Government in May 2012. However, it soon became engaged in a power struggle with Băsescu, which intensified in subsequent months, involving the EU and Germany’s Chancellor, Angela Merkel. The prison sentences imposed on powerful politicians and a number of business figures suspected of high-level corruption, who included former Prime Minister Năstase, precipitated a further attempt to drive him from office. The anti-constitutional methods used led to the intervention of EU and US officials. After they declared that the means being used to remove Băsescu were `unacceptable’, the crisis was defused and on 21 August the Constitutional Court voted to reinstate the President.</p>
          <p id="ROMANIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P22">On 9 December 2012 parliamentary elections were held. They were won by the Uniunea Social Liberală (USL—Social-Liberal Union), an alliance of the PSD, the PC and anti-reformists in the PNL. With a voter turnout of only 41.8%, the USL secured 58.6% of the votes cast and 273 of the 412 seats in the Chamber of Deputies. The new Parliament was dominated by local figures, who often had little interest in assuming governing responsibilities but who, in many cases, were aware of the opportunities of benefiting personally from political power. Owing to the substantial emigration of economically active citizens, the electorate was increasingly elderly, poor and badly educated, and much under the influence of anti-reform television stations. National issues were absent from the campaign.</p>
          <p id="ROMANIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P23">The EU’s chief concern was the continuation of the success of the campaign against high-level corruption in Romania. The DNA acquired a new Chief Prosecutor, Laura Codruţa Kövesi, during a brief truce between Băsescu and Ponta in 2013. She proved an energetic and controversial head of the anti-corruption prosecuting agency, which, in its annual reports for 2016, 2017 and 2018, listed a total of 2,823 indicted individuals, including seven government ministers, 17 legislative deputies, seven senators, 72 mayors, 20 magistrates and lawyers, as well as 38 national company directors. A significant number of those sentenced were from the PSD, although members of other parties were also indicted for cronyism, embezzlement, misuse of office and other corrupt practices.</p>
          <p id="ROMANIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P25">Ponta was expected easily to win the presidential election in November 2014, and he staged an ostentatious presidential campaign, although he failed to take into account the influence of the diaspora community. The turnout in the second round of voting, was 64.1%, the highest level of voter participation in any election since 2000. Klaus Iohannis, the main opposition contender, won a largely unexpected victory, with 54.4% of the votes cast. Strong support from Romania’s rapidly expanding overseas diaspora contributed to his success. Expectations were initially high that Iohannis would use the presidential authority invested by the Constitution to promote political renewal. However, it was from among the largely anti-reform PNL that President Iohannis selected his senior advisers, who encouraged him to refrain from challenging the PSD.</p>

          <heading>The Era of Liviu Dragnea</heading>
          <p>Ponta tendered his resignation as Chairman of the PSD in July 2015, owing to a criminal indictment brought against him by the DNA. He was replaced by Liviu Dragnea, who became the dominant figure in the party when Ponta announced his resignation as Prime Minister on 4 November. It had been prompted by the state’s mismanagement of investigations into a nightclub fire in late October, in which some 64 people died, precipitating mass anti-Government demonstrations in Bucharest and other cities. A technocratic government, led by Dacian Cioloş, then ruled for a year, but was unable to dislodge anti-reform interests, despite proclaimed good intentions.</p>
          <p id="ROMANIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P27">As widely predicted, the PSD obtained the majority of seats in both parliamentary chambers in elections held on 11 December 2016. Its only significant challengers (respectively, the second- and third-placed parties) were the much weakened PNL and the Uniunea Salvaţi Romănia (USR—Save Romania Union), a new civic force committed to political renewal and supported by an urban middle-class with rising expectations. However, large numbers of voters who felt abandoned or exploited by an embedded political class abstained, owing to the lack of an alternative choice.</p>
          <p id="ROMANIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P28">Romania continued to be challenged by demographic decline and relied on EU funding for economic development and important expenditure. Moreover, an EU report published in March 2015 found Romania’s absorption of EU funds to be 20% lower than the average for the accession countries. The large-scale emigration of professionals was undiminished and the economy continued to be based on consumption rather than on the production of goods and services. Much of the media continued to be controlled by the PSD and overall the reform camp was weak in a country where establishing a new party was an expensive and highly bureaucratic process. According to a poll released in May 2017, around three-quarters of Romanians believed that the country was heading in the wrong direction as a result of corruption, and 85% viewed Parliament as the institution that was the chief source of the problem. Under Dragnea, the parliamentary majority would attempt to force the adoption of immunity laws that would exclude deputies and senators from prosecution for bribery, misuse of office and conflict of interest.</p>
          <p id="ROMANIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P29">The PSD’s campaign had involved offering material rewards to an electorate which, outside a few main cities, generally subsisted on low incomes. With an effective patronage system, the PSD was best placed to offer short-term inducements to the electorate. The results of the December 2016 elections allowed PSD leader Dragnea to select the next head of government, but he was unable to hold the premiership himself following a suspended jail sentence for electoral fraud the previous year, owing to a law which banned convicted persons from holding high office. He nominated four Prime Ministers during the 12 months from the PSD election victory: the President rejected the first candidate, and the following two clashed with Dragnea because of their refusal to comply with his wishes.</p>
          <p id="ROMANIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P30">On 4 January 2017 Sorin Mihai Grindeanu took office as Prime Minister. Dragnea then decided to act rapidly, using the PSD’s parliamentary majority, to decriminalize corruption offences, and to secure the adoption of a wide-ranging amnesty on the pretext that prisons were severely overcrowded. These proposed measures would potentially enable numerous PSD figures to resume political careers, including Dragnea, who would no longer be barred from becoming Prime Minister because of his criminal record. However, unexpected resistance from the President threw the PSD’s plans into disarray. On 18 January Iohannis used his authority to preside at a cabinet meeting which had been due to agree on ordinances that would drastically affect the penal code. Increasingly large demonstrations were staged in Bucharest in opposition to Dragnea’s measures, and quickly spread to many provincial cities, dominated by middle-class professionals who had benefited from curbs on widespread corruption.</p>
          <p id="ROMANIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P31">On 22 January 2017 Dragnea misjudged the atmosphere domestically and abroad when he argued that President Iohannis was orchestrating protests along with the intelligence services, and that he was involved in inciting a coup. When the amnesty and decriminalization ordinances were, none the less, activated by the Grindeanu Government on 31 January, the US embassy in Bucharest, together with five other NATO missions, issued an unusually categorical statement in which they warned that Romania’s relationship with the West was at risk.</p>
          <p id="ROMANIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P32">Despite harsh winter conditions, nightly mass protests continued nationwide, expressing commitment to democracy and to a Euro-Atlantic order threatened by dissension and policy retreats. Grindeanu refused to endorse Dragnea’s view that the protesters were preparing a coup against the Government. On 2 February 2017 the Prime Minister, apparently of his own accord, announced that the ordinances were to be withdrawn, but he was removed from office, at Dragnea’s command, in May.</p>
          <p id="ROMANIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P33">The new Prime Minister, Mihai Tudose, hitherto Minister of the Economy, took office on 29 June 2017. Dragnea’s continued practice of controlling the Government from behind the scenes led to fresh acrimony, as he imposed pay rises, tax cuts and fresh subsidies in order to benefit the party’s core, mainly lower-income supporters. Ministers found it increasingly difficult to justify these measures to a heavily taxed middle class or to the European Commission, which noted a sharp rise in the budget deficit. Populist spending measures were also financed by cuts to the country’s already neglected infrastructure.</p>
          <p id="ROMANIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P34">After seeking to curb Dragnea’s interference, Tudose, in turn, was obliged to resign in January 2018. His successor, Viorica Dăncilă, became Romania’s first female Prime Minister; she was perceived as being completely subordinate to her party leader. Shortly after her appointment, the adoption of amendments to judicial law, widely perceived as being intended to bring judges, prosecutors and the courts under the control of the Ministry of Justice, prompted large public demonstrations. Measures were also approved that would make it much harder to pursue the prosecution of members of the elite on corruption charges. Any abuse of office leading to financial damages of less than €200,000 would not be deemed a criminal matter, the use of sexual favours would be decriminalized, and sentences of less than three years for corruption could be served as a form of house arrest. It was no surprise when the European Commission issued a report in May 2018 in which it expressed concern about a sharp rise in corruption throughout Romania’s state sector and pressure on judges to overlook it. As preparations were made for Romania to hold the Presidency of the Council of the EU in the first half of 2019 Eurocrats grew apprehensive about the escalating tensions between the Government and President Iohannis. The Government, with the help of a Constitutional Court dominated by PSD supporters, was now eroding many of the President’s powers. A sharp dispute arose in 2018 between Iohannis and Minister of Justice Tudorel Toader, over whether the DNA Chief Prosecutor, Kövesi, should remain in office. In February Toader requested her dismissal, apparently antagonized by her readiness to state to foreign media outlets that the rule of law was under threat. In May the Constitutional Court ruled that he was obliged to dismiss her.</p>

          <heading>The Downfall of Dragnea</heading>
          <p id="ROMANIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P35">
      An attempt to pardon Dragnea for past offences sparked large public protests in mid-2018. On 10 August an Austrian television crew and an Israeli journalist were beaten by riot police, after the Minister of the Interior ordered the suppression of a large protest meeting in Bucharest. Over 100 people were injured, prompting a warning by commentators in the United Kingdom-based 
      <i>Financial Times</i>
       newspaper in mid-August that Romania was repudiating European values shortly before it was due to assume the Presidency of the Council of the EU. The Mayor of Bucharest, Gabriela Firea (of the PSD), demanded an explanation for the way in which the Government had handled the protest. She soon found herself under attack for disloyalty as a series of purges forced out some of Dragnea’s main internal critics. However, he suffered humiliation when a referendum, held on 6-7 October, proposing constitutional amendments supporting the `traditional family’ failed, with the voter turnout far below the 30% required for the outcome to be valid. Meanwhile, on 21 June Romania’s Supreme Court had found Dragnea guilty and sentenced him to three-and-a-half years in prison for abuse of office. Prime Minister Dăncilă unexpectedly defied Dragnea as he attempted to force through the controversial legislation that would decriminalize corruption thus enabling him to become Prime Minister. On 22 September she told party members that Romania was at danger of having its EU voting rights removed should such an amnesty be implemented.
    </p>
          <p id="ROMANIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P36">Dragnea publicly denounced the role of interfering outside figures, among whom he included Hungarian-US financier George Soros, protesting that the anti-corruption campaign was an attack on Romania itself, organized and financed from abroad. However, this conspiracy claim failed to convince public opinion domestically, as polls showed a decline in his popularity. There was outrage well beyond Romania when, in March 2019, the authorities indicted former DNA head Kövesi on corruption charges, banning her from giving media interviews or leaving the country. This was widely interpreted as a desperate move to prevent her from becoming the EU’s European Public Prosecutor—a new post to which she was in the event appointed in January 2020.</p>
          <p id="ROMANIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P37">Domestic political conflict was absorbing the energies of the Government, as an ill-prepared Romania assumed the Presidency of the Council of the EU in January 2019. In general, the occupancy of this office by a post-communist country had been regarded as a milestone in its democratic transition, and as an opportunity for it to display its achievements and goals as an EU member. However, under Dăncilă, an inexperienced Prime Minister with little real authority, it was clear that Romania would have little more than a ceremonial role. The additional focus on Romania exposed the fact that many of the national President’s powers had been removed, and control of bodies such as the Constitutional Court had been seized by the ruling party, and there were frantic attempts to cover up or excuse corruption by a feuding leadership. Reformers in Romania sought to draw attention to what were interpreted as ongoing efforts to place the justice system under tight political control.</p>
          <p id="ROMANIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P38">The PSD’s isolation was highlighted by its suspension in April 2019 from the Party of European Socialists (PES), the main left-wing political group in the European Parliament, as its membership shortly before elections to the Parliament on 26 May was considered damaging for the PES. In Romania a non-binding referendum was scheduled for the same day on proposals to prohibit amnesties and pardons for corruption offences, and approval by the Government of emergency ordinances concerning the judiciary and extension of the right to appeal against them. Calling such a referendum was one of the few remaining powers of President Iohannis, and was regarded as a way of challenging the ruling party’s record on corruption and rule of law issues. Less than six months before the next presidential election was due, Iohannis’s credibility was strengthened when the proposals were supported by around 85% of voters, with a turnout of about 41%, comfortably above the 30% threshold for the vote to be valid.</p>
          <p id="ROMANIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P39">In the 2019 European Parliament elections, meanwhile, the PSD suffered a resounding defeat, obtaining only 22.5% of the votes. This was largely attributed to a participation rate of about 51%, higher than in the last two general elections. The votes of the large diaspora population contributed to a victory for the PNL, with 27.0% of the votes cast; a progressive alliance of the USR and the new Partidul Libertate, Unitate şi Solidaritate (PLUS—Freedom, Unity and Soldarity Party—led by former Prime Minister Cioloş), the Alianţa USR PLUS, received 22.4%, only narrowly behind the PSD, which obtained 22.5%.</p>
          <p id="ROMANIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P40">This electoral shock was quickly superseded by even more dramatic developments the following day. On 27 May 2019 the High Court of Cassation and Justice rejected the appeal lodged by Dragnea over his conviction for corruption in June 2018. The leader of the PSD surrendered to police a few hours later and began his three-and-a-half-year prison sentence.</p>

     <gen-section print-style="COLUMN" sllink="SLSDOC" slsdocrf="GEN-SECTREF">
          <heading>Political Vacuum Opens Up</heading>
          <p id="ROMANIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P41">Dragnea’s protegé, Dăncilă, subsequently struggled to fill the political vacuum. At the end of June 2019 a PSD congress elected her as party leader, and on 24 August she was officially nominated as the PSD’s candidate for the forthcoming presidential election. Time was running out, however. Unimpressed by her management of Romania’s Presidency of the Council of the EU during the first half of the year, the European Commission harshly criticized her Government’s economic record in a report released on 5 June. Pensions rises and other populist measures designed to strengthen support for the PSD among poorer citizens were described as highly imprudent. Dăncilă attempted to mollify the EU by promising to abandon the proposed changes to the criminal code that would enable convicted members of the political elite to make an early return to active politics. While projecting herself as a symbol of moderation and balance nationally, within her own party she continued Dragnea’s practice of expelling or marginalizing senior figures who challenged her direction. However, high-level defections meant that she rapidly lost ground, and the initiative now swung towards President Iohannis, who soon made it clear that his goal was to schedule early parliamentary elections and to reduce the PSD’s advantage in municipal politics by restoring a two-round system in the local elections due to take place in June 2020. However, enforcement of his authority was not straightforward. Under the Constitution, early elections were only permitted after Parliament had rejected two consecutive nominations for the office of Prime Minister. Moreover, the PNL (led by Iohannis prior to his inauguration as national President) and its smaller but assertive ally, the USR, were in conflict over tactics and broader political strategy. When Dăncilă’s Government was finally removed in a parliamentary vote of no confidence on 10 October 2019, the PNL was to establish a replacement administration without the USR. The PNL leader, Ludovic Orban, was invited to form a new Government, which obtained a narrow parliamentary vote of confidence in November.</p>
          <p id="ROMANIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P42">By this time, the campaign for the presidential election was fully under way. Unlike previous contests, the result of this one appeared to be a foregone conclusion. The only question seemed to be whether Iohannis would be elected with over 50% of the votes on 10 November 2019, thereby rendering a second round unnecessary. In the event, he fell short, with 37.8% of the votes cast, and he proceeded to the run-off poll with Dăncilă, the second-placed candidate, on 24 November. Controversially, he refused to hold any televised debates with her and chose instead to have a series of interviews with figures from the media and civil society who were unlikely to put him under pressure. His rival waged a strenuous campaign, but it was clear that she was unable to mobilize the PSD electoral machine, except in its southern strongholds. Pensioners and other social groups previously loyal to the PSD deserted in large numbers. Many doubted the sustainability of its social protection measures given the large and growing balance-of-payments deficit. There was also almost nationwide weariness with the inefficiency and corruption that had marked PSD rule. Dăncilă obtained only 33.9% of the votes, the lowest share ever received by a PSD presidential candidate, and Iohannis was re-elected for a second and final term with an overwhelming endorsement, having obtained 66.1% of the votes.</p>
          <p id="ROMANIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P43">However, it proved far from easy for Iohannis to consolidate his victory. Predictions that the PSD would dissolve into hopeless factionalism were confounded. Dăncilă was deposed as PSD leader shortly after her electoral defeat by a party veteran and Chairman of the Chamber of Deputies, Ion-Marcel Ciolacu, who succeeded in restoring discipline and preventing the minority PNL Government from reversing major laws that had been primarily of benefit to the PSD and its clients. Prime Minister Orban was defeated in a parliamentary motion of no confidence in February 2020 and the erstwhile Minister of Public Finance, Florian-Vasile Cîţu, was invited by Iohannis to form a new government. Cîţu was a staunch opponent of the PSD, unlike other members of the PNL who in the past had shared power with the former communists. It seemed unlikely that the PSD would allow him to take office, and if he lost a vote of confidence it would enable the President to schedule new parliamentary elections. However, on 12 March Cîţu shocked many by renouncing his candidacy. His explanation was that, with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the political situation had changed: the necessary conditions or consensus to hold early elections no longer existed, and it was preferable for Orban to continue in office.</p>
          <p id="ROMANIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P44">The previously intense political activity noticeably decreased during the pandemic. By mid-May 2020 more than 1,000 people had died in the country, owing to COVID-19, and the north-eastern county of Suceava was particularly badly affected. The most noteworthy political development was the unanimous decision of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) on 5 May that Kövesi, who had secured the new EU post of European Public Prosecutor, had been unfairly dismissed from her former position as Chief Prosecutor of the DNA. Kövesi had become a heroine for urban and better-educated Romanians opposed to the agenda of Dragnea and the PSD. Her success in filling an important new EU position, one symbolizing the acceleration of integration, for many epitomized the growing Europeanization of the country. However, the temptation to exploit nationalist insecurities appeared in unexpected quarters.</p>
          <p id="ROMANIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P45">Meanwhile, in April 2020 Iohannis caused consternation when he accused the PSD of seeking to promote autonomy for Hungarian-majority counties in Transylvania, in association with Hungarian nationalists. He failed to offer evidence for his claim, and soon afterwards the Hungarian Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, posted on social networking website Facebook a pre-1920 map of Hungary which incorporated into Hungary territories subsequently transferred to Romania. In early May 2020 László Tőkés, an ethnic Hungarian pastor and politician who had played a prominent role in the events leading to the collapse of communism in Romania in 1989, accused Iohannis of inciting ethnic hatred and a complaint was lodged against the President at the Supreme Court, which the state authorities proceeded to investigate. Ironically, one of the main charges that Iohannis had previously levelled against the PSD was that it had fuelled fears about Hungarian irredentism in order to divert attention from its own failings. The Government had admitted that it was struggling to respond effectively to the pandemic because of a badly under-resourced health care service, and there were concerns that when Romanians voted in national elections at the end of 2020 the ruling PNL, and not the PSD, would receive much of the blame for such mismanagement. Hence, Iohannis’s controversial intervention was interpreted as a pre-emptive move to prevent his main rival from exploiting nationalist sentiments, as it had so often done in the past.</p>
          <p id="ROMANIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P47">Meanwhile, fully absorbed by the health emergency, the PNL Government has been in a poor position to halt illegal logging. In February 2020 the European Commission warned Romania that unless urgent action was taken to reduce deforestation of the Eastern Carpathian mountain range traversing the country, it could face heavy sanctions from the EU. Meanwhile, at least during the first month of the pandemic, the Romanian state impressed many by issuing over 200,000 fines for violations of the national lockdown, thereby obtaining revenue equivalent to the country’s corporate tax takings in February.</p>
          <p id="ROMANIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P48">The pandemic coincided with a busy electoral calendar, and the Government decided to proceed with local elections on 28 September 2020 and legislative polls in December. Contesting the election with the support of the PNL and the Alianţa USR PLUS, Nicuşor Dan, a well-known civic activist and mathematician, won an unexpected victory to become the Mayor of Bucharest, and the centre-right performed well in other cities, as a result of strong anti-PSD sentiment, especially among voters aged between 18 and 45 years old.</p>
          <p id="ROMANIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P49">The parliamentary elections of 6 December 2020 took place against a background of an increasing number of COVID-19 infections and fatalities, tighter social restrictions and deepening austerity as the Government announced its intention to abandon an increase in the state pension of 40% that had been announced by its predecessor. Real GDP contracted by 3.7% in 2020 and only limited social safety measures were in place for citizens who were unable to work or who had lost their jobs as a result of restrictions imposed on the economy in order to contain the pandemic</p>
          <p id="ROMANIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P50">The turnout at the legislative elections was even lower than in the local elections, at just 31.9%. The PSD, despite a low level of popularity with the public in the run-up to the poll, emerged once again as the largest party with 28.9% of the votes and 110 seats in the Chamber of Deputies. The parties supporting the Government performed less well than expected. A newly formed nationalist and xenophobic party, the Alianţia Pentru Unirea Romãnilor (AUR—Gold—Alliance for the Unity of Romanians), which has questioned Romanian membership of NATO and fuelled anti-vaccination sentiment (with regard to COVID-19) among rural and small-town voters, took 9.1% of the votes and 33 seats (despite having won under 1% of the votes in the recent local elections). Its leader, Gheorghe Simion, launched the party’s campaign in London, United Kingdom, proclaiming the AUR as the party of the 3m.-strong Romanian diaspora. The PNL won 25.2% of the votes and 93 seats, and the Alianţa USR PLUS took 15.4% of the votes and 55 seats.</p>
          <p id="ROMANIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P51">Orban resigned as Prime Minister on 7 December 2020, and shortly afterwards (in his capacity as leader of the PNL) proposed Cîţu for the post. Later in that month the PNL, USR PLUS and the Romániai Magyar Demokrata Szövetség (Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania), which together held a narrow majority of 169 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, announced that they had reached a coalition agreement. On 22 December Cîţu was officially nominated as Prime Minister-designate by President Iohannis and, with the support of the coalition parties, Orban was elected as Chairman of the Chamber of Deputies, thereby retaining his influence within the PNL and beyond. A new Government, led by Cîţu, was approved by 260 of 455 votes cast in Parliament on the following day. </p>

          <heading>Absence of Reform Progress</heading>
          <p>Due to a poorly functioning health care service, Romania struggled to cope with the severity of a renewed COVID-19 outbreak in early 2021. Unfortunately, the new Government was unable to put aside divisions between its two main parties, as well as personal rivalries within both these parties, to govern effectively. The release of funds from the EU’s Recovery and Resilience Facility intended to revive economies damaged by the pandemic crisis was awaited in Romania. Although the European Commission was determined that much of the funds would be used to prioritize green investments and digitalization, Romania wished to use its allocation of funds to modernize an outdated transport system, as well as its gas distribution infrastructure.</p>
          <p>Changes in political affiliation have been a recurring feature of the Romanian political world since a democratic system was formed in 1990. Perhaps the most quixotic, as well as momentous, defection occurred in 2021-22 when President Iohannis decided to abandon the side of political reform. Many were astonished when he oversaw a pact between his own PNL and the former communist PSD. In 2019 Iohannis had successfully sought re-election on a vehemently anti-PSD platform, refusing even to debate with its challenger. An electoral pact with USR PLUS was formed in 2020. However, in 2021 this alliance disintegrated, and by the end of that year the PNL had formed a Government with its principal rival and effectively embraced its anti-reform agenda.</p>
          <p>Polls show that President Iohannis’s previously high popularity has collapsed but he has achieved a level of political control that he hopes will enable him to serve the rest of his term of office smoothly. Following the removal of two PNL Prime Ministers in quick succession during 2020-21, Iohannis’s third nominee for the position, Minister of National Defence Gen. (retd) Nicolae-Ionel Ciucă, was considered a pliable figure very much under the influence of Iohannis. Clearly (due to numerous PNL defections and the new hostility in 2021 of USR PLUS) Ciucă’s Government could only survive with the support of the PSD, the largest parliamentary force. On 25 November 2021 a coalition power-sharing agreement was reached, under which the premiership would pass to Ciolacu, the leader of the PSD, in early 2023. It was clear from the important portfolios obtained by the PSD that it was the most cohesive and influential force in the Government. The PNL, weakened by divisions, became resigned to being an accessory to a cynical agreement between the President and his former chief enemy. The political direction soon became clear when anti-reformers secured the advantage in the longstanding struggle to ensure that prosecutors and judges were able to bring to account senior figures who abused their positions for political gain. Cristi Danileţ and Camelia Bogdan, perhaps the two best-known judges committed to opposing high-level corruption, were expelled from the judiciary on dubious grounds in December 2021 and April 2022, respectively. (Danileţ was reinstated by the High Court of Cassation and Justice in December 2022, after a successful appeal). Iohannis, despite carefully cultivating an image elsewhere in the EU as a defender of judicial independence, took no action. He also remained immovable over the appointment of a criminal lawyer from the PSD who had defended numerous political and organized crime figures to head an important parliamentary justice committee.</p>
          <p>Disenchantment with Iohannis was increasingly widespread, leading to a drop in his poll ratings. It was soon noted by observers that many of the major figures holding office under Iohannis were, like Ciucă himself, graduates of the National Defence College. In January 2022 investigative journalist Emilia Şercan presented evidence that she claimed provided conclusive proof that the Prime Minister had plagiarized his 2003 doctoral thesis. She had already made similar allegations against other prominent figures, who had been required to leave their positions. International media bodies defending media freedoms reacted with alarm when she became the subject of threats and intimidation. Ciucă himself eventually intervened to condemn the harassment and promise that the perpetrators would be sought. General suspicions were focused on the intelligence services, which are overseen by Iohannis and which had their powers expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020-22. Notably, a new emergency ordinance passed in April 2022 granted the intelligence services the authority to decide if applications by non-EU investors planning investments of €2m. or more in Romania would be allowed to proceed.</p>
          <p>
      Some observers warn that such powers might be used arbitrarily, fearing that Romania is becoming a militarized democracy as the power and standing of the parties and civic forces decline. On 10 April 2022 Ciucă became leader of the PNL, despite having no previous record of participation in the party’s affairs. The party’s opinion poll ratings have subsequently slumped. The rotation of the premiership from Ciucă to Ciolacu under the November 2021 coalition agreement, which had been planned for 26 May 2023, was postponed until mid-June, due to escalating strikes and anti-Government demonstrations by teachers.
      <!--not sure what this refers to, no ministers replaced in 2023?-->
      The shrinking of political competition and the difficulty of holding a Government with a large parliamentary majority to account continues to receive scant attention from broadcasters. During the 2020-22 pandemic the media in general received vast subsidies from the Government which, some observers believe, has caused electronic and print outlets to align with the government agenda in ways not seen since the early 1990s. As a result, investigations into troubling features of the political and economic power structures have been suspended, causing disquiet in the US and European bodies monitoring media freedom.
    </p>
          <p>
      In theory, by 2027 Romania is due to receive up to €80,000m. in EU funding, 
      <!--don’t think this is true?-->
      under the European Commission’s Recovery and Resilience Facility and the new Multiannual Financial Framework for 2021-27. However, governmental inefficiency and the inability of the coalition partners to agree on how to reform the pension system has delayed the release of funding. An end to the practice of using public money to reward clients and allies entrusted with sensitive state roles with massive pensions is one of the conditions imposed by the European Commission for the release of funds. Romania’s credibility was damaged when in April 2023 it announced the intention to request the European Commission to reopen negotiations on its National Recovery and Resilience Plan.
    </p>
          <p>The depoliticized atmosphere has been intermittently disturbed by provocations staged by the extremist AUR, which has consolidated its second place in opinion polls, ahead of the PNL. On 21 December 2021 a large group of the party’s supporters tried to force their way into Parliament, damaging vehicles belonging to diplomats. Widely regarded as being under strong Russian influence, an expected decline in AUR’s popularity after the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 did not occur. Romania’s location gives it a vital geostrategic position in the conflict. Not only does it border Ukraine to the north, but it also has a long frontier with Moldova, which has been threatened by Russia. To deflect attention from its failings, the Government regularly blames inflation and other economic woes on the war in Ukraine. This has fuelled a strong feeling of disengagement towards the conflict among lower-income citizens in particular, who favour an early compromise peace between the two warring sides and are reluctant for Romania to become deeply involved in the conflict. An opinion poll in May 2023 showed strong opposition to the suggestion that Romania come to the aid of neighbouring Moldova, where a large share of the population holds Romanian citizenship, if Russia launched military action against it. Declining support for the EU and NATO in Romania is widely viewed as due to the strong Euro-Atlantic support for Ukraine in the conflict. Unlike other leaders in the region, Iohannis has kept a low profile over the conflict, even though Romania has quietly supplied military aid to Ukraine. Much of the Romanian political class shares the fears of counterparts in France and Germany that a militarily successful Ukraine able to join NATO relatively soon, and also in line for EU membership, would shift the balance of power in the EU towards Poland and eventually Ukraine itself. Although Russia historically has been a foe of Romanian independence, the fear that a dynamic Ukraine would result in EU assistance being withdrawn from an unreformed Romania is a much greater consideration in Bucharest. </p>
          <p>Romania’s lack of standing within the EU was revealed in late 2022 when, due to a veto by Austria, it was unexpectedly denied entry to the EU’s Schengen area. Iohannis denounced the decision and acrimony with the Austrian Government over the issue continued in 2023. Some within the Romanian Government demanded that Austria’s commercial role in the extraction of considerable oil deposits located off Romania’s Black Sea coast be cut in response. </p>
          <p>Romania’s labour market and the size of its economy have grown, in part due to the relocation of foreign investment from Ukraine to safer neighbouring havens. However, Romania struggles to take advantage of such opportunities. Strains within the ruling coalition grew in 2023, due to the fast expanding budget deficit and the failure to reach agreement on where spending cuts should be imposed. Romania is unable to absorb EU funds at a rate anywhere near that of Poland or Hungary, and much of the bureaucracy still lacks the ability to devise projects that comply with EU guidelines. Huge savings could be made if the 41 Romanian counties, each with an extended bureaucracy which includes large inspectorates for police, education, culture and sport, were reduced to 10-15 units of territorial administration. It has been estimated that digitalization of certain parts of the bureaucracy could reduce spending by one-half. Despite such measures being capable of relieving the state budget of a significant burden, support for modernization efforts is weak at the heart of the political system. Politicians refuse to combat waste and inefficiency if it reduces their powers of patronage within the system of government.</p>
          <p>
      However, there was widespread satisfaction within Romania’s political class when, after 15 years, the European Commission recommended in November 2022 that its close monitoring of the justice system under the Co-operation and Verification Mechanism (CVM) be discontinued. The Commission had already in 2019 requested the lifting of its CVM monitoring the justice system in Bulgaria, but the mechanism formally remained in place, owing to new EU concerns about the inability of that country’s justice system to address high-level corruption. The ongoing weakness of pro-reform forces in Romanian politics and the general inefficiency of public services are likely to reinforce continuing EU vigilance of some of the country’s principal
      
       public institutions for the foreseeable future.
