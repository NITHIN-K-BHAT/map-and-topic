                    <p id="RO.DIR.3">Following its assumption of power in December 1989, the National Salvation Front decreed radical changes to the Constitution of 1965. The name of the country was changed from the Socialist Republic of Romania to Romania. The leading role of a single political party was abolished, a democratic and pluralist system of government being established.</p>
                    <p id="RO.DIR.4">The combined chambers of the legislature elected in May 1990, working as a constituent assembly, drafted a new Constitution (based on the Constitution of France’s Fifth Republic), which was approved in a national referendum on 8 December 1991. A plebiscite held on 18-19 October 2003 approved 79 amendments to the Constitution, bringing it into conformity with EU legislation. The amendments entered into force on 29 October.</p>
                    <p id="RO.DIR.5">Under the amended Constitution, political power in Romania belongs to the people and is exercised according to the principles of demo­cracy, freedom, human dignity, and the inviolability and inalienability of basic human rights. Romania is governed on the basis of a multi-party democratic system and of the separation of the legal, executive and judicial powers. Romania’s legislature, comprising the Chamber of Deputies (Camera Deputaţilor, the lower house) and the Senate (Senatul), is elected by universal, free, direct and secret vote for a term of four years. The President is directly elected for a term of four years, and may serve a maximum of two terms. Citizens have the right to vote at the age of 18 years, and may be elected at the age of 21 to the Chamber of Deputies and at the age of 30 to the Senate, with no upper age limit in either case. Those ineligible for election include former members of the Securitate (the secret police of former President Nicolae Ceauşescu) and other former officials guilty of repression and abuses. Once elected, the President may not remain a member of any political party. The President appoints the Prime Minister, who in turn appoints the Council of Ministers.</p>
