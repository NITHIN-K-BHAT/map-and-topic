          <p id="RS.GEOG.1">The Republic of Serbia is situated in the central Balkan Peninsula, in South-Eastern Europe. Excluding Kosovo (which declared independence from Serbia in 2008, although this is not formally recognized by the Serbian authorities), Serbia has an area of 77,589 sq km (29,957 sq miles) and is landlocked. There are borders to the south and west with Kosovo, and western borders (from south to north) with Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia, a border with Hungary to the north, with Romania and Bulgaria to the east, and with North Macedonia to the south. Serbia includes the province of Vojvodina (with an area of 21,614 sq&#160;km), in the north.</p>
          <p id="RS.GEOG.2">The River Danube (Dunav) forms part of Serbia’s western border with Croatia and runs across the northern half of the country to form part of the eastern frontier with Romania. The fertile plains of Vojvodina and northern Serbia are also watered by the Tisa (Tisza), Drava and Sava rivers, the last of which flows eastwards from Bosnia and Herzegovina to join the Danube at Belgrade (Beograd). Another river to flow into the Danube on these plains is the Morava, which passes through a deep valley from the mountainous south. Serbia has a rugged mountainous terrain, except in the north where the Pannonian plains begin.</p>

          <p id="RS.GEOG.4">
      At the September 2022 census the total population of Serbia was 6,647,003, and the population density was 85.7 per sq km. The principal language is Serbian (known in the second half of the 20th century as the 
      <i>ekavian</i>
       dialect of Serbo-Croat: this language was formerly written exclusively in the Cyrillic script, but has also begun to appear in the Latin script). At the 2022 census 80.6% of the population of Serbia were ethnic Serbs. The main non-Slavic group in Serbia are Hungarians (2.8% of the population of Serbia, at the 2022
      
       census). The province of Vojvodina, in the north of Serbia, was formerly part of the Banat, a border territory of the Habsburg realm. Although it is an area of very mixed ethnic composition, it formerly had a large Hungarian population. At the 2022 census some 2.3% of the population of Serbia were Bosniaks (Slav Muslims), while 2.0% were Roma; Bosniaks live mainly in the Sandžak region that straddles the Serbian-Montenegrin border, to the north of Kosovo, and around the town of Novi Pazar. Other ethnic groups resident in the country included Croats, Slovaks, Montenegrins and Vlachs.

          <p id="RS.GEOG.5">The principal religion in Serbia is Orthodox Christianity, as represented by the Serbian Orthodox Church. There are followers of other Orthodox rites, some Roman Catholics (in Vojvodina and among the Albanian and Croat minorities) and a few Protestants. Islam is the religion of a significant minority, but it is concentrated in the south of the country, among Bosniaks and most of the Albanian population. There is a small Jewish community.</p>
          <p id="RS.GEOG.6">The capital and largest city is Beograd (Belgrade), which had a population of 1,681,405 at September 2022, according to census results. Vojvodina had an estimated population of 1,740,230 at the census of 2022; its capital is Novi Sad, which had 368,967 inhabitants. Other important towns in Serbia include Niš (with a population of 249,501), Kragujevac (171,186), Subotica (123,952) and Leskovac (123,950).</p>
