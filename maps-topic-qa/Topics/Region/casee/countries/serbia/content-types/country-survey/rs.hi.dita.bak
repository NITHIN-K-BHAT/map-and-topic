          <heading>Under Tito</heading>
          <p>The republics of the Federative People’s Republic of Yugoslavia (FPRY), established on 29 November 1945, were based on Yugoslavia’s recognized nationalities (Croat, Macedonian, Montenegrin, Serb and Slovene) and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Under a Soviet-style Constitution adopted in January 1946, a federation of six republics and two autonomous territories was created. Serbia was sub-divided into `Inner’ Serbia, the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, and the Autonomous Region of Kosovo and Metohija. The latter included an Albanian majority and the former a substantial Hungarian population. Kosovo and Metohija subsequently became an Autonomous Province. The Federal Assembly was composed of a Federal Council; and the Council of Nationalities, representing republics and provinces. Real power, though, was in the hands of the Central Committee of the Komunistička Partija Jugoslavije (KPJ—Communist Party of Yugoslavia).</p>
          <p>
      Under Prime Minister (later President) Josep Broz (Tito)
      
       the nationalization of Yugoslavia’s main assets occurred in 1945-48, and private property was expropriated. Tito pursued policies that did not correspond with those of Yugoslavia’s communist neighbours, resulting, in 1948, in expulsion from the Soviet-dominated Cominform. The FPRY subsequently sought to obtain trade treaties and credits from the West without the obligation of establishing Western parliamentary pluralism and to distance itself from the centralized Soviet system. Limited economic decentralization was adopted in 1950. The KPJ was renamed the Savez Komunista Jugoslavije (SKJ—League of Communists of Yugoslavia) in 1952.
    </p>
          <p> In 1965 state controls on foreign investment and the banking system were further relaxed. However, commercial decisions continued to be taken for political reasons, and the redistribution of wealth between the republics and the federal centre was politically fraught. The tension between decentralization and the SKJ’s monopoly of power led to a desire for political change. The 1974 Constitution strengthened the status of the republics and granted internal powers to Serbia’s Autonomous Provinces. The 1971 collective federal State Presidency was reformed to include representatives from each of the eight constituent parts of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY—as the country had been renamed in 1963). Tito became President for life.</p>
          <p>The contradictions of Tito’s regime were many. Yugoslavia’s unity was achieved by exploiting the fears of hostile foreign neighbours and of animosity between different national groups inside. The latter concern was partially resolved through compromise, as positions of power were rotated between representatives of different national groups. In addition, federal cohesion was promoted by Tito’s personal influence and by the pan-Yugoslav influence of the SKJ and the Jugoslavenska Narodna Armija (JNA—Yugoslav People’s Army).</p>
          <p>Tito died on 4 May 1980, and his responsibilities were transferred to the collective State Presidency and to the Presidium of the SKJ. The President of the State Presidency was titular head of state, a post that rotated annually. Significant problems came to the fore amid nationalist tensions and a deteriorating economic situation. Self-management, as it had developed after the 1974 Constitution, had severe structural deficiencies, and real power had shifted from the federal to the republican governments.</p>

          <heading>The Dissolution of the SFRY</heading>
          <p>In March 1981 protests in Kosovo’s capital, Prishtina (Prishtinë—Priština), over living conditions, led to demonstrations by Albanians throughout Kosovo. The Government declared a state of emergency, but demonstrations recurred in the mid-1980s. From 1986 the Presidency of Serbia, and the Serbian delegate to the federal State Presidency, Ivan Stambolić, demanded constitutional reforms to increase Serbian control of the autonomous provinces; however, the demands were refused. Constitutional change since the 1960s had transferred power in Kosovo to the ethnic Albanian majority. There was large-scale emigration of Serbs from Kosovo throughout the 1970s and 1980s. On 24-25 April 1987 Milošević addressed a large rally of Serbs and Montenegrins at Kosovo Polje, to protest against perceived harassment by the Albanian population.</p>
          <p>Serbian politics were dominated by Slobodan Milošević’s rise to power and the dissolution of the SFRY. Milošević became leader of the Savez Komunista Beograd (League of Communists of Belgrade) in 1984, and of the Savez Komunista Srbije (SKS—Serbian League of Communists) in 1986. He was elected President of the State Presidency of Serbia in May 1989, and remained leader of the Serbian Communists, from July 1990, renamed the Socijalistička Partija Srbije (SPS—Socialist Party of Serbia).</p>
          <p>The special status of Serbia’s two Autonomous Provinces was considered problematic. Milošević launched the `Anti-Bureaucratic Revolution’ movement, and there were demonstrations in Novi Sad, the principal city in Vojvodina, which precipitated the resignation of the provincial party leadership in October 1988. Milošević organized mass demonstrations throughout Serbia and Montenegro in support of the Serb population of Kosovo. In November 1988 a rally held in Belgrade to protest about the treatment of Serbs in Kosovo was attended by nearly 1m. demonstrators. Demonstrations also took place against the Montenegrin Government, which resigned in January 1989. In March federal troops arrived in Kosovo, following large-scale protests by ethnic Albanians in the region.</p>
          <p>Increasing differences between the Serbian and the Slovenian leadership, which favoured looser confederation, also became evident. The SKJ rejected Slovenian proposals to restructure the federal Party, and consequently in February 1990 the Slovenian Party announced its secession from the federal SKJ and changed its name to the Stranka Demokratične Prenove (Party of Democratic Reform). In a referendum held on 2 July 1990 a majority of voters in Serbia approved a new republican Constitution, which effectively removed the autonomous status of Kosovo and Vojvodina and declared Serbia’s sovereignty and independence within Yugoslavia. The Kosovo provincial Assembly and Government were dissolved by the Serbian authorities three days later. The Constitution was promulgated on 28 September. In December multi-party elections were held in several republics. In Montenegro, the Communists retained the Presidency and secured a majority of seats in the republican Assembly. In Serbia, Milošević was elected President. However, opposition increased in 1991, and there were demands for his resignation.</p>
          <p>In mid-March 1991 Milošević repudiated the authority of the State Presidency over Serbia, announcing Serbia’s readiness for full independence. Meanwhile, Croatia and Slovenia announced their intention to secede from the SFRY should a solution not be forthcoming. Tension between Serbia and Croatia increased when, on 15 May, the (automatic) transfer of the Presidency of the federal State Presidency to the Croatian delegate, Stjepan (Stipe) Mesić, was vetoed by the Serbian, Kosovo and Vojvodina members. On 25 June Croatia and Slovenia declared their independence. The federal premier, Ante Marković, ordered the JNA to re-assume control of the Slovenian borders as the legitimate territory of the SFRY. Although the army advanced into Slovenia, it retreated by the end of June. Meanwhile, under a ceasefire agreement, mediated by the European Community (EC, now European Union—EU), Serbs accepted Mesić as President of the federal State Presidency. In Croatia hostilities erupted in Eastern Slavonia and in the new `Serb Autonomous Region of Krajina’, where the JNA worked with local Serb paramilitary units. In July talks on the future of Yugoslavia commenced with the participation of members of the State Presidency and the six republican Presidents.</p>
          <p>Fighting intensified in the second half of 1991 and the JNA and Serb paramilitaries seized control of nearly one-third of Croatia, from which the non-Serb population was expelled. On 8 October the Croatian and Slovenian declarations of independence entered into effect, and in the same month Bosnia and Herzegovina declared sovereignty. Marković and the federal Secretary for Foreign Affairs resigned in November, and in December Mesić resigned, announcing that Yugoslavia had ceased to exist. On 15 January 1992 the EC initiated general recognition of Slovenian and Croatian independence. In March a United Nations (UN) peacekeeping force (UN Protection Force in Yugoslavia—UNPROFOR) was deployed in Croatia. In early 1992 conflict broke out in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which was internationally recognized as an independent state on 6 April. Serbia and Montenegro controlled all Serb forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina until 19 May, when it became formally independent under the self-proclaimed Republika Srpska, established by Bosnian Serb nationalists. Serb forces occupied some 70% of the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and atrocities were perpetrated against the non-Serb population, in what became known as `ethnic cleansing’, with the aim of rendering the territory entirely Serb-inhabited.</p>

          <heading>The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</heading>
          <p>The other republics having formally seceded from the SFRY, in April 1992 Serbia and Montenegro claimed the federation’s international functions. Their 83 deputies to the Federal Assembly voted to establish the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY), comprising the two republics, each of which retained its own government, while a bicameral Federal Assembly was established. Constituences were to elect the members of the lower federal chamber, and the upper house was divided equally between Serbian and Montenegrin repesentatives.</p>
          <p>Elections to the new Federal Assembly took place on 31 May 1992. The SPS benefited from an opposition boycott. Nevertheless, Milošević encountered opposition in mid-1992, with the formation of a broad opposition alliance, the Demokratski Pokret Srbije (DEPOS—Democratic Movement of Serbia). Dobrica Ćosić was appointed federal President and in mid-July Milan Panić became federal Prime Minister. Presidential and parliamentary federal and republican elections were scheduled for 20 December. In the elections (which were subject to a boycot by ethnic Albanians in Kosovo as well as Sandžak Muslims), federal President Ćosić retained his post. Milošević was re-elected as President of Serbia and the SPS secured 47 of the 138 seats available in the Federal Assembly. Panić left office in late December, following a vote of no confidence. A Montenegrin, Rade Kontić, became federal Prime Minister. In February 1993 a new Yugoslav Government, comprising the SPS and the Demo­kratska Partija Socijalista Crne Gore (DPS—Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro), took office.</p>
          <p>The FRY was initially defined by civil conflict in its neighbouring territories, and by international sanctions. Milošević came under intense international pressure to convince the Bosnian Serbs to halt their offensive. EC Governments withdrew their ambassadors, and on 30 May 1992 UN sanctions were imposed against Serbia and Montenegro. Strengthened sanctions were imposed in April 1993, in an effort to persuade the Bosnian Serbs to accept a plan for the cantonization of Bosnia and Herzegovina proposed by the Co-Chairmen of an UN-EC negotiating initiative. Milošević’s expressed support for the plan prompted internal opposition, led, in particular, by his former ally, Vojislav Šešelj, leader of the Srpska Radikalna Stranka (SRS—Serbian Radical Party). In September Šešelj and the SRS members of the Serbian parliament proposed a vote of no confidence in Milošević’s Government. In response, the Government dissolved the parliament and scheduled new elections for 19 December, in which the SPS increased its representation, winning 123 seats. Federal President Ćosić was dismissed and replaced by Zoran Lilić. In August members of the General Staff were removed, including the Chief of Staff of the Jugoslavenska Armija (JA—Yugoslav Army), as the JNA had been renamed.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, a Contact Group, comprising representatives from France, Germany, the Russian Federation, the UK and the USA, proposed the division of Bosnia and Herzegovina into two `entities’, comprising a Croat-Muslim Federation, and a Serb Republic (Republika Srpska). Milošević supported the proposals, and when they were rejected by the Bosnian Serbs he closed Yugoslavia’s border with Bosnia and Herzegovina. Sanctions on international air traffic were lifted in September 1994. The following September the Croatian army pursued a successful campaign with the Muslim-led Bosnian Government forces against the Serbs in western and central Bosnia and Herzegovina. Karadžić was compelled to accept the Contact Group’s proposal. In November a peace conference was held near Dayton, Ohio, USA. Milošević represented the Bosnian Serbs, as Karadžić had been identified as a suspected war criminal by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), based in The Hague, Netherlands. The negotiations sought agreement on the internal borders of two entities, as outlined in the Contact Group plan. After the signing of the Dayton accords, economic and trade sanctions were suspended, Yugoslav reintegration into the international community was prioritized, and Western Governments restored ambassadorial links. Nevertheless, the country remained barred from membership of international organizations, prohibiting the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) from launching investment programmes there. Thus, sanctions continued to have a deleterious effect, and discontent with Milošević’s Government intensified.</p>
          <p>On 23 July 1997 Milošević was inaugurated as federal President, having been elected by the Federal Assembly. In September-October elections to the Narodna Skupština Republike Srbije (National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia—the legislature), the SRS made gains at the expense of the governing coalition, comprising the SPS, Nova Demokratija (New Democracy) and the Jugoslovenska Udružena Levica (JUL—Yugoslav United Left, and led by Milošević’s wife, Mirjana Marković). In elections to the Serbian republican presidency held in December, Milan Milutinović won 59.2% of the votes cast in a second round, defeating Šešelj. On 24 March 1998 it was announced that a new government, comprising the SPS, the SRS and the JUL, was to be formed. Šešelj was appointed Deputy Prime Minister and the SRS took some ministerial portfolios.</p>
          <p>The Montenegrin Government increasingly resented Serbian attempts to dominate the Federal Government. In the ruling DPS a struggle to assert dominance evolved between the President, Bulatović, supported by Milošević, and the Prime Minister, Milo Đukanović. A presidential election was held in Montenegro on 5 October 1997, narrowly won by Đukanović. Relations with Serbia deteriorated in 1999. During the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) military campaign against Yugoslavia in March-June (see below), Đukanović attempted to distance Montenegro from Serbia by refusing to declare a state of emergency and by refusing to permit Montenegrin police forces to come under the command of the JA. Nevertheless, Podgorica and other Montenegrin cities came under NATO attack. However, Đukanović subsequently received international support for his attempts to increase Montenegro’s autonomy. In October the ban on international civilian air traffic with Yugoslavia was lifted in Montenegro.</p>
          <p>The federal authorities continued to oppose efforts by Montenegro to pursue independence, and trade between the two republics virtually ceased; in March-May 2000 Serbia imposed a full economic blockade on Montenegro. In July constitutional changes were approved permitting the direct election of the federal President and of deputies in the Chamber of Republics. Milošević subsequently announced that federal legislative and presidential elections were to be held on 24 September. Đukanović immediately declared that Montenegro would not participate in the elections, although pro-Milošević forces retained substantial support there.</p>

          <heading>Conflict in Kosovo</heading>
          <p>Dissent in Kosovo and Metohija (as the region was named in the 1990 Constitution), where ethnic Albanians constituted almost 90% of the population, led to crisis in 1999. The 1990 Serbian Constitution removed Kosovo’s autonomous status, and the ethnic Albanian population subsequently pursued a policy of non-violent civil disobedience, under Ibrahim Rugova and his Lidhja Demokratike e Kosovës (LDK—Democratic League of Kosovo). A parallel state was created, and ethnic Albanians distanced themselves from state institutions and boycotted elections.</p>
          <p>A paramilitary pro-independence movement, the Ushtria Çlirimtare e Kosovës (UÇK—Kosovo Liberation Army), subsequently emerged. The Contact Group urged negoti­ations between Milošević and Rugova, condemning the activities of both the UÇK and the Serbian Government, which, in January 1998, dispatched troops and special police units to quell UÇK activity. On 23 September the UN Security Council demanded an immediate ceasefire, the withdrawal of Serbian security forces, unrestricted access for humanitarian agencies, and international negotiations to end conflict in Kosovo. The UN Security Council did not vote to endorse NATO military intervention against Yugoslavia, but, nevertheless, NATO began to increase its military capability in the region. By late 1998 approximately 300,000 ethnic Albanians had been displaced from their homes by the Serbian military campaign. On 8 October US special envoy Richard Holbrooke delivered an ultimatum to Milošević, on behalf of NATO, that air strikes would be initiated unless there was full compliance with the Security Council. In late October there were reports of renewed fighting between Serbian government forces and the UÇK, and in early 1999 45 Kosovo Albanians were massacred by Serbian forces in the village of Reçak (Račak). The Contact Group invited representatives from the Serbian Government, the LDK `government’ and the UÇK to Rambouillet, France, for negotiations, which began on 6 February. On 18 March the Kosovo Albanian delegations signed the Rambouillet Accord (Interim Agreement for Peace and Self-Government in Kosovo). The Serbian delegation objected to the lack of a UN role in the agreement and rejected a clause that gave NATO military personnel unrestricted access to Yugoslavia. Nevertheless, the NATO Governments in the Contact Group declared that military targets inside Yugoslavia would be attacked should the Serbian delegation refuse to sign. Western Governments withdrew their diplomatic staff from the FRY, and the OSCE withdrew from Kosovo. On 24 March NATO carried out its first attack on Yugoslavia, against military targets.</p>
          <p>The headquarters of the JA reported renewed attacks by the UÇK, and the refugee crisis worsened as Serbian security forces intensified their offensive. Many ethnic Albanians fled or were forcibly moved from Kosovo. Milošević enjoyed increased support as the population united against the NATO action. In April 1999 NATO intensified its campaign to include transport infrastructure and industrial facilities, and using aircraft and cruise missiles, which resulted in the destruction of non-military targets and civilian deaths, prompting international protests. On 27 May the ICTY indicted Milošević and four other senior officials for war crimes in Kosovo.</p>
          <p>On 2 June 1999, following negotiations between the EU, the USA and Russia, Martti Ahtisaari, a former UN diplomat, and Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russia’s special envoy to the region, visited Belgrade for talks with Milošević. The following day agreement was reached on a peace plan, providing for a verifiable withdrawal of all Serbian security forces from Kosovo; the stationing in Kosovo of an international civilian and military presence under a UN mandate; the return of refugees under the surveillance of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR); demilitarization of the UÇK; and autonomy for Kosovo within Yugoslavia. On 9 June a military agreement was signed in the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia (FYRM), by representatives of both the JA and NATO. NATO troops were given access to Kosovo only through the FYRM and Albania, and there was explicit UN involvement in the interim civilian administration. The next day the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1244 approving the peace agreement (with the People’s Republic of China abstaining). All Serbian security forces left Kosovo by 20 June.</p>
          <p>As attempts were made to establish an interim government, disagreements emerged between Rugova’s LDK and Hashim Thaçi’s UÇK, which claimed recognition for its role in ending direct rule. In early August the UÇK appointed a `provisional government’, despite the UN Security Council Resolution declaring the UN Interim Mission Administration in Kosovo (UNMIK) as the sole legitimate authority. On 24 August UNHCR estimated that of a pre-conflict Serbian population of over 200,000, only 30,000 remained in the region. The failure of the NATO-Russian Kosovo Force (KFOR) and UNMIK to protect the Serb minority in Kosovo was widely criticized. Milošević used the increased economic hardship to enhance his own position in Serbia.</p>

          <heading>The End of the Milošević Era</heading>
          <p>In February 2000 Milošević was re-elected President of the SPS. Under constitutional changes adopted in July he was able to seek a further term, under a new system of direct election to the presidency. Federal presidential and legislative elections took place on 24 September; however, a boycott in Montenegro worked to Milošević’s advantage. In Serbia 18 opposition parties formed the Demokratska Opozicija Srbije (DOS—Democratic Opposition of Serbia), which supported the federal presidential candidacy of Vojislav Koštunica, the leader of the Demokratska Stranka Srbije (DSS—Democratic Party of Serbia). According to provisional results released by the Federal Election Commission, Koštunica won about 48% and Milošević 40% of the votes cast, and a second round of voting was scheduled to take place on 8 October. The DOS disputed the results, claiming that its own estimates indicated that Koštunica had won the election outright. The opposition alliance duly decided not to contest the second round, and instead organized a general strike and mass demonstrations on 5 October, outside the Federal Assembly in Belgrade. Clashes took place between the security forces and demonstrators, and tear gas was used. Demonstrators took control of the Federal Assembly building and the main media institutions. The security forces withdrew. On 6 October, Milošević, having lost the support of both the security forces and the media, acknowledged Koštunica’s victory. The change of power in Yugoslavia was welcomed by the international community.</p>
          <p>A pressing problem for the new Government was the continuing support for Milošević among some factions within the political establishment. Koštunica formed a Federal Government with the support of Montenegrin deputies from Bulatović’s Socijalistička Narodna Partija Crne Gore (SNP—Socialist People’s Party of Montenegro), who opposed Đukanović’s pro-independence policy. The SPS dominated the Serbian republican Assembly, and refused to co-operate with the new federal administration. A compromise was reached that established an interim republican Government for Serbia, with principal posts shared between the DOS and the SPS. Elections to the Serbian republican Assembly were scheduled for 23 December. Some prominent members of the previous regime fled the country. Under Milošević’s continuing presidency of the SPS, the party managed to secure only 13.8% of the votes in the elections to the Assembly. The DOS won an overall majority and the leader of the Demokratska Stranka (DS—Democratic Party), Zoran Đinđić, became Prime Minister. Milutinović, the SPS President of Serbia, remained in place, but power was effectively with the Prime Minister.</p>
          <p>The USA was one of several countries to urge that Milošević be extradited to the ICTY for trial on charges of war crimes. Koštunica instead insisted that Milošević should be tried in Yugoslavia for corruption and other crimes committed during his years in public office. On 1 April 2001 Milošević was arrested. Amid increasing international pressure, he was dispatched to the ICTY on 28 June. Koštunica and the federal Government had not consented to this measure, and recriminations over the extradition ensued. The federal Prime Minister, a Montenegrin deputy from the SNP, resigned, prompting a constitutional issue, as a Montenegrin had to be appointed to maintain the balance of power within the federal administration. Dragiša Pešić of the SNP became Prime Minister. On 3 July Milošević was formally charged with crimes against humanity relating to the conflicts in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Kosovo. The charges against him in connection with Bosnia and Herzegovina were subsequently increased to include genocide. In Serbia Đinđić accused Koštunica of not co-operating with the ICTY, and US insistence resulted in the withholding of further economic aid in March 2002. However, in April the Federal Assembly finally adopted legislation to allow the extradition of suspected war criminals, including the former Minister of the Interior of Serbia, Vlajko Stojiljković (who committed suicide) and the former JA Chief of Staff, Dragoljub Ojdanović. The status of Kosovo remained unresolved: Koštunica, supported by President Vladimir Putin of Russia, insisted that Kosovo was an integral part of Yugoslavia, as defined in the UN Security Council Resolution 1244 (which stipulated substantial autonomy but not independence).</p>
          <p>An extremist breakaway group of the former UÇK, the Ushtria Çlirimtare për Preshevë, Medvegjë dhe Bujanoc (Liberation Army of Preševo, Medvedja and Bujanovac), emerged, amid the Western support for the new Yugoslav administration. Members commenced incursions into the demilitarized security zone separating Kosovo from `Inner’ Serbia, in an effort to extend Kosovo’s borders to include the Preševo valley, with its substantial ethnic Albanian population. In May 2001 it was announced that the introduction of Yugoslav patrols into the security zone would take place later that month on the border with the Preševo valley. By the end of February another UÇK breakaway group, the Ushtria Çlirimtare Kombëtare (National Liberation Army), was in conflict with government security forces in the FYRM. Peace was restored to the FYRM when an internationally mediated ceasefire agreement was reached on 13 August. Rugova was appointed President in Kosovo in March 2002.</p>
          <p>Relations between the Federal Government and the Montenegrin administration remained difficult. In December 2000 Đukanović announced that elections to the Montenegrin republican Assembly, which would effectively determine public opinion on the question of independence, would be conducted in April 2001. The pro-independence coalition, Pobjeda je Crne Gore (Victory Belongs to Montenegro), led by Đukanović, narrowly won, attracting some 42% of the votes, while the federalist Zajedno za Jugoslaviju (Together for Yugoslavia), led by Bulatović, secured 41%. Đukanović formed a Government with the support of the Liberalni Savez Crne Gore (Liberal Alliance of Montenegro), which supported Montenegrin independence, subject to a referendum.</p>
          <p>In July 2001 Đukanović refused to acknowledge Koštunica’s appointment of Pešić as federal Prime Minister. EU-mediated discussions resulted, on 14 March 2002, in the signing of a framework Agreement on Restructuring of Relations between Serbia and Montenegro, which was to be ratified by the republican and federal Assemblies, providing for the formation of a State Union of Serbia and Montenegro. The two republics would have individual administrations, while a joint, unicameral legislature would elect the president, who would propose a Council of Ministers comprising departments of foreign affairs, defence, international economic relations, internal economic relations and the protection of human and minority rights. The agreement guaranteed proportionate representation for Montenegrins in diplomatic offices abroad, and established quotas for Montenegrin representatives in the legislature, and parity of representation in international organizations by means of a system of rotation. After three years, either Serbia or Montenegro would be entitled to initiate proceedings to withdraw from the State Union.</p>

          <heading>The State Union of Serbia and Montenegro</heading>
          <p>After the establishment of the new administration in 2000, Đinđić frequently attempted to assert himself over Koštunica. According to the new arrangements for Serbia and Montenegro, the powers of the President would be significantly limited. Fearing a substantial loss of influence, Koštunica decided to contest the Serbian presidency, in succession to Milutinović, in elections held on 29 September and 13 October 2002. Although Koštunica won a substantial majority in the second ballot, less than 50% of the electorate took part, thereby invalidating the result. A third ballot was held on 8 December, but again the threshold for participation was not met. Subsequently, Đinđić rose to become the most powerful figure in Serbian politics. The Constitution demanded that, in the absence of an elected President, the Speaker of the Serbian republican Assembly, Nataša Mićić, should become acting President. In January 2003 Milutinović lost his immunity from extradition and surrendered to the ICTY. Šešelj was also indicted for crimes against humanity in relation to the non-Serb population in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1991-95, and he surrendered to the Tribunal in February 2003.</p>
          <p>On 4 February 2003 the federal Assembly approved the Constitutional Charter inaugurating the proposed State Union. On 25 February the federal and republican legislatures elected a Skupština Srbije i Crne Gore (Assembly of Serbia and Montenegro), comprising 91 representatives of Serbia and 35 of Montenegro. On 7 March Svetozar Marović, a former Speaker of the Montenegrin legislature, was elected unopposed as President of Serbia and Montenegro by the new Assembly. He also became Prime Minister of the State Union, heading a five-member Council of Ministers.</p>
          <p>
      Meanwhile, in mid-March 2003 Đinđić was killed in Belgrade. Acting President Mićić declared a state of emergency, and Zoran Živković, leader of the DS, became Prime Minister of Serbia. An investigation implicated both former and current members of the state security services, Belgrade’s criminal community and senior government functionaries. Thousands were questioned and numerous people were dismissed from their posts, among them the President of the Serbian Supreme Court, the Chief Prosecutor and many judges, accused of taking bribes and for involvement with organized crime. In particular, the authorities sought to question the leader of one of Belgrade’s most powerful criminal gangs, the Zemun clan, Milorad `Legija’ Ulemek (who had reportedly been responsible for Milošević’s personal security). It was alleged that Đinđić, in return for his support, had protected Ulemek from extradition to the ICTY and ignored his criminal activities. However, Đinđić had allegedly come under increasing pressure to initiate a public campaign against crime and corruption in the weeks before his assassination. In May 2004 Ulemek, who had been on trial

       since December 2003, surrendered to the authorities (he was later convicted of organizing the assassination).
    </p>
          <p>In December 2003 elections to the Serbian legislature were held. The results indicated that the SRS, under the acting leadership of Tomislav Nikolić, had received 28.0% of the votes, Koštunica’s DSS obtained some 18.0%, the DS 12.8%, the liberal G17 Plus 11.6%, an alliance of the Srpski Pokret Obnove (SPO—Serbian Renewal Movement) and Nova Srbija (NS—New Serbia) 7.8% and the SPS 7.7%. Negotiations subsequently continued for two months before a coalition of the DSS, G17 Plus and the SPO-NS alliance, with parliamentary support from the SPS, was eventually established. The Government took office on 3 March 2004, with Koštunica as Prime Minister, and Predrag Marković of G17 Plus as President of the Assembly and acting President of Serbia. A presidential election was scheduled for June, after an attempt to elect a President in November 2003 failed for the third time, owing to a lack of participation; the Assembly had subsequently voted to approve the withdrawal of the requirement for a minimum rate of voter participation of 50%. The Minister of Defence and new President of the DS, Boris Tadić, was nominated as the party candidate, while Nikolić registered to contest the election on behalf of the SRS. Meanwhile, in April the Union Assembly approved a government reorganization; Vuk Drašković received the foreign affairs portfolio and Prvoslav Davinić of G17 Plus became Minister of Defence.</p>
          <p>A principal issue of contention identified by the Government concerned Kosovo. Koštunica issued a declaration supporting a UN Resolution that confirmed Kosovo as an integral part of Serbia, but criticized the status of the minority Serbian population of the province. In March 2004 violent incidents took place throughout the province, with groups of Albanians attacking Serbian villages and destroying homes and religious buildings, while, in response, rioters in Belgrade and Niš attacked local mosques and Islamic objects. NATO responded by dispatching reinforcements to Kosovo and evacuating isolated Serbian communities from their homes.</p>
          <p>In the presidential election on 13 June 2004 Nikolić won 30.1% of votes cast, and Tadić took 27.7%. A second round, between Tadić and Nikolić, was held on 27 June; Tadić benefited from the transferred support of the governing coalition parties, and was elected to the presidency with some 54% of the votes cast.</p>
          <p>The Montenegrin Government meanwhile pursued a claim for independence. An agreement signed on 7 April 2005 provided for elections to the Union Assembly to be held separately in the two republics. It was also agreed that any party organizing a referendum on secession from the joint state would seek the co-operation of the EU in order to ensure that internationally recognized democratic standards were adhered to. On 25 April the EU Council of Ministers confirmed that Serbia and Montenegro had fulfilled the conditions for negotiations to commence on stabilization and integration into the EU, having implemented a number of political, economic, social and administrative reforms.</p>
          <p>The visit of an international Contact Group to both Belgrade and Prishtina in April 2005 resulted in a commitment by all parties to seek a peaceful solution to the Kosovo issue in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1244. In Kosovo, however, the conclusions of the meetings were regarded as preparatory to independence. In Belgrade, Koštunica and Drašković insisted on the integrity of the existing state borders to include Kosovo. They stated that the province would be granted full local autonomy, subject to negotiations.</p>
          <p>Milošević died in custody at the ICTY in March 2006. He was buried with no official recognition from the Government. The ICTY subsequently issued renewed demands that the Government arrest former Bosnian Serb military commander Gen. Ratko Mladić, who was believed to be hiding in Serbia, and provide for his transfer to the Tribunal. Mladić and Karadžić had been indicted by the ICTY for crimes against humanity and for the violation of the laws of war in Bosnia and Herzegovina between April 1992 and July 1995. The Government’s failure to arrest Mladić prompted the EU to announce the suspension in May of negotiations on a Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) between the EU and Serbia and Montenegro. Koštunica subsequently issued a statement urging Mladić to surrender to the au­thor­ities.</p>

          <p>On 21 May 2006 a referendum was conducted in Montenegro on secession from the State Union, under EU supervision. The EU had stated that a minimum of 55% of the total number of votes would be required to validate the decision. The rate of participation was high, at 86.5%, with 55.5% of voters favouring secession. The result of the referendum was duly recognized by the EU and by the Serbian Government and Serbia was acknowledged as the successor state to the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, with continued sovereignty over Kosovo. A referendum held in Serbia in October secured support for a new Constitution, which confirmed the status and accession of the Republic of Serbia as an independent state.</p>
          <p>On 21 January 2007 elections to the Assembly took place. The SRS was the first-placed party, securing 29.1% of the votes cast (and 81 seats), while the DS won 23.1% (with 64 seats) and the DSS obtained 16.8% of the votes (47 seats). Following the elections, no party held an overall majority, and negotiations commenced on the formation of a new governing coalition, which ultimately comprised the DSS, the DS and G17 Plus. On 26 February the International Court of Justice (ICJ), based in The Hague, Netherlands, acquitted Serbia of genocide and related charges in a case for genocide brought by Bosnia and Herzegovina, but found Serbia guilty of a failure both to prevent and to punish genocide, owing to its failure to prevent the massacre at Srebrenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina, in July 1995, and to co-operate in arresting its perpetrators.</p>
          <p>The President of Kosovo, Ibrahim Rugova, died in January 2006; he was succeeded by Fatmir Sejdiu. In February 2007 Ahtisaari, now UN Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Future Status Process for Kosovo, presented a report recommending internationally supervised independence for Kosovo. His proposal asserted that there should be no division of Kosovo; no unification of Kosovo with Albania; full protection for minorities; and the appointment of an international representative, with NATO support, to resolve disputes relating to minority communities. The suggestions were welcomed by the Government of Kosovo, but were rejected by Tadić. Ahtisaari’s proposals were discussed at the UN Security Council, with the support of the UK and the USA. However, the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, opposed any resolution that failed to secure the approval of Serbia and Kosovo, and indicated that Russia might use its Security Council veto.</p>
          <p>In May 2007 the acting leader of the SRS, Nikolić, was elected as President of the Assembly, having obtained DSS support. On 11 May it was announced that the DS, the DSS and G17 Plus had agreed terms for a coalition administration. Koštunica continued as Prime Minister, with ministerial posts divided between the three parties and an agreement to replace Nikolić as President of the Assembly with a DSS deputy.</p>
          <p>In November 2007 discussions between Serbia and Kosovo, mediated by the USA, the EU and Russia, were abandoned, and Kosovo threatened to declare its independence unilaterally should no agreement be reached. Following the installation of Thaçi as Prime Minister in Kosovo, it began to appear inevitable that independence, with US and British support, would take place. On 17 February 2008 the Kosovo Assembly adopted a declaration of independence. The USA and some EU states immediately announced recognition of the independence of Kosovo. The UN did not grant official recognition to Kosovo, and Russia, as a permanent member of the Security Council, threatened to veto any such declaration of recognition.</p>
          <p>A pre-term presidential election in Serbia was scheduled for 20 January 2008. In a first round of voting, Nikolić won 40.0% of the votes, while Tadić secured 35.4%. Since neither candidate achieved the necessary majority, a second round was scheduled for 3 February; this was narrowly won by Tadić, with about 50.3% of the votes. He sought to pursue closer co-operation with the EU, and envisaged Serbia’s eventual admission to the Union. In contrast, Nikolić was perceived as being reluctant to pay heed to EU demands for Serbia’s co-operation with the ICTY. Nevertheless, following the recognition by a majority of EU states in February of Kosovo’s independence Prime Minister Koštunica announced his opposition to further talks with the EU on the SAA unless the EU agreed to recognize the inclusion of Kosovo as an integral part of Serbia. Koštunica, the SRS and other nationalists also organized a large demonstration in Belgrade to protest against the recognition of Kosovo. However, the gathering subsequently degenerated into a riot and there were attacks carried out against the embassies of the USA and some other countries, and one rioter was killed during the violence.</p>
          <p>In March 2008 the governing DS-DSS coalition collapsed when Koštunica resigned from the premiership, and early elections to the Assembly were scheduled. In April Tadić signed Serbia’s SAA with the EU. The decision of the EU to sign the SAA was widely perceived as an effort to demonstrate support for the President’s newly established pro-European alliance, although final ratification of the agreement was not to take place until Serbia had been deemed to have demonstrated full co-operation with the ICTY. At the legislative elections on 11 May, Tadić’s Za Yevropky Srbiju (For a European Serbia) coalition took 38.4% and the SRS 29.4% of votes, although neither side commanded enough seats to form a functioning government. Tadić’s coalition, principally comprising the DS and G17 Plus, held 102 of the 250 legislative seats, and received the support of the Liberalno Demokratska Partija (Liberal Democratic Party), which held 13 seats, and the four Hungarian ethnic representatives from Vojvodina. The SRS held 78 seats and formed an alliance with the DSS, which secured 30 seats. Both sides engaged in negotiations with the SPS, which, with 20 seats, was the party with the next largest representation, in an effort to form a coalition government. (The formation of a new government was required to take place within three months, under the terms of the Constitution.)</p>
          <p>In April 2008 the Kosovo Assembly adopted its new Constitution (which officially entered into effect in June). UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon, announced a plan to transfer UNMIK's functions to an EU Rule of Law Mission (EULEX Kosovo), although UNMIK was to continue to maintain a presence in the ethnically divided town of Mitrovicë (Kosovska Mitrovica). EULEX was to support the Kosovo authorities, with main competencies in the areas of the police, judiciary and customs. (However, Serb and Russian reluctance to accept the EULEX mission subsequently impeded UNMIK's planned transfer of functions.) President Tadić declared the new Kosovo Constitution to be illegal, on the grounds that the territory remained officially the southern province of the Republic of Serbia. The situation in Kosovo remained unstable, after local elections were conducted in the predominantly Serb areas on 11 May, and a Serb legislative assembly (which rejected Kosovo’s independence) was subsequently established at Mitrovicë. On 15 August Serbia submitted a draft resolution to the UN General Assembly, urging the ICJ to issue an opinion on the legality of Kosovo’s declaration of independence. On 8 October the General Assembly voted by 77 votes, with six votes against and 74 abstentions, in favour of asking the ICJ to give an advisory opinion on the matter. Ultimately, on 22 July 2010 the ICJ ruled against Serbia by 10 votes to four, declaring that Kosovo’s declaration of independence did not violate international law, although this decision failed to change the Serbian Government’s policy regarding Kosovo, nor significantly to shift international opinion. On 26 November 2008 the UN Security Council authorized the deployment of EULEX in Kosovo on the basis of the Ban Plan, but to operate in parallel with, rather than in place of, UNMIK. Serbia accepted the deployment of EULEX on the condition that it would be status-neutral with regard to Kosovo, and would not attempt to implement the Ahtisaari plan.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, Tadić reached a coalition agreement with the SPS; a new Government, headed by Mirko Cvetković of the DS, was narrowly approved in the Assembly in July 2008. On 21 July it was announced that Karadžić had been apprehended in an operation by Serbian security officers. The arrest of Karadžić (who was subsequently extradited to the ICTY) was applauded by the international community. Nevertheless, in October the Dutch Government reiterated that it would veto implementation of Serbia’s SAA until Mladić was also arrested.</p>
          <p>The recognition of Kosovo’s independence by the USA and most EU members encouraged, or provided justification for, Serbia’s development of increasingly close relations with Russia. Nevertheless, Serbia continued to pursue entry into the EU. In late 2008 the SRS divided over the question of EU membership, with former acting leader Nikolić heading a pro-EU breakaway group that became the Srpska Napredna Stranka (SNS—Serbian Progressive Party). Serbia submitted an official application for EU membership on 22 December 2009.</p>
          <p>Following the reformists’ victory in the May 2008 legislative elections, Serbia’s leadership continued to balance conflicting pro-EU and nationalist impulses. In February 2010 the Serbian Government accepted the appointment of a new Bosnian ambassador (the post having remained vacant since 2007). On 30 March the Assembly adopted a resolution condemning the Srebrenica massacre, and apologizing for Serbia’s failure to prevent it, although the resolution stopped short of explicitly referring to the massacre as `genocide’. The resolution was intended to improve Serbia’s prospects for EU accession, given its continued failure to arrest Mladić, but was only narrowly approved by the legislature. In May Serbia’s war crimes prosecutor, Vladimir Vukčević, announced the discovery of a mass grave at the village of Rudnica, near the border with Kosovo, which was believed to contain the remains of up to 350 ethnic Albanians. Vukčević cited the discovery as demonstrating evidence that Serbia was willing to confront its past in order to bring those guilty of war crimes to justice.</p>
          <p>On 26 May 2011 the Serbian authorities finally arrested Mladić, shortly after the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso, warned Serbia that its failure to do so was jeopardizing its prospects for EU membership, and after the Chief Prosecutor of the ICTY presented a report to the UN Security Council criticizing Serbia’s failure to co-operate with the Court. Mladić was extradited to The Hague for trial. The last remaining fugitive ICTY indictee in Serbia, Goran Hadžić, former President of the `Republic of Serb Krajina’ (proclaimed by Croatian Serbs in 1991), was arrested by the Serbian au­thor­ities in July and extradited to the ICTY, thereby fulfilling Serbia’s obligations to the Tribunal.</p>
          <p>A crisis at Serbia’s border with Kosovo erupted in mid-2011. Serbia’s ban on imports from Kosovo prompted Kosovo police to attempt to seize border posts in the Serb-controlled north of the territory on 25 July. In retaliation, local Serbs set fire to a border post, shot dead a Kosovo policeman and fired at KFOR troops, after which KFOR took control of the border zone. On 16 September EULEX began to airlift Kosovo government officials to the border posts, prompting local Serbs to set up barricades across northern Kosovo in an effort to blockade the border. Clashes occurred between Kosovo Serbs and KFOR later that month. President Tadić publicly urged the Kosovo Serbs to dismantle their barricades, and by the end of December had succeeded in bringing about the removal of some of them. However, the dismantling of the barricades was obstructed by the nationalist opposition in Serbia, particularly the SRS and DSS, whose politicians and supporters regularly visited the barricades to encourage the Kosovo Serbs’ rebellion.</p>
          <p>Owing to Serbia’s failure to bring about the removal of all the barricades in northern Kosovo, on 9 December 2011 the European Council failed to grant Serbia EU candidate status. Instead, the Council demanded that Serbia meet additional conditions, in particular full co-operation with EULEX and an end to efforts to exclude Kosovo from regional inter-state meetings. This marked a major reverse, prompting the resignation of Serbia’s Deputy Prime Minister. On 24 February 2012 Serbia consequently reached an agreement with the Kosovo au­thor­ities, mediated by the EU, whereby Serbia would accept Kosovo's participation at regional meetings and the two states would jointly manage their mutual border. According to the terms of the compromise, Kosovo’s nameplate at such meetings would contain a reference both to UN Resolution 1244 (at the demand of Serbia) and to the ICJ’s 2010 ruling in favour of the legality of Kosovo’s declaration of independence (which Kosovo demanded). Consequently, at the end of February EU Ministers of Foreign Affairs voted in favour of granting official EU candidate status for Serbia, which was formally granted on 1 March.</p>
          <p>President Tadić resigned on 5 April 2012, in order to bring forward the next presidential election to coincide with parliamentary elections scheduled for 6 May. In the legislative elections, a grouping led by the SNS, Pokrenimo Srbiju—Tomislav Nikolić (Let’s Get Serbia Moving—Tomislav Nikolić), secured 73 seats, with 24.0% of the votes cast, while the DS-led coalition, Izbor za Bolji Život—Boris Tadić (Choice for a Better Life—Boris Tadić), received 67 seats, with 22.1% of the votes; the electoral alliance of SPS leader Dačić performed strongly, obtaining 44 seats (14.5% of the votes). At the presidential election, contested by 12 candidates, Tadić received about 25.3% and Nikolić 25.1% of the votes; a second round was scheduled for 20 May. The DS and the SPS subsequently reached agreement on the establishment of a coalition at central and local level, while the SPS-led alliance was to support Tadić in the second presidential round. Nevertheless, on 20 May Nikolić unexpectedly defeated Tadić with 49.5% of votes cast in the second round. Nikolić, who had campaigned on pledges to further Serbia’s course of EU integration, was sworn in to office on 31 May. His victory was received with particular consternation by the Kosovo authorities, owing to concerns that he would support the Serbs in the north who favoured the partitioning of Kosovo. On 28 June Dačić received a mandate to form a new government, and on 27 July the Assembly approved the formation of a new administration, in which Dačić was to serve as Minister of Internal Affairs as well as Prime Minister.</p>
          <p>Following his election, Nikolić rapidly increased regional tensions by making aggressive nationalistic statements, referring to Vukovar, Croatia, as `a Serb city’ and stating that genocide had not taken place at Srebrenica, and declaring that he would not attend the annual commemoration of the massacre in the city in July. Tensions were exacerbated further by the stance of former Minister of Foreign Affairs Vuk Jeremić, who was elected President of the UN General Assembly on 8 June. The decision of the ICTY Appeal Chamber, on 18 November, to overturn the conviction of two Croatian former generals, Ante Gotovina and Mladen Markač, followed by the Trial Chamber’s acquittal, on 29 November, of former Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj, in both cases for war crimes against Serbs, prompted vehement criticism of the Tribunal by Nikolić, Dačić and Jeremić.</p>
          <p>
      Jeremić used his position at the UN to convene a debate at the General Assembly on the topic of international criminal justice—in practice an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of the ICTY—in April 2013. The debate (which representatives of the USA, Croatia and other countries, or of the ICTY itself did not attend) provided the occasion for a further attack on the ICTY by Nikolić, who compared it to an `inquisition’. However, the Serbian campaign against the ICTY was deflated by the Appeal Chamber’s acquittal of former JA Chief of Staff Momčilo Perišić on 28 February, which helped to restore the Tribunal’s reputation for impartiality in the perception of its critics. Subsequently, the ICTY’s acquittal on all charges of two senior Serbian security officials, Jovica Stanišić and Franko Simatović, on 30 May 2013, and of SRS leader Šešelj on 31 March 2016 caused even some supporters of the ICTY to criticize it for leniency. (Šešelj’s acquittal was partially overturned in April 2018, when he was sentenced 
      <i>in absentia</i>
       to 10 years in prison on three charges of crimes against humanity, although it was ruled that he had already served more than 10 years in pre-trial detention at The Hague.)

          <heading>Developments in 2013-20</heading>
          <p>Nevertheless, it was the political leadership of Nikolić and Dačić that achieved, under heavy EU pressure, the breakthrough in relations with Kosovo that had eluded their predecessors. On 19 April 2013, after lengthy EU-mediated negotiations, an agreement was reached between Serbia and Kosovo, and was initialled by their respective Prime Ministers. Under this agreement, Serbia recognized the authority of Kosovo over the whole of its territory, while the Kosovo Government was to permit the establishment of an Association of Serb Municipalities, through which Kosovo Serbs would be accorded a degree of autonomy. The police and judiciary of Kosovo were to be unified, but the police in the four Serb-majority municipalities in northern Kosovo (Mitrovicës së Veriut/Severna Mitrovica—North Mitrovicë, Zveçan/Zvečan, Zubin Potok and Leposaviq/Leposavić) were to be granted an autonomous Police Regional Commander, while the Appellate Court in Prishtina was to establish both a panel with a Serb majority responsible for predominantly Serb municipalities and a Serb-majority division for North Mitrovicë. </p>
          <p>Following this accord, on 22 April 2013 the European Commission recommended the opening of EU membership negotiations with Serbia. In June the Euro­pean Council officially endorsed the opening of accession talks with Serbia. Nikolić, together with other regional heads of state, attended celebrations to mark Croatia’s accession to the EU in the Croatian capital, Zagreb, on 1 July 2013. Meanwhile, Serbia fulfilled its commitments under the agreement, and in October Dačić urged Serbs in Kosovo to abandon plans for a boycott of Kosovo’s scheduled municipal elections, and instead to participate so as to achieve control of government in those municipalities in which they formed a majority. EU membership negotiations duly commenced on 21 January 2014.</p>
          <p>Parliamentary elections were held in Serbia on 16 March 2014, producing victory for the SNS, with 48.4% of the votes and an absolute majority of 158 seats. SNS President Aleksandar Vučić, formerly First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence, assumed office as Prime Minister of a coalition Government on 27 April. The March elections were also significant for the eclipse of the formerly ruling DS, which narrowly secured parliamentary representation with 6.0% of the votes—a poor performance exacerbated by the defection of Tadić from the party at the start of the year.</p>
          <p>International developments in 2014 emphasized the continued awkwardness of Serbia’s geopolitical position. Russia annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea in March, prompting the EU to impose sanctions against Russia, and placing Serbia, as both an EU candidate country and an ally of Russia, in a difficult position. On 1 April Vučić, as deputy premier and Prime Minister-designate, announced that Serbia recognized Ukraine’s territorial integrity but would not participate in the sanctions. Nevertheless, his Government, dominated by former SRS members, did not initiate any change in a Serbian policy that was still orientated towards EU membership.</p>
          <p>Tensions with Kosovo were heightened in January 2015, after Aleksandar Jablanović, Kosovo’s ethnic Serb Minister of Communities and Resettlement, denounced demonstrating Albanians, who had physically prevented Serbs from attending a Christmas church service in the town of Gjakovë/Đakovica, as `savages’. Jablanović’s comments precipitated mass protests in Kosovo and prompted his dismissal by Prime Minister Isa Mustafa on 3 February, which in turn resulted in complaints from the Serbian Government. Yet the dialogue between Serbia and Kosovo continued, and in an interview published on 8 May, Vučić indicated his readiness to countenance changes to Serbia’s Constitution that would remove the reference to Kosovo as a Serbian province.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, the planned Association of Serb Municipalities in Kosovo had not been established, owing to the failure to agree on the extent of its competencies, and relations between Kosovo and Serbia had deteriorated. In December 2016 the erection of a wall behind the bridge on the Ibar River by the Serb municipal authorities of North Mitrovicë was a cause of further dissent. (The wall was demolished in February 2017, following a resolution issued by the Kosovo legislature.) In January Serbia attempted to reopen a direct train link between Belgrade and Mitrovicë, with the first train bearing the slogan `Kosovo is Serbia’ in 21 languages. Consequently, the Kosovo authorities barred it from entering the territory, and President Nikolić, in turn, threatened military intervention. Tensions again intensified following the assassination, in mid-January 2018, of Oliver Ivanović, a prominent and relatively moderate Kosovo Serb politician. On 26 March the head of the Serbian Government’s Office for Kosovo and Metohija, Marko Đurić, was arrested by Kosovo police in North Mitrovicë, on the grounds that his entry into the territory had been illegal.</p>
          <p>Serbia continued to obstruct the accession of Kosovo to international bodies, although it was unable to prevent the territory’s admission to the Union of European Football Associations in early May 2016, and subsequently to the Fédération Internationale de Football Association in mid-May. A significant majority of UN member states recognize Kosovo, although several EU member states do not.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, in May 2015 Vučić announced that his Government would acknowledge US calls to reduce Serbia’s dependence on Russian gas by participating in the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline project, which aimed to transport gas to Europe from Azerbaijan. Nevertheless, in May 2016 Serbia signed a new agreement with Russia on military co-operation, indicating its continued policy of balancing relations between Russia and the West. In February 2017 the Ministry of Defence announced that it was to receive six Russian fighter jets, along with Russian aviation experts to enable their integration into the Serbian air force. Meanwhile, Montenegro’s admission to NATO in June, following that of Croatia and Albania in April 2009, emphasized Serbia’s exclusion from the now dominant power bloc in the region.</p>
          <p>Differences became apparent between Vučić and his predecessor as SNS leader, Nikolić, who had left the party in May 2012 and continued to pursue more nationalistic policies. Nikolić’s announcement in May 2015 that he would not attend the 20th anniversary commemorations at Potočari, Bosnia and Herzegovina, of the Srebrenica massacre on 11 July drew strong criticism from Bosnia. There was speculation in the Serbian media that Vučić and Nikolić were divided over the latter’s `Platform on Kosovo’, which he presented formally to the Prime Minister in May: by advocating the division of Kosovo into two zones, with the north enjoying more autonomy according to the existing terms of Serbia’s Constitution, and the south only a higher degree of autonomy based on the territory's previous status in the SFRY, the Platform was incompatible with EU demands for the continuation of talks on the normalization of relations between Serbia and Kosovo. Although Vučić dismissed the disagreement, it was indicative of the extent to which Serbia’s politicians remained caught between the conflicting demands of the EU accession process and of nationalists. This was highlighted once again when, on 8 July, at Serbia’s request, Russia vetoed a British-drafted UN Security Council resolution in favour of recognizing the Srebrenica massacre as genocide. Consequently, although Vučić attended the international memorial event at Potočari, his presence provoked anger from some in the crowd, and he was obliged to leave after being pelted with missiles.</p>
          <p>The progress of Serbia’s EU accession negotiations was complicated by deteriorating relations with Croatia, owing in part to the migration crisis that overwhelmed Central and Eastern Europe in late 2015. In that year Serbia became a conduit for thousands of migrants from the Middle East and North Africa attempting to reach Western Europe. Hungary in July announced the construction of a fence on its border with Serbia to curb the inflow. In late September Croatia barred all road traffic from Serbia, stating that 30,000 migrants had entered its territory from Serbia in the previous week. Although an agreement was reached in late October, following EU mediation, to regulate the flow of migrants from Serbia to Croatia, relations remained strained. The ICTY’s acquittal on all charges of Šešelj, who the year before had burned a Croatian flag in Belgrade and reiterated nationalist claims to Serbian territory, on 31 March 2016 further aggravated tensions between the two countries.</p>
          <p>On 17 January 2016 Vučić, with the stated aim of securing a further mandate of support for his economic reform programme, scheduled pre-term parliamentary elections for 24 April. These, held in two rounds, resulted in the SNS-led coalition winning 48.3% of the votes and retaining its majority in the National Assembly—albeit reduced—with 131 of the 250 seats. Vučić and the SNS thus remained at the helm of Serbian politics, but in a weaker position than before. After a lengthy delay, on 8 August Vučić finally announced the formation of a new Government, which was once again a coalition dominated by the SNS and the SPS. Symbolic of social change in the country, this Government included Serbia’s first openly homosexual minister, Ana Brnabić, as Minister of Public Administration and Local Self-Government.</p>
          <p>In the presidential election on 2 April 2017, Nikolić opted not to seek a second term and endorsed Vučić, who stood as the SNS candidate, securing a decisive victory in the first round, with 55.1% of the votes cast, while the second-placed candidate, independent Saša Janković, received 16.4%. Voter disaffection was reflected in the fact that parody candidate Luka Maksimović, a 25-year-old comedian contesting the poll under a satirical name, was placed third, with 9.4% of the votes. Vučić’s candidacy was also endorsed by Russian President Putin, and critics accused the Government of restricting media freedom and intimidating voters during the campaign, expressing concerns that as President Vučić might seek to control the government through a `puppet’ Prime Minister. A campaign of popular anti-Government protests, initially organized by students, ensued in Belgrade and other major cities, and continued throughout April. On 31 May, when Vučić was sworn in as President, SPS leader Dačić, as the first Deputy Prime Minister, assumed office as acting premier. After Vučić nominated Brnabić as Prime Minister, a new coalition Government was voted into office by the National Assembly on 29 June. Support for the President and Government was demonstrated by the victory of the coalition headed by the SNS in the Belgrade city elections on 4 March 2018.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, the discontent of wide sections of the population became evident when mass protests broke out following an assault against Borko Stefanović, a politician of the opposition Levica Srbije (Serbian Left) party, on 23 November 2018. The opposition was mobilized by resistance to the perceived growth of government authoritarianism under Vučić. According to the 2019 report of US-based human rights organization Freedom House, Serbia experienced one of the world’s sharpest declines in freedom in that year, resulting in a change of its status from `free’ to `partly free’, due to a deterioration in the conduct of elections, the harassment of the opposition media and the accumulation of executive power by the Government. An attack on the residence of investigative journalist Milan Jovanović in December 2018 was a further catalyst. The protests, which were organized on a weekly basis in a number of cities, regularly numbered over 10,000 in Belgrade, making them the largest such demonstrations since the overthrow of Milošević in 2000. On 16 March 2019 protesters stormed the building of the state broadcaster and surrounded the President’s residence, precipitating police attacks on the crowds with tear gas, and several arrests. In response to Vučić’s pledge that he would not negotiate with the protesters even if they numbered five million, the movement adopted the slogan `one in five million’. Nevertheless, the broad-based and non-partisan character of the protests was inclusive of the nationalist extreme right, including Boško Obradović of the Srpski Pokret `Dveri’ (Serbian Movement `Doors’) party, and nationalistic utterances by some of the protesters alienated opinion outside Serbia. With Vučić and the SNS retaining the support of over one-half of the population according to polls, the Serbian political leadership remained largely intransigent in the face of the protests. Despite a decline in the numbers of participants, the anti-Government protests continued until 16 March 2020, when they were suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the protest organizers announced a boycott of the forthcoming parliamentary elections (scheduled for 26 April, but postponed until 21 June, due to the COVID-19 crisis). The Savez za Srbiju (Alliance for Serbia), the major coalition of opposition parties formed in September 2019, comprising the DS, Dveri, the Narodna Stranka (NS—People’s Party), the Stranka Slobode i Pravde (SSP—Party of Freedom and Justice), Otadžbina (Fatherland), the Pokret za Preokret (Movement for Reversal) and the Udruženi Sindikati Srbije `Sloga’ (United Trade Unions of Serbia), announced that it would participate in the boycott.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, further protests by right-wing and nationalist elements took place in Belgrade on 8 January 2020 in response to Montenegro’s Law on Freedom of Religion or Belief and the Legal Status of Religious Communities, which potentially allowed ownership of Serbian Orthodox Church assets in Montenegro to be transferred to the Montenegrin state. Leading Serbian figures, including Vučić and Patriarch of the Serbian Orthodox Church Irinej, condemned the Montenegrin Government’s move, while Serb nationalist protests against it also erupted across Montenegro, leading some commenters to suggest that only Montenegro’s membership of NATO deterred Serbia’s engineering of a Bosnian-style war in that country. However, Serbia signed an agreement with Turkey (known as Türkiye from mid-2022) on 7 October 2019 to increase military co-operation, and an accord on economic co-operation with North Macedonia and Albania on 10 October, which was labelled a `Mini Schengen’ zone in the media, envisaging the free movement of people, goods, capital and services between the three countries. These moves highlighted the pragmatic character of Vučić’s regional policy.</p>
          <p>President Vučić’s status as one of Putin’s closest foreign allies was demonstrated on 9 May 2018, when he attended Victory Day celebrations (commemorating the end of the Second World War) in the Russian capital, Moscow. Meanwhile, extensive talks between Vučić and Thaçi, President of Kosovo, produced a controversial joint statement that they were considering an exchange of territory to facilitate a settlement between Serbia and Kosovo. This proposal prompted widespread opposition in both Serbia and Kosovo, including from Haradinaj (who again held the post of Kosovo Prime Minister). Bilateral relations worsened after the Kosovo Government imposed punitive tariffs of 100% on Serbian goods in November, in response to Serbia’s ongoing campaign against international recognition of Kosovo, and the Kosovo Assembly in December approved legislation providing for the formation of its own army, in violation of UN Resolution 1244. Relations between Serbia and Kosovo remain fraught. For its part, the European Commission issued a draft report in late May 2019 expressing concern about the state of media freedom in Serbia, the extent of corruption, the state of minority rights and the possibility of fair elections. On 14 October members of China’s Communist Party and Serbia’s SNS, including Vučić and Brnabić (who had joined the party four days previously) met in Belgrade and pledged `all-time’ friendship. On 6 December a Russian delegation from Crimea visited Belgrade and distributed medals to far-right Serbian nationalists, prompting a complaint from the Ukrainian ambassador. In these circumstances, the future of Serbia’s European integration and international alignment seemed far from certain.</p>
          <p>Vučić and Kosovo’s Prime Minister, Avdullah Hoti, signed agreements in Washington, DC, USA, on 4 September 2020, which provided for the normalization of economic relations, involving commitments to develop a highway and railway between Belgrade and Prishtina, the membership of both states in the `Mini-Schengen’ zone, and the mutual recognition of diplomas and professional certificates. The deal was part of a diplomatic initiative on the part of US President Donald Trump that also involved Israel’s recognition of Kosovo’s independence and the establishment of relations between the two countries, with Kosovo to open an embassy in Jerusalem. Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu announced that Serbia would also relocate its embassy to Jerusalem, but after the EU warned Serbia against the move, Vučić refused to commit to it. Serbian government sources additionally suggested that Serbia would certainly not effect the relocation if Israel recognized Kosovo.</p>

          <heading>Serbia’s Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic</heading>
          <p>On 12 March 2020 Serbia closed 44 border crossings with its neighbouring states in order to contain the spread of COVID-19. President Vučić declared a state of emergency on 15 March, which banned the entry of foreign citizens into Serbia, while returning Serbian citizens were required to self-isolate for 14 days. Serbia’s schools and kindergartens were closed, while public transport was reduced and citizens instructed to work at home. Migrants and asylum seekers in state detention centres were banned from going outside without special permission. This measure provided the opportunity for members of far-right groups such as Dveri to patrol the country’s streets in pursuit of migrants suspected of violating rules concerning public movement or gatherings.</p>
          <p>On 18 March 2020 the Government imposed a curfew, and two days later the closure of cafés, bars, retail stores, shopping malls, gyms and public transport was ordered. On 2 April outdoor gatherings of more than two people were banned. The state of emergency and curfew were lifted on 6 May, and businesses permitted to reopen provided that they respected social distancing guidelines. Public transportation was restarted on 18 May. The restrictions on the entry into Serbia of citizens and foreign nationals, and on the movement of residents within the country were lifted by the beginning of June, although social distancing guidelines continued to apply.</p>
          <p>Following the easing of restrictive measures, the postponed legislative elections proceeded on 21 June 2020. Owing to the boycott of major opposition forces (which had prompted the introduction of amendments shortly beforehand, lowering the threshold for parliamentary representation from 5% to 3%), the SNS-led coalition, Za Našu Decu (For Our Children), obtained a `supermajority’ of 188 seats in the National Assembly, with 63.0% of the votes cast. An alliance of the SPS and Jedinstvena Srbija (United Serbia) received 32 seats, with 10.8% of the votes, and the newly formed, populist Srpski Patriotski Savez (Serbian Patriotic Alliance) 11 seats, and 4.0% of the votes. Amid the continuing pandemic, a voter participation rate of only 48.9% was recorded.</p>
          <p>On 7 July 2020 President Vučić announced the reimposition of restrictions, including a weekend curfew, in Belgrade, in response to a further escalation of the COVID-19 outbreak. Further anti-Government protests erupted in Belgrade later that day, and rapidly degenerated into violence when a large group of demonstrators broke into the parliamentary building. Opponents of the Government denounced the lifting of emergency restrictions in May, which had allowed the elections (and major sporting events) to take place. On the following day Vučić denounced the protests but withdrew his plans to reinstate a curfew, on the grounds that the measure would require the declaration of a further nationwide state of emergency. However, large numbers of protesters demanding the resignation of Vučić continued to gather around the parliamentary building, resulting in further large-scale clashes with police, in which a number of people were injured; protests were also staged in Novi Sad and other major cities. Protests continued for the next few weeks, with the last major protest in Belgrade taking place on 3 August. A student protest took place in front of the Ministry of Education on 5 October, and small businesses organized demonstrations during December over economic difficulties arising from the pandemic; after one demonstrator became ill and died on 23 December, the protests were halted.</p>
          <p>Developments in this period heightened fears of growing authoritarianism in Serbia under Vučić. The Independent Journalists’ Association of Serbia registered 28 physical attacks and 33 threats or acts of intimidation against journalists between January 2020 and the end of August. Journalists Zikica Stevanović and Igor Stanojević were beaten by police while reporting on protests against pandemic-related restrictions on 10 July. On 15 July the convictions of four state security officers for the 1999 murder of journalist and editor Slavko Ćuruvija were overturned on appeal by the Belgrade Appeals Court. Veljko Belivuk, a suspected leader of a Belgrade organized crime group linked to the Partizan football club, was arrested on 5 February 2021, but critics suggested that this represented a dispute between Vučić and a criminal who had formerly been his ally and was linked to the security forces.</p>
          <p>However, Serbia received widespread acclaim for its speed and efficiency in providing COVID-19 vaccinations. It offered anyone aged 18 or over a free vaccine. Minister of Health Zlatibor Lončar claimed that the success was due to Serbia’s readiness to acquire vaccines from the West, Russia and China without discrimination. Most of its supply of vaccines came from Russia and China, and it received visitors seeking vaccination from other countries in the region, as well as further afield. Serbia additionally supplied vaccines to neighbouring countries.</p>
          <p>The issue of COVID-19 restrictions polarized Serbian public opinion. On 12 January 2022 Prime Minister Brnabić publicly rebuked the country’s international tennis star, Novak Đoković, for flouting COVID-19 regulations, at the height of Đoković’s high-profile legal struggle with the Australian authorities over his attempt to compete in the Australian Open tournament despite being unvaccinated, which ultimately ended with his exclusion from the tournament. Nevertheless, Đoković’s stance received widespread but not universal support in Serbia, with President Vučić decrying his `harassment’ by the Australian authorities. Consequently, along with other European countries, Serbia began to lift COVID-19 restrictions gradually, ending all pandemic-related entry restrictions for foreign visitors on 3 May.</p>

          <heading>Serbia since 2020</heading>
          <p>Early parliamentary elections, together with a presidential election, were held on 3 April 2022. Vučić was re-elected President with 58.6% of the votes cast (an increase of 3.5% compared with 2017), compared with 18.4% for Zdravko Ponoš of the NS, the candidate of new opposition coalition Ujedinjena za Pobedu Srbija (UZPS—United for the Victory of Serbia), comprising the NS, the SSP, the DS and several smaller parties. An increased voter turnout of 58.6% was recorded in the parliamentary elections, following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions. The SNS-led coalition’s share of the vote fell to 43.0%, resulting in a drop in its representation to 120 seats and the loss of its parliamentary majority, while the UZPS won 13.7% of the vote and 38 seats, the SPS-led coalition won 11.4% of the vote and 31 seats, and three extreme right parties or coalitions, Dveri, the Nacionalno Demokratska Alternativa (National Democratic Alternative) and Srpska Stranka Zavetnici (Serbian Party Oathkeepers), together won 12.9% of the vote and 35 seats. The results, according to the OSCE observer mission, reflected the fact that, while the elections themselves were formally conducted under fair conditions, the government parties had benefited from disproportionate access to media and to campaign funds, and widespread pressure on public employees to support their candidates. The elections demonstrated that Vučić is significantly more popular in Serbia than his SNS, but that he has not attained the degree of security in power of, for example, Russian President Putin or Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.</p>
          <p>Following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, Serbia has continued to seek to steer a course between Russia and the West. Serbia voted in favour of both the motion in the UN General Assembly on 2 March to condemn the Russian invasion and its motion on 7 April to suspend Russia from the UN Human Rights Council. However, Vučić did not personally condemn the invasion and Serbia did not join Western sanctions against Russia. On 29 May Vučić announced a new natural gas deal with Russian state-controlled company Gazprom, in open defiance of Western policy, yet in a speech two days later, on the occasion of his inauguration as President, he expressed his intention to prioritize the pursuit of Serbia’s EU membership and hinted at the possibility of joining sanctions against Russia. On 12 October Serbia backed a UN General Assembly resolution condemning Russia’s annexation of four regions in eastern Ukraine at the end of September. On 23 October Vučić announced a government reorganization that excluded several pro-Russia ministers. This balancing act reflected the reality of Serbia’s simultaneous economic dependence on both the EU and Russia, a population that neither supports Russia against Ukraine nor wishes to join the sanctions against it, and the electoral threat to the government parties from a pro-Russia extreme right. It has also paid dividends for Vučić, as the West has continued to seek his support, and began to shift in favour of Serbia against Kosovo in escalating disputes between the two countries.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, Serbia’s issue of car licence plates to Serbs in Kosovo, which was considered illegal by the Kosovo Government, prompted the latter on 29 June 2022 to threaten to fine those using such plates. On 5 November the Serb mayors of four cities in northern Kosovo (North Mitrovica, Leposavić, Zvečan, and Zubin Potok) were among numerous Serb officials to resign in protest over the licence plate dispute. The dispute was apparently resolved by late November, with Serbia agreeing to stop issuing licence plates in exchange for the Kosovo authorities suspending action against their users over the re-registration of vehicles. However, on 18 January 2023 Kosovo’s Minister of Internal Affairs and Public Administration, Xhelal Sveçla, announced that Kosovo was denying entry to vehicles with licence plates issued by Serbia, in violation of the agreement. Tensions had also escalated in December 2022, with violent protests by Kosovo Serbs, who erected roadblocks at border crossings in northern Kosovo, prompted by the Kosovo authorities’ arrest of a former Serb police officer; the barricades were removed on 29 December, after the authorities agree to transfer him to house arrest.</p>
          <p>On 27 February 2023 a verbal agreement was mediated between Serbia and Kosovo by the EU at Ohrid, North Macedonia, whereby Serbia would cease to obstruct Kosovo’s entry into international organizations and recognize its state documents and symbols, while Kosovo would move to establish the Association of Serb Municipalities. However, Kosovo’s Prime Minister, Albin Kurti, was subsequently rebuked by the EU for refusing to accept a draft statute for the Association on 2 May. Meanwhile, on 23 April extraordinary municipal elections to replace the mayors who had resigned were boycotted by Kosovo Serbs, resulting in a turnout of only 3.5% and the election of ethnic Albanian candidates to the four mayoralties. When Kosovo deployed special police forces to install the newly elected mayors in their offices, riots were precipitated in which Kosovo Serbs attacked KFOR forces, wounding over 30 of them, while Serbia deployed its army on Kosovo’s border. Western governments, including those of the USA, the UK and Italy, condemned Kosovo’s Government over the incident but did not condemn Serbia.</p>
          <p>Some observers considered the attacks on the KFOR troops to have been instigated by Vučić to generate nationalist support in the face of large demonstrations in Belgrade against his rule. These were triggered by a mass shooting on 3 May 2023 by a male student at a Belgrade school, in which nine people were killed and six wounded, followed by a second mass shooting at a village south of Belgrade on the night of 4-5 May, in which eight were killed and 14 wounded. One-half of those killed in the two incidents were children. Serbia, together with Montenegro, has the third-highest rate of civilian gun ownership per capita in the world, and Vučić responded to the shootings by announcing measures to restrict gun ownership. However, on 27 May tens of thousands demonstrated against gun violence in central Belgrade and demanded Vučić’s resignation. He responded by resigning as leader of the SNS as a concession to the opposition. However, protests in Belgrade demanding his resignation as President continued (the seventh being held on 17 June), with some observers suggesting that the campaign marked the beginning of the end of his regime.</p>
