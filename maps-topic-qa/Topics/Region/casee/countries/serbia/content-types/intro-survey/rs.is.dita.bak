               <p id="RS.IS.3">The Republic of Serbia is situated in the central Balkan Peninsula, in South-Eastern Europe, and is landlocked. There are western borders (from south to north) with Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Croatia, and borders with Hungary to the north, Romania and Bulgaria to the east, and North Macedonia to the south. Kosovo (which declared independence from Serbia in 2008, having been an autonomous province within the country) also lies to the south. The climate is continental, with steady rainfall throughout the year. The average summer temperature in Belgrade is 22°C (71°F), the winter average being 0°C (32°F). The official language is Serbian, which is officially written in the Cyrillic script. Orthodox Christianity is predominant, the Serbian Orthodox Church being the largest denomination. There are small Jewish and Roman Catholic communities. The national flag (proportions 1 by 2) has three equal horizontal stripes, of blue, white and red. The capital is Belgrade (Beograd).</p>

                    <heading>Historical Context</heading>
                    <p id="RS.IS.5">A pact between Serbia (under Ottoman Turkish rule until the 19th century) and other South Slavs was signed in July 1917, declaring the intention to form a united state under the Serbian monarchy. Accordingly, when the First World War ended, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was proclaimed on 4 December 1918. Prince Aleksandar, Regent of Serbia since 1914, became King in August 1921. Following bitter disputes between Serbs and Croats, King Aleksandar assumed dictatorial powers in 1929, when he formally changed the country’s name to Yugoslavia. After Aleksandar was assassinated by Croat extremists in 1934, his brother, Prince Pavle, assumed power as Regent. An anti-Government group, the Komunistička Partija Jugoslavije (KPJ—Communist Party of Yugoslavia), had been proscribed in 1921, but continued to operate clandestinely. In 1937 the KPJ ap­pointed a new General Secretary, Josip Broz (Tito).</p>
                    <p id="RS.IS.7">In March 1941 the increasingly pro-German regime of Prince Pavle was overthrown in a coup, and a Government that supported the Allied Powers of the Second World War was installed, with King Petar II as head of state. In April, however, German and Italian forces invaded, forcing the royal family and Government into exile. Resistance to the occupation forces was initially divided between two rival groups. The Yugoslav Army of the Fatherland (Četniks) operated mainly in Serbia and represented the exiled Government, while the National Liberation Army (Partisans), led by the KPJ, under Gen. (later Marshal) Tito, recruited supporters from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro and Slovenia. Rivalry between the two groups led to civil war, eventually won by the communist Partisans, which, on 29 November 1943, proclaimed their own government in liberated areas. Petar II was deposed in 1944.</p>
                    <p id="RS.IS.8">After the war ended, elections were held for a Provisional Assembly. The Federative People’s Republic of Yugoslavia was proclaimed on 29 November 1945, with Tito as Prime Minister. A Constitution was adopted in January 1946, establishing a federation of six republics (Serbia, Montenegro, Croatia, Slovenia, Macedonia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina) and two autonomous provinces within Serbia (Kosovo and Metohija, with a substantial Albanian population, and Vojvodina, with a large Hungarian population).</p>
                    <p id="RS.IS.9">
          The KPJ was renamed the Savez Komunista Jugoslavije (SKJ—League of Communists of Yugoslavia) in 1952, by which time it had established exclusive political control. A new Constitution was adopted in 1953, and Tito became President of the Republic. Another Constitution, promulgated in April 1963, changed the country’s name to the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Although links with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) were resumed in 1955, Yugoslavia largely pursued a policy of non-alignment, the first conference of the 
          <xr pageref="Y" ref="WB0231XD.IO.TXT.36">Non-Aligned Movement</xr>
           being held in the Serbian and federal capital, Belgrade, in 1961.
        </p>
                    <p id="RS.IS.10">In 1971 a collective federal Presidency, headed by Tito, was established. A new Constitution introduced in 1974 granted the two autonomous provinces within Serbia substantially the same powers, with regard to representation at federal level, as the six republics. Tito died in 1980, and his responsibilities were transferred to the collective federal Presidency and to the Presidium of the SKJ.</p>
                    <p id="RS.IS.11">Inter-ethnic tensions became increasingly evident after Tito’s death. In Kosovo, a state of emergency was declared in 1981, following widespread demonstrations by ethnic Albanian nationalists, in support of demands for the province to be granted the status of a republic within Yugoslavia. Unrest again erupted in 1987, when thousands of Serbs gathered at Kosovo Polje (Fushë Kosovë, the site of a renowned battle between Serbian forces and Ottoman troops in 1389) to protest against harassment by the Albanian majority population, clashing violently with the security forces. The perceived failure of the Serbian and federal leadership to curb Albanian nationalism led to the dismissal in September of Ivan Stambolić as First Secretary of the Savez Komunista Srbije (SKS—League of Communists of Serbia, the Serbian branch of the SKJ). His replacement, Slobodan Milošević, had de­nounced the Serbian leadership’s policy on Kosovo and promised to reverse the emigration of Serbs from the area. Milošević was elected President of the Serbian Presidency in May 1989.</p>
                    <p id="RS.IS.16">In January 1990 the Communists’ constitutional monopoly of power was abolished. After the Serbian authorities dissolved the Kosovo Provincial Assembly in June, a group of 114 ethnic Albanian deputies from the disbanded Assembly attempted to declare Kosovo’s independence from Serbia. A new Serbian Constitution entered into effect in September, including provisions removing the autonomous status of Kosovo (which was renamed Kosovo and Metohija, the name used in 1946-74) and Vojvodina. During November and December 1990 multi-party elections were held in four republics. In Serbia Milošević was re-elected President, overcoming a challenge by Vuk Drašković of the nationalist Srpski Pokret Obnove (SPO—Serbian Renewal Movement). In the Serbian Narodna Skupština (National Assembly—the republican legislature) the Socijalistička Partija Srbije (SPS—Socialist Party of Serbia), led by Milošević, which had succeeded the SKS, won 194 of the 250 seats.</p>
                    <p id="RS.IS.22">
          Tensions between the republics increased in December 1990, when Croatia adopted a new Constitution, giving the republic the right to secede from the federation, while in Slovenia (following earlier constitutional amendments) a referendum endorsed secession. In January 1991 Macedonia declared its sovereignty and right to secede. In February Slovenia formally initiated its process of `dissociation’ from Yugoslavia, and Croatia asserted the primacy of its Constitution and laws over those of the federation. Later that month the self-proclaimed `Serb Autonomous Region of Krajina’ (later part of a self-styled `Republic of the Serb Krajina’—RSK) declared its separation from Croatia and its intention to unite with Serbia. In May the population of Croatia voted in favour of independence at a referendum that was largely boycotted by the Serb minority, and armed clashes between Serbs and Croats ensued. On 25 June Slovenia and Croatia declared independence, after which federal troops attacked a number of targets in Slovenia, resulting in 79 deaths. Following mediation by the European Community (EC—now 
          <xr pageref="Y" ref="WB02047.IO.TXT">European Union—EU</xr>
          ), in July agreement was reached on the immediate cessation of hostilities and on a three-month suspension in the implementation of dissociation by Croatia and Slovenia. The withdrawal of federal troops from Slovenia began almost immediately, but fighting between Serbs and Croats intensified in Croatia. By September Serb forces controlled almost one-third of Croatia, and successive ceasefire agreements failed to end the conflict. In the same month, voters at a referendum in Macedonia approved the establishment of an independent republic.
        </p>
                    <p id="RS.IS.27">In October 1991 Croatia and Slovenia formally ended their association with Yugoslavia, the moratoriums on independence having expired. In December Stipe Mesić resigned as President of the federal Presidency. The federal Prime Minister, Ante Marković, resigned later that month, having been defeated in a vote of no confidence in the bicameral Savezna Skupština (Federal Assembly, comprising the directly elected Veće Građana—Chamber of Citizens—and the indirectly elected Veće Republika—Chamber of Republics).</p>

                         <heading>After the Independence of Croatia and Slovenia</heading>
                         <p>Following the independence of Croatia and Slovenia, Serbia and Montenegro agreed to uphold the Yugoslav state. Macedonia’s representative to the federal Presidency resigned in January 1992. In March Bosnia and Herzegovina declared its independence, the decision having been approved in a referendum that was largely boycotted by the Republic’s Serb population. Later that month a severe escalation in the Bosnian conflict ensued, after the Serb Republic (Republika Srpska) of Bosnia and Herzegovina’ was proclaimed.</p>
                         <p id="RS.IS.30">In April 1992 the Federal Assembly adopted a new Constitution, formally establishing the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, comprising Serbia—including the provinces of Kosovo and Metohija, and Vojvodina—and Montenegro, effectively acknowledging the secession of the four other former Yugoslav republics. In May elections to the Federal Assembly were held, the SPS enjoying considerable success as a result of an opposition boycott. In June Dobrica Ćosić became Yugoslav President, and the collective federal Presi­dency ceased to exist. In that month an alliance of opposition parties formed the Demokratski Pokret Srbije (DEPOS—Democratic Movement of Serbia), led by Drašković.</p>
                         <p id="RS.IS.32">In May 1992 legislative elections, which the Serbian authorities declared to be illegal, were held in Kosovo for an Assembly of the self-proclaimed Republic of Kosovo’. In July the Federal Assembly elected Milan Panić federal Prime Minister. At a conference on the former Yugoslavia, which took place in London, United Kingdom, in August, Panić condemned the practice of `ethnic cleansing’, following the discovery of Serb-run concentration camps in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The federal Minister of Foreign Affairs resigned in September, in protest against Panić’s policies; in November a further three federal ministers resigned.</p>
                         <p id="RS.IS.34">Presidential and parliamentary elections, at both federal and republican levels, took place on 20 December 1992. Ćosić was re-elected federal President. Milošević was re-elected President of Serbia, and the SPS secured 47 of the 138 seats in the Chamber of Citizens. Panić was removed as federal Prime Minister on 29 December, after losing a vote of no confidence. The SPS won 101 seats in the 250-member Serbian National Assembly, while the extreme nationalist Srpska Radikalna Stranka (SRS—Serbian Radical Party) secured 73 seats. In February 1993 a new federal Government, comprising the SPS and the Demokratska Partija Socijalista Crne Gore (DPS—Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro), was established, led by Radoje Kontić. In the same month the SPS formed a new Serbian Government, headed by Nikola Šainović.</p>
                         <p id="RS.IS.36">In June 1993 the Federal Assembly voted to dismiss Ćosić, appointing Zoran Lilić of the SPS as federal President in his place. In October an attempt by the SRS to force a parliamentary vote expressing no confidence in Šainović prompted Milošević to dissolve the National Assembly. In legislative elections, held on 19 December, the SPS obtained 123 seats; DEPOS secured 45 seats and the SRS 39 seats. In February 1994 a new Serbian Government was formed. Mirko Marjanović was appointed Prime Minister, replacing Šainović, who became a federal Deputy Prime Minister. In September a new federal Government, in which Kontić remained Prime Minister, was appointed.</p>
                         <p id="RS.IS.42">In August 1995, following a military offensive, Croatian troops took control of the RSK. The Yugoslav leadership protested strongly against the Croatian action, demanding United Nations (UN) intervention. The Croatian offensive resulted in the exodus of some 150,000 Serb refugees to Yugoslavia and Serb-controlled areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Many were settled in Vojvodina, prompting protests from ethnic Hungarians in that region.</p>
                         <p id="RS.IS.43">In November 1995 peace negotiations were convened in Dayton, Ohio, USA. The conference, at which Milošević represented not only Yugoslavia, but also the Bosnian Serbs, resulted in an agreement on the future territorial and constitutional structure of Bosnia and Herzegovina, including the recognition of Republika Srpska as one of two constituent entities within the country. All UN sanctions against Yugoslavia were suspended later in the month. The SRS denounced the Dayton agreement, which was also criticized by the Demokratska Stranka (DS—Democratic Party), the Demokratska Stranka Srbije (DSS—Democratic Party of Serbia) and the Serbian Orthodox Church.</p>
                         <p id="RS.IS.45">In June 1996 members of the Jugoslovenska Udruzena Levica (JUL—Yugoslav United Left), led by Milošević's wife, Mirjana Marković, were appointed to the Serbian Government. On 3 November elections to municipalities, the Chamber of Citizens and the Montenegrin Skupština (Assembly), were held. At the elections to the 138-member Chamber of Citizens, a coalition led by the SPS and the JUL secured 64 seats, the Zajedno (Together) coalition—including the SPO, the DS and the DSS—took 22, the DPS 20 and the SRS 16. Provisional results for the Serbian municipal elections indicated that Zajedno had obtained control of principal towns, including Belgrade. However, most of the opposition victories were subsequently annulled, precipitating a series of demonstrations, which were violently suppressed by security forces, attracting international criticism. On 11 February 1997 the National Assembly voted to reinstate the annulled results. Later that month Zoran Đinđić, the leader of the DS, was elected Mayor of Belgrade.</p>
                         <p id="RS.IS.50">
            In June 1997 the SPO withdrew from Zajedno. On 25 June Lilić relinquished office as federal President; the Federal Assembly elected Milošević as his successor, and on 23 July he resigned as President of Serbia and was inaugurated as federal President. Following the dissolution of Zajedno, Đinđić urged a boycott of the forthcoming Serbian presidential and legislative elections. At the elections to the National Assembly, held on 21 September, the coalition led by the SPS and the JUL won 110 seats; the SRS received 82 seats and the SPO 45. In the concurrent presidential election Lilić, the candidate of the SPS and JUL-led coalition, received 35.7% of the votes cast, while SRS leader Vojislav Šešelj won 27.3%. In early October SPS and SRS councillors in the Belgrade City Assembly voted to remove Đinđić as Mayor of Belgrade. In the second round of presidential voting on 5 October, Šešelj won 49.1% and Lilić 47.9% of the votes cast. However, since less than 50% of the electorate had participated, the poll was invalid, and a new presidential election was scheduled. In the repeated poll on 7 December, the federal Minister of Foreign Affairs, Milan Milutinović of the SPS, secured 43.7% of the votes cast, while Šešelj received 32.2%. Milutinović, with 59.2% of the votes, defeated Šešelj in the second round, held on 21 December. An official voter turnout of 50.1% was recorded. 
            <xr pageref="Y" ref="OSCE.IO">Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)</xr>
             observers reported severe electoral irregularities. Nevertheless, on 29 December Milutinović was inaugurated as President of Serbia.
          </p>
                         <p id="RS.IS.56">In February 1998 Milutinović reappointed Marjanović as Serbian Prime Minister. Marjanović formed a new Government, comprising representatives of the SRS (including Šešelj as a Deputy Prime Minister), the SPS and the JUL. In May the Federal Assembly adopted a motion expressing no confidence in Kontić. The Federal Assembly approved Milošević’s nomination of Momir Bulatović, the Montenegrin President, as federal Prime Minister, and a new federal Government was established. Milo Đukanović, the Montenegrin Prime Minister, however, declared Bulatović’s Government to be illegitimate, and in June the Montenegrin Assembly withdrew the 20 deputies representing the Republic from the Chamber of Republics. In August a new Montenegrin Government, headed by Filip Vujanović of the DPS, announced that it had suspended links with the federal Government.</p>
                         <p>
            From late 1998 hostilities in Kosovo intensified, and the failure of internationally sponsored negotiations culminated in the aerial bombardment of targets in Serbia and Montenegro during March-June 1999 by 
            <xr pageref="Y" ref="NATO.IO">North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)</xr>
             forces (see 
            <i>Foreign Affairs</i>
            ). In April Drašković was dismissed as Deputy Prime Minister of Yugoslavia, after he publicly opposed Milošević’s refusal to comply with NATO demands. In May the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), based in The Hague, Netherlands, indicted Milošević, together with Milutinović, Šainović, the former Serbian Minister of the Interior, Vlajko Stojiljković, and the Yugoslav Army Chief of Staff, Gen. (retd) Dragoljub Ojdanić, for crimes against humanity. Opposition demonstrations were subsequently organized to demand Milošević’s resignation.
          </p>
                         <p id="RS.IS.58">In February 2000 the federal Minister of Defence, Pavle Bulatović, was assassinated; Milošević subsequently appointed Ojdanić to the post. In July the Federal Assembly approved constitutional amendments removing presidential term limits, providing for direct election to the presidency and the Chamber of Republics, and reducing Montenegro’s constitutional status. Milošević scheduled federal presidential and legislative elections for 24 September. The Montenegrin Government (which had presented demands for the replacement of Yugoslavia with an Association of States’) announced that the republic would not participate in the elections, in protest against the constitutional amendments. In August an alliance of 18 opposition parties, the Demokratska Opozicija Srbije (DOS—the Democratic Opposition of Serbia), presented the leader of the DSS, Vojislav Koštunica, as its candidate to oppose Milošević in the presidential election.</p>

                    <p id="RS.IS.61">Numerous allegations of electoral malpractice and intimidation surrounded the elections to the federal Presidency and legislature on 24 September 2000. Preliminary results indicated that Koštunica had won 48% of the votes cast, less than the 50% required to secure the presidency, while Milošević had won 40%. Milošević demanded that a second round of voting be conducted on 8 October, while Koštunica insisted that he had won the election outright. The international community urged Milošević to accept defeat. Opposition supporters commenced a campaign of peaceful protests in Serbia, in an effort to compel Milošević to resign. On 5 October protesters in Belgrade overpowered security forces and seized control of the parliament building, the state television station and the official news agency, declaring Koštunica President. One day later, Milošević relinquished the presidency. Koštunica was inaugurated as President on 7 October.</p>
                    <p>According to the official election results, Koštunica received 51.7% of the votes cast and Milošević 38.2%; in the concurrent legislative polls to the 138-member Chamber of Citizens, the DOS secured 58 seats, and the SPS 44. After the DOS negotiated an agreement with the SPS in mid-October 2000, the National Assembly was dissolved, and a transitional Government, in which the SPS retained the premiership, was installed, pending legislative elections. Since only about 30% of the Montenegrin electorate had participated in the voting, Koštunica was obliged to form an administration with the only Montenegrin party to be represented in the legislature, the Socijalistička Narodna Partija Crne Gore (SNP—Socialist People’s Party of Montenegro). A member of that party, Zoran Žižić, was nominated as Prime Minister, and a new federal Government, comprising representatives of the DOS and the SNP, was established. Yugoslavia was formally admitted to the UN on 1 November.</p>

                         <p>In the elections to the National Assembly, held on 23 December 2000, the DOS secured 176 of the 250 seats, while the SPS won 37 and the SRS 23. Later that month Đukanović announced proposals for Yugoslavia to become a loose union of two separate states. In January 2001 Đinđić was elected to the Serbian premiership, and a new Serbian Government, comprising members of the DOS, was installed. The Montenegrin pro-independence alliance, led by the DPS, won elections to the Montenegrin Assembly on 22 April. </p>
                         <p>Meanwhile, following a warning by the USA that it would end financial aid to Yugoslavia unless it fully co-operated with the ICTY, Milošević was taken into custody on 1 April 2001, and the federal Public Prosecutor issued a series of charges against him for abuses of power. On 23 June the Serbian Government approved a decree providing for the extradition of Milošević and other indicted war criminals to the ICTY; supporters of Milošević subsequently staged a large protest in Belgrade. Milošević was extradited to the ICTY on 28 June. On the following day Žižić resigned as federal Prime Minister in protest. In July Koštunica appointed Dragiša Pešić of the SNP to the post, and a reorganized federal Government was approved. In August Koštunica withdrew the DSS ministers from the Government, accusing Đinđić’s administration of failing to address widespread crime, after a security agent investigating the connections of state officials to organized crime was killed in Belgrade.</p>
                         <p>In November 2001 Milošević (having been in­dicted for crimes against humanity, including relating to Kosovo, and war crimes perpetrated in Croatia in 1991-92) was charged additionally with genocide, in connection with atrocities perpetrated by Serb forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1992-95. He continued to refuse to recognize the authority of the ICTY, and not guilty’ pleas were submitted on his behalf. His trial commenced in February 2002. In March a Serbian Deputy Prime Minister, Momčilo Perišić (Chief of the General Staff of the Yugoslav Army in 1993-98), was arrested, after military intelligence sources claimed that he had given classified information to a US diplomat. He subsequently resigned from the Government. In June 2002 the DSS withdrew from the National Assembly, in protest against the expulsion of 21 of its deputies. The Serbian Government was subsequently reorganized.</p>
                         <p>Following negotiations on the status of Montenegro, latterly mediated by the EU, the leaders of the Governments of Yugoslavia and its two republics signed a framework agreement on 14 March 2002, providing for the establishment of a State Union, under which the two republics were to have joint foreign and defence ministries, and a joint presidency and legislature. Montenegro was to be permitted to hold a referendum on independence after three years. The agreement was ratified by the legislatures of both republics in April, and by the Federal Assembly in May.</p>
                         <p>Following renewed pressure from the USA, in April 2002 the Federal Assembly approved legislation providing for the extradition of indicted war crimes suspects, and the issue of arrest warrants for those who did not surrender to the ICTY. Shortly afterwards one of the indictees, Stojiljković, committed suicide. Of 10 former Yugoslav state officials indicted, six (including Ojdanić and Šainović) agreed to surrender to the Tribunal. In July Lilić was arrested and extradited to the ICTY, having been subpoenaed as a prosecution witness in the trial of Milošević.</p>
                         <p>The Serbian presidential election was brought forward to 29 September 2002 to allow the extradition of Milutinović to the ICTY. Koštunica won some 30.9% of the votes cast, while Miroljub Labus (the federal Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Trade, who was supported by Đinđić) received 27.4%. A second round of voting took place on 13 October, at which Koštunica secured some 68.4% of the votes. However, the election was declared invalid, as only 44.0% of the electorate participated. In October Đukanović’s pro-independence coalition won an overall majority in elections to the Montenegrin legislature.</p>

                         <p>A presidential poll in Serbia on 8 December 2002 (in which Koštunica won 57.7% of the votes cast) was again annulled, owing to insufficient voter participation. On 30 December Milutinović was replaced as Serbian President, on an interim basis, by the President of the National Assembly, Nataša Mićić, and in January 2003 he was voluntarily transferred to the ICTY. In February 2003 Šešelj surrendered to the ICTY, where he was charged in connection with the forcible removal of the non-Serb population from Vojvodina and various regions of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia in 1991-95.</p>
                         <p>Meanwhile, a new Constitutional Charter providing for the creation of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro was approved by the National Assembly on 27 January 2003, by the Montenegrin Assembly on 29 January and by both chambers of the Federal Assembly on 4 February, when it formally succeeded Yugoslavia. On 25 February the federal and republican legislatures elected a 126-member Skupština Srbije i Crne Gore (Assembly of Serbia and Montenegro), comprising 91 Serbian and 35 Montenegrin deputies, which on 7 March elected a former Speaker of the Montenegrin legislature, Svetozar Marović, unopposed as President of the State Union. The joint assembly approved a five-member Council of Ministers, chaired by the President, on 18 March.</p>
                         <p>On 12 March 2003 Đinđić was shot dead in Belgrade. Mićić imposed a state of emergency in Serbia (which remained in force until April), and on 18 March the National Assembly approved the nomination of former federal Minister of Internal Affairs Zoran Živković to succeed Đinđić as Serbian Prime Minister. At the end of March security forces discovered the remains of Ivan Stambolić, who had been abducted in August 2000. The Serbian authorities issued an international arrest warrant for Mirjana Marković and her son, in connection with his killing; Milošević was also charged with involvement. In April 2003 the Assembly of Serbia and Montenegro voted in favour of extending co-operation with the ICTY. In May Vujanović was elected President of Montenegro; he subsequently pledged to hold a referendum on independence within three years. In October the ICTY issued indictments against four senior Serbian military and security officials, including the Chief of General Staff of the Yugoslav Army in 2000-02, Col-Gen. (retd) Nebojša Pavković, for war crimes perpetrated in Kosovo.</p>

            In November 2003 two small parties withdrew from the DOS coalition, ending its parliamentary majority. On 16 November a further presidential poll in Serbia (at which the acting leader of the SRS, Tomislav Nikolić, secured 47.9% of the votes) was again declared invalid. In December the trial began of 36 suspects charged in connection with Đinđić’s assassination (15 of them—including Milorad `Legija’ Ulemek, the leader of an organized criminal group and a prominent member of a paramilitary unit of Milošević’s regime—
            <i>in absentia</i>
            ). At elections to the National Assembly, held on 28 December, the SRS secured 82 seats, the DSS 53 seats, the DS 37 seats, a newly emerged reformist grouping known as G17 Plus 34 seats, an alliance of the SPO and Nova Srbija (NS—New Serbia) 22 seats, and the SPS 22 seats. Following inter-party discussions, the DSS formed a minority coalition with G17 Plus and the SPO-NS alliance. On 4 February 2004 Dragan Maršićanin, deputy leader of the DSS, was elected President of the National Assembly, replacing Mićić as Serbia’s acting President. In order to end the impasse, the National Assembly abolished the minimum rate of participation in republican presidential elections. A new republican Council of Ministers, headed by Koštunica, was formed in March. In April the Assembly of Serbia and Montenegro approved a reorganization of the State Union’s Council of Ministers; Drašković received the foreign affairs portfolio, while Prvoslav Davinić of G17 Plus replaced Boris Tadić, the leader of the DS, as Minister of Defence. Ulemek surrendered to the Serbian authorities in May. (In July 2005 Ulemek was sentenced to 40 years’ imprisonment for involvement in the murder of Stambolić; the head of Milošević's secret service, Radomir Marković, received a 15-year term, while six former secret service officers received custodial terms.)

                         <p>In the new election to the Serbian presidency on 13 June 2004 Nikolić secured 30.1% of the votes cast, while Tadić won 27.7%. In a second round of voting on 27 June, Tadić was elected President, receiving 54.0% of the votes, and he was inaugurated on 17 July.</p>
                         <p>Meanwhile, representatives of the international community accused the Serbian authorities of aiding the continuing evasion from the Tribunal of former Bosnian Serb military commander Gen. (retd) Ratko Mladić (who had been indicted in 1995 on charges that included genocide). However, following the surrender of further war crimes suspects mediated by the Koštunica Government, notably including that of Pavković, in April 2005 the European Commission indicated that sufficient progress had been made for Serbia and Montenegro to commence negotiations on a Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU; these opened in October. On 11 March 2006 Milošević died while in custody at the ICTY. Negotiations on the SAA with the EU were suspended on 3 May, after Serbia failed to meet a deadline for Mladić’s extradition to the ICTY. </p>

                         <p>In February 2006 it was announced that a referendum on Montenegro’s secession from the State Union would take place on 21 May. At the referendum held in Montenegro on that day, some 55.5% of votes were cast in favour of independence, narrowly exceeding the threshold of 55% stipulated by the EU. Montenegro declared independence on 3 June, and two days later the National Assembly officially declared Serbia the successor state to the State Union of Serbia and Monte­negro. In mid-June the Serbian Government recognized Montenegro’s independence, and the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the two countries signed a protocol on the establishment of diplomatic relations on 22 June.</p>
                         <p>In July 2006 the trial of six former Serbian officials began at the ICTY: Milutinović, Šainović, Ojdanić, Pavković, Vladimir Lazarević and Gen. (retd) Sreten Lukić (the former head of police in Kosovo) were charged with crimes relating to human rights violations committed in Kosovo. On 30 September the National Assembly unanimously adopted a new draft Constitution. Following its approval by 53.0% of votes cast in a national referendum on 29 October, the new Constitution entered into effect on 8 November. In December an SPS congress elected Ivica Dačić as party leader.</p>
                         <p>
            At the elections to the National Assembly on 21 January 2007, the SRS obtained 81 seats, while the DS secured 64 seats, a DSS-led alliance 47 seats, G17 Plus 19 seats, the SPS 16 seats, and a reformist alliance led by the Liberalno-demokratska Partija (LDP—Liberal Democratic Party) 15 seats. On 11 May Tadić finally announced that a coalition agreement had been reached between G17 Plus and an alliance of the DS, the DSS and NS, and that he had nominated Koštunica for a second term as Prime Minister. Four days later the National Assembly approved the formation of a coalition Government, which included the new position of Minister of Kosovo and Metohija. In the same month the Belgrade Special Court for Organized Crime convicted Ulemek and 11 others (five 
            <i>in absentia</i>
            ) of the assassination of Đinđić; Ulemek received a further sentence of 40 years’ imprisonment. In early June the European Commission invited Serbia to resume negotiations on an SAA, following the arrest in Bosnia and Herzegovina of a former Bosnian Serb army officer, Zdravko Tolimir. 
          </p>
                         <p>In December 2007 the National Assembly approved legislation allowing a pre-term presidential election to be scheduled for early 2008. At the first round of the election on 20 January, Nikolić won 40.0% of the votes cast and Tadić 35.4%. In the second round, held on 3 February, Tadić was re-elected to the presidency, with 50.3% of the votes, narrowly defeating Nikolić. Around 67% of the electorate participated. Tadić was inaugurated on 15 February.</p>
                         <p>Kosovo’s declaration of independence on 17 February 2008 presented a further obstacle to prospects for Serbia’s EU integration. Koštunica, who opposed the EU’s decision to establish a police and justice mission for Kosovo (see Kosovo), resigned from the premiership on 8 March. On 13 March Tadić dissolved the National Assembly, scheduling legislative elections for 11 May. On 29 April the EU signed the SAA with Serbia; however, its implementation was suspended until EU member states agreed unanimously on Serbia’s full co-operation with the ICTY.</p>
                         <p>At the legislative elections on 11 May 2008, a DS-led electoral coalition of parties supporting EU integration formed by Tadić, Za Evropsku Srbiju (For a European Serbia), won 38.4% of the votes cast and 102 seats. The SRS secured 29.4% of the votes (78 seats), and the DSS-NS alliance 11.6% of the votes (30 seats); a coalition of the SPS and the Partija Ujedinjenih Penzionera Srbije (PUPS—Party of United Pensioners of Serbia) obtained 7.6% (20 seats).</p>
                         <p>On 7 July 2008 a new Government, comprising representatives of the DS- and SPS-led alliances, narrowly secured approval in the National Assembly. A former Minister of Finance, Mirko Cvetković of the DS, became Prime Minister, while Ivica Dačić, the SPS leader since late 2006, became First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Internal Affairs. Meanwhile, in June 2008 the Supreme Court of Cassation sentenced Radomir Marković and Ulemek to 40 years’ imprisonment and imposed lengthy custodial terms on five former state security and special police officers for the attempted assassination of Drašković and the killing of four of his associates in 1999. On 21 July 2008 Tadić announced that Serbian security officers had apprehended former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadžić, the most senior war crimes suspect indicted by the ICTY, in Belgrade (where he had resided for several years under an assumed identity). Karadžić’s arrest and subsequent extradition to the ICTY on 30 July was welcomed by the international community.</p>
                         <p>In September 2008 the National Assembly ratified the SAA, its implementation remaining conditional on full co-operation with the ICTY. Nikolić, who had accepted ratification of the SAA, resigned as acting leader of the SRS, owing to opposition to the agreement from Šešelj; in October Nikolić formed a breakaway organ­ization, the Srpska Napredna Stranka (SNS—Serbian Progressive Party). In February 2009 the ICTY sentenced Šainović, Pavković and Milan Lukić to 22 years’ imprisonment, while Lazarević and Ojdanić each received terms of 15 years, on charges relating to the killing and forced deportation of Kosovo Albanian civilians; Milutinović was acquitted. In the same month the trial of Šešelj (who had repeatedly staged hunger strikes in protest at the proceedings) was suspended, owing to claims of witness intimidation. In July the ICTY convicted Šešelj of being in contempt of the Tribunal, sentencing him to 15 months’ im­prisonment.</p>
                         <p>In November 2009 it was announced that Serbia had met EU requirements for the abolition of visa requirements, with effect from late December. On 22 December Serbia submitted an official application to join the EU. In March 2010 the National Assembly adopted a resolution, submitted by the parties of the governing coalition, condemning the massacre of some 7,000-8,000 Bosniak (Bosnian Muslim) males by Bosnian Serb forces at Srebrenica in July 1995.</p>
                         <p>On 26 May 2011 the Serbian authorities arrested Mladić in a village in northern Serbia, where he had resided under an assumed identity. The SRS organized a demonstration in Belgrade to denounce the arrest. Mladić was transferred to the ICTY on 31 May. The arrest of Goran Hadžić, the final major war crimes suspect to be indicted by the ICTY, was announced by the Serbian authorities on 20 July. In September the ICTY convicted Perišić, sentencing him to 27 years’ imprisonment (although in 2013 the ICTY appeals chamber overturned the conviction, on the grounds that Perišić was not responsible for war crimes committed by the army of Republika Srpska). In accordance with recommendations by the European Commission, EU heads of state and government officially approved Serbia’s candidate status on 1 March 2012.</p>

                         <p>In March 2012 the Government scheduled legislative and local elections for 6 May. Tadić resigned as President on 5 April, prior to an early presidential election (to take place concurrently), at which he was to seek a second term. On 6 May Pokrenimo Srbiju (Let’s Get Serbia Moving), a grouping led by the SNS, secured 73 seats in the National Assembly, with 24.0% of the votes cast, while the DS-led coalition, Izbor za Bolji Život (Choice for a Better Life), received 67 seats, with 22.1% of the votes; Dačić’s alliance of the SPS, the PUPS and Jedinstvena Srbija (United Serbia—JS) obtained 44 seats (14.5% of the votes). At the presidential election, contested by 12 candidates, Tadić received 25.3% and Nikolić 25.1% of the votes. The overall voter turnout in the parliamentary and presidential elections was estimated at about 57.9%. The DS and the SPS subsequently reached an agreement to support Tadić in the second round of the presidential election. Nevertheless, on 20 May Nikolić secured 49.5% of the votes cast, defeating Tadić. Nikolić was inaugurated as President on 31 May.</p>
                         <p>On 28 June 2012 Nikolić nominated Dačić to form a new administration. The National Assembly on 27 July approved the formation of a new Government, headed by Dačić (who retained the internal affairs portfolio), principally comprising members of the SPS, the SNS, the URS, the PUPS and the Socijaldemokratska Partija Srbije (SDP—Social Democratic Party of Serbia). The Deputy President of the SNS, Aleksandar Vučić, was appointed First Deputy Prime Minister, responsible for Defence, Security, and the Fight against Corruption and Crime, and Minister of Defence, while the leader of the Ujedinjeni Regioni Srbije (URS—United Regions of Serbia), Mlađan Dinkić, was appointed Minister of Finance and the Economy. Vučić was elected as President of the SNS in September. In November Tadić was replaced as leader of the DS by the Mayor of Belgrade, Dragan Đilas.</p>
                         <p>On 26 April 2013 the National Assembly adopted an accord which had been initialled by Dačić and the Prime Minister of Kosovo earlier that month (see Kosovo). On 28 June the European Council officially endorsed the opening of EU accession negotiations with Serbia; however, commencement of the negotiations was deferred. The SAA entered into effect in September, following completion of the ratification process.</p>
                         <p>At the beginning of August 2013, meanwhile, Dačić expelled the URS from the ruling coalition, thereby removing Dinkić as Minister of Finance and the Economy; several other ministers subsequently resigned from the Government. The Pokret Socijalista (PS—Movement of Socialists), formed by former members of the SPS, joined the new Government and on 2 September the National Assembly approved a new seven-party coalition administration led by Dačić. Later in September the City Assembly of Belgrade adopted a motion of no confidence to dismiss the city’s Mayor, DS President Đilas.</p>
                         <p>EU membership negotiations officially began on 21 January 2014. However, trade unions organized mass protests in Belgrade and strike action in protest against planned austerity reforms. Following the Government’s decision to withdraw the draft legislation, on 25 January the Minister of the Economy resigned. On 29 January President Nikolić dissolved the National Assembly and scheduled early legislative elections for 16 March in order to strengthen the mandate of the Government in its reform agenda.</p>
                         <p>The SNS secured an overall majority at the elections to the National Assembly on 16 March 2014, its five-party coalition, Aleksandar Vučić—Budućnost u Koju Verujemo (A Future We Believe In), taking some 48.4% of the votes cast and 158 seats. The SPS-led coalition received 13.5% of the votes and 44 seats, the DS list led by Đilas 6.0% and 19 seats, and the alliance led by Tadić 5.7% and 18 seats. The official rate of participation was 53.1%. The SNS secured 43.6% of the votes cast in the election to Belgrade’s City Assembly; Siniša Mali, the candidate nominated by the SNS, became Mayor. After both the DSS and the URS failed to obtain parliamentary representation, Koštunica and Dinkić resigned as their respective leaders. On 27 April the National Assembly approved a new coalition Government led by Vučić. Dačić remained in a senior post, as First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>
                         <p>In November 2014 Šešelj was provisionally released from detention by the ICTY, after a cancer diagnosis. Although the ICTY appeals chamber on 30 March 2015 ordered that Šešelj be returned to custody, the Serbian authorities refused to return him to the Hague on grounds of his ill health.</p>

                         <p>On 17 January 2016 Prime Minister Vučić announced that pre-term legislative elections would take place on 24 April, with the stated aim of securing a further mandate for his economic reform programme, and the National Assembly was accordingly dissolved. In February the PUPS withdrew from its alliance with the SPS, and signed a pre-election agreement with the SNS, which was joined by several other parties, including the NS, the SPO and the PS, to form a coalition, Srbija Pobeđuje (SP—Serbia Prevails). The DS, Tadić’s Socialdemokratska Stranka (SDS—Social Democratic Party) and the LDP became the principal elements of a newly formed electoral coalition, Za Pravednu Srbiju (ZPS—For A Just Serbia).</p>
                         <p>The Government accused the ICTY of bias following its verdict against Karadžić, who on 24 March 2016 was found guilty of 10 of 11 charges against him, including one of genocide relating to the Srebrenica massacre, and sentenced to a prison term of 40 years (subsequently increased to life imprisonment). On 31 March the ICTY found Šešelj (who remained in Belgrade) not guilty of the nine charges against him.</p>
                         <p>In elections to the National Assembly held on 24 April 2016 (with polls repeated in a number of constituencies on 4 May), Vučić’s SP alliance obtained 131 seats, thereby obtaining a narrow parliamentary majority, having obtained 48.3% of the votes cast. An alliance of the SPS and JS was placed second, with 11.0% and 29 seats, ahead of the SRS, with 8.1% and 22 seats. The rate of participation was 56.1%. Local elections were conducted on the same day. On 23 May 2016 President Nikolić awarded Prime Minister Vučić a mandate to form a government, and his coalition administration was approved by a vote of 163 deputies in favour in the National Assembly on 11 August. Eight new members were appointed, including business executive Ana Brnabić as Minister of Public Administration and Local Self-Government.</p>

                         <p>In mid-February 2017 the SNS officially nominated premier Vučić as the party candidate for the forthcoming presidential election, after which Nikolić announced his decision not to seek a further term in office. Vučić was elected to the presidency in the first round on 2 April, with 55.1% of the votes cast, defeating 10 other candidates. A participation rate of 54.3% of the electorate was recorded. Vučić’s victory precipitated a mass protest in Belgrade on 3 April, followed by demonstrations in around 15 other major cities. The election results were annulled in 11 municipalities owing to allegations of malpractice, and polls were repeated there later in April.</p>
                         <p>Meanwhile, popular protests of up to 15,000 people continued daily in Belgrade and other cities; the campaign was styled as a `Protest Protiv Diktature’ (`Protest Against Dictatorship’), against the leadership of Vučić, who was accused of eroding democracy and press freedom. On 21 April 2017 the Electoral Commission officially declared Vučić to be the winner of the presidential election. Vučić took office as President on 31 May, amid further large protests in Belgrade. On 16 June Vučić announced the nomination of Brnabić, an independent, as the next Prime Minister. Her new Government, principally comprising members of the SNS, the SPS, the SDP and the PUPS, was approved by 157 deputies in the National Assembly on 29 June. Only three new government members were appointed, and a Ministry of European Integration was created.</p>
                         <p>
             Mladić was convicted by the ICTY on 22 November 2017 on 10 of 11 charges, including one of genocide relating to acts against the Bosniak population of Srebrenica, and sentenced to life imprisonment. Following appeal hearings, on 11 April 2018 the successor body to the ICTY, the Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals (MICT), partially overturned the 2016 acquittal of Šešelj, sentencing him 
            <i>in absentia</i>
             to 10 years’ imprisonment on three counts of crimes against humanity (he had already spent over 10 years in pre-trial detention at The Hague). In May, as discussions on a new loan arrangement with the International Monetary Fund began, Minister of Finance Dušan Vujović tendered his resignation. He was replaced by Mali of the SNS, the hitherto Mayor of Belgrade.
          </p>
                         <p>On 23 November 2018 an opposition leader and member of a newly formed grouping of opposition parties, Savez za Srbiju (SzS—Alliance for Serbia—created by former DS leader Đilas), was assaulted at an opposition meeting in the southern town of Kruševac. An anti-Government rally was staged in Belgrade on 8 December, with protesters accusing the authorities of condoning political violence. Protest rallies, numbering several thousand, to demand the resignation of President Vučić, were subsequently organized weekly by civil activists, in co-operation with SzS, in Belgrade, and from January 2019 also in other major cities. The protest movement escalated on 16 March, when demonstrators surrounded the presidential offices, and briefly occupied the headquarters of state broadcaster Radiotelevizija Srbije in protest at biased media coverage. The SNS organized a large pro-Government rally in Belgrade on 19 April, which was attended by Republika Srpska leader Milorad Dodik. Weekly anti-Government rallies subsequently continued in Belgrade and other major towns.</p>

                         <p>On 15 March 2020, after cases of COVID-19 had been confirmed in Serbia, President Vučić declared a state of emergency, which included a 12-hour curfew. On the following day the legislative elections, which had been scheduled to take place on 26 April, were postponed. The state of emergency and curfew were lifted on 6 May, and the legislative and local elections were rescheduled for 21 June.</p>
                         <p>
            Meanwhile, after SzS and all other major opposition parties confirmed their boycott of the forthcoming elections, in protest at the perceived absence of democratic conditions, in February 2020 the National Assembly approved a proposal by Vučić that the threshold for representation be reduced from 5% to 3%. The postponed elections proceeded on 21 June; the Electoral Commission ordered that voting be repeated on 1 July at 234 polling stations, following complaints of irregularities. The SNS-led electoral alliance, Aleksandar Vučić—Za Našu Decu (Aleksandar Vučić—For Our Children), secured a majority, with 188 of the 250 seats and 63.0% of the votes. An alliance of the SPS and JS received 32 seats, with 10.8% of the votes. Owing to the extensive opposition boycott and ongoing pandemic, voter turnout, at 48.9%, was the lowest rate recorded since 2000.

            In the local elections, the SNS also secured a majority in most city and municipal assemblies.
          </p>
                         <p>Amid a surge in cases of COVID-19, in early July 2020 Vučić announced the reimposition of restrictions, precipitating violent protests. On the following day Vučić withdrew plans to reinstate a curfew. However, protests against the Government’s management of the COVID-19 crisis continued in Belgrade and other major cities for several days, resulting in clashes with police.</p>
                         <p>In early October 2020 Vučić nominated Brnabić for a further term as Prime Minister. Vučić announced on 20 October that the next government would have a shorter mandate, to April 2022, when further legislative elections would be held concurrently with a presidential election and local polls. Dačić was elected President of the National Assembly two days later. Brnabić’s new Government, which included several principal ministers of her previous administration, was endorsed by 227 deputies in the National Assembly on 28 October. Branko Ružić of the SPS succeeded Dačić as First Deputy Prime Minister, also taking responsibility for the portfolio of Education, Science and Technological Development.</p>

                         <p>On 7 June 2021 the National Assembly voted to begin a procedure to amend provisions in the Constitution relating to the judicial system, in accordance with requirements for EU accession. At the end of November the National Assembly adopted a decision to schedule a referendum seeking endorsement of the constitutional amendments for 16 January 2022. Meanwhile, controversial new legislation abolishing the 50% participation rate required for a referendum to be considered valid was adopted by the National Assembly and signed by Vučić on 25 November. On the following day legislation on expropriation that would facilitate the state’s acquisition of private land was also approved by the National Assembly, despite environmental and opposition concerns that the law would be used to advance environmentally damaging mining projects, notably a lithium mine planned by multinational Rio Tinto. After continued large-scale protests, on 8 December the Government announced that it had withdrawn the expropriation law, which Vučić returned to the legislature for amendment, and offered to propose amendments to the referendum law. On 20 January 2022 the Government ceded to pressure and revoked Rio Tinto’s lithium exploration permits. At the referendum on 16 January, meanwhile, 60.2% of votes were cast in favour of changes to the Constitution (relating to the judicial reforms), although the participation rate was only 30.7%. The proposed constitutional changes were officially adopted by the National Assembly on 9 February.</p>
                         <p>On 15 February 2022 Vučić adopted a decree on the dissolution of the National Assembly and scheduled parliamentary elections for 3 April (when a presidential election was also to take place). Meanwhile, in early February a newly reconstituted opposition coalition, Ujedinjena za Pobedu Srbija (UZPS—United for the Victory of Serbia), selected a retired army general and member of the centre-right Narodna Stranka (People’s Party), Zdravko Ponoš, as its presidential candidate. Vučić secured re-election in the first round of presidential voting (which was contested by a total of eight candidates) on 3 April 2022, with 58.6% of votes cast, according to official results. Ponoš was the second-placed candidate, with 18.4% of the votes. The SNS-led coalition, Aleksandar Vučić—Zajedno Možemo Sve (Aleksandar Vučić—Together We Can Do Everything), also won 43.0% of the votes and 120 seats in the elections to the National Assembly, while UZPS received 13.7% of the votes and 38 seats, and the SPS-led coalition attracted 11.4% and 31 seats. Several other blocs also secured representation. A voter turnout of 58.6% was recorded in the presidential and legislative elections. SNS-led coalitions also performed well in the concurrent local elections in 12 municipalities and two cities (including Belgrade). Following a decision by the Electoral Commission, on 16 and 28 April polls were repeated in 89 constituencies nationwide and in four to the Belgrade Assembly, owing to irregularities. An OSCE observer mission reported that the government parties had benefited from disproportionate access to media and to campaign funds, and widespread pressure on public employees. Vučić was inaugurated for a further presidential term on 31 May.</p>
                         <p>Vučić nominated Brnabić to serve a further term as Prime Minister on 27 August 2022. On 26 October, shortly before the expiry of a constitutional deadline, the National Assembly (with 157 votes in favour) approved the establishment of a new SNS-led coalition Government formed by Brnabić. SPS leader Dačić returned to government as First Deputy Prime Minister responsible for Foreign Policy and Security, and Minister of Foreign Affairs. Mali was reappointed as Minister of Finance and became a Deputy Prime Minister, while Maja Gojković of the SNS retained the culture portfolio and was also appointed as a Deputy Prime Minister. Miloš Vučević, the SNS Vice-President and former Mayor of Novi Sad, was appointed as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence, and Bratislav Gašić, an independent and hitherto head of the Security Intelligence Agency, as Minister of Internal Affairs. Tomislav Žigmanov, the leader of the Demokratski Savez Hrvata u Vojvodini (Democratic Alliance of Croats in Vojvodina), was appointed as Minister for Human and Minority Rights and Social Dialogue.</p>
                         <p>The Government announced three days of official mourning, following a shooting by a student at a school in Belgrade on 3 May 2023, in which 10 people were killed; protesters subsequently gathered at the education ministry building to demand the resignation of officials. On the following day at least eight people were killed in an attack by a gunman in the village of Dubona, south of Belgrade. The Minister of Education, Branko Ružić, resigned on 7 May. On the following day opposition parties began to organize protest rallies, attended by some 50,000 people, in Belgrade and other major cities. On 27 May Vučić resigned as leader of the SNS, as a concession to the opposition; he was succeeded by his ally Vučević. However, mass protests in Belgrade continued to demand his resignation as President. The Minister of the Economy, Rade Basta, was dismissed in July. The various opposition parties organizing the protest campaign, including the DS, the Narodni Pokret Srbije (People’s Movement of Serbia), the Stranka Slobode i Pravde (Party of Freedom and Justice), led by prominent opposition figure Đilas, and the Zeleno-Levi Front (Green-Left Front), formed a coalition known as Srbija Protiv Nasilja (SPN—Serbia Against Violence), which was formalized as an electoral alliance in October.</p>
                         <p>Meanwhile, on 31 May 2023 the former head of the State Security Directorate in the Milošević regime, Jovica Stanišić, and his former deputy were sentenced by the MICT to 15 years’ imprisonment on appeal for war crimes committed by Serbian units in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia in 1992.</p>

                         <heading>Recent Developments: Further Pre-term Elections</heading>
                         <p>Following the continued protests and demands from opposition parties, on 1 November 2023 Vučić dissolved the National Assembly and scheduled early legislative elections for 17 December, together with elections to the Belgrade City Assembly and 64 other municipal bodies. On that day the SNS-led Aleksandar Vučić—Srbija Ne Sme Da Stane (Aleksandar Vučić—Serbia Must Not Stop) coalition secured 46.8% of the votes cast and 129 seats, gaining a narrow majority in the National Assembly, while the SPN secured 23.7% of the votes and 65 seats, the SPS-led Ivica Dačić—Premijer Srbije (Ivica Dačić—Prime Minister of Serbia) coalition 6.6% and 18 seats, the right-wing Nacionalno Demokratska Alternativa (National Democratic Alternative) coalition led by the Nova Demokratska Stranka Srbij (New Democratic Party of Serbia) 5.0% and 13 seats, and the newly created, populist Mi—Glas iz Naroda (We—The Voice from the People) 4.7% and 13 seats. A voter turnout of 58.8% was recorded. At the elections to Belgrade City Assembly, the SNS-led coalition took 49 seats and the SPN 43 seats. The SNS-led coalition retained control of most of the contested municipalities. OSCE observers stated that the campaign had been marred by media bias and the misuse of public resources, and reported irregularities during the voting process. Large protests to demand the annulment of the results, organized by the SPN, began at the Election Commission offices on 18 December, continuing during that month. Voting was subsequently repeated at eight polling stations, but Vučić rejected demands for an international investigation into the alleged irregularities (which included the organized transport of voters to Belgrade from other regions). On 24 December a group of demonstrators attempted to storm the building of the Belgrade City Assembly, resulting in violent clashes with the police; Vučić denounced the action as an attempt to overthrow the Government. The Electoral Commission announced the final election results on 12 January 2024, and the DS lodged a formal complaint at the alleged malpractice. However, on 3 March it was announced that new elections would be held to the Belgrade City Assembly, following its failure to reach a quorum; they were scheduled for 2 June.</p>
                         <!-- https://www.srbija.gov.rs/vest/en/217560/election-commission-announces-final-results-of-parliamentary-elections.php-->
                         <p>The outgoing Prime Minister, Brnabić, was elected President of the National Assembly on 20 March 2024. At the end of that month Vučić designated SNS President Vučević as the new Prime Minister. Meanwhile, the SPN had effectively disbanded, owing to disagreement among its constituent parties over whether to boycott the repeated elections in Belgrade. Vučević announced the formation of a new Government on 30 April. Marko Đurić, Serbia’s ambassador to the USA, was awarded the foreign affairs portfolio, while Dačić was transferred to the post of Minister of Internal Affairs, with Gašić succeeding Vučević as Minister of Defence. The new administration included two pro-Russian politicians under US sanctions: former longstanding minister and director of the Security Intelligence Agency Aleksandar Vulin, who became a Deputy Prime Minister, and SNP leader Nenad Popović (who was believed to have connections with senior Russian officials) as Minister without Portfolio. Vučević’s Government was approved by a vote of 152 to 61 in the National Assembly on 2 May.</p>

                    <heading>Vojvodina</heading>
                    <p>
          The Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, comprising slightly more than one-quarter of the territory of Serbia, had formerly been a Hungarian margraviate or banat (frontier province), in which the Habsburgs had settled other ethnic groups to defend Christendom against the Ottomans. In the 19th century the Habsburgs created a province of Serbian Vojvodina, seeking to satisfy the aspirations of Serb nationalists. At the end of the Second World War more Serbs settled there and became the dominant ethnic group. 
          <!--DH 1945 is seemingly correct; status was *confirmed* by the Federal Constitution of 1946-->
          Vojvodina’s status of Autonomous Province, awarded in 1945, was effectively removed by the 1990 Serbian Constitution, which was confirmed by the April 1992 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. However, Vojvodina retained a provincial Assembly.
        </p>
                    <p>During the mid-&#160;and late 1990s opposition increased among the inhabitants of Vojvodina to the province’s domination by the Serbian authorities. In 1996 some 17 political parties and other associations signed a manifesto demanding the restoration of provincial autonomy, precipitating a campaign in support of the amendment of the 1990 Serbian and 1992 Yugoslav Constitutions. Tensions increased in May 2000, following the assassination of the President of the provincial Executive Council (administration), Boško Perošević. Elections to the Vojvodina Assembly took place on 24 September and 8 October. The provincial section of the opposition DOS secured 71.7% of the votes cast, and 86 of the 120 elective seats. </p>
                    <p>Following the failure of the Koalicija Vojvodina (Coalition Vojvodina) to secure representation in the National Assembly in early legislative elections on 28 December 2003, its main constituent party, the Vajdasági Magyar Szövetség (VMSz—Alliance of Vojvodina Hungarians), announced its withdrawal from the coalition. Serb nationalist violence in Vojvodina, with frequent attacks against members of the Croat and Hungarian communities, subsequently increased.</p>
                    <p>At elections to the 120-member Vojvodina Assembly on 19 September and 3 October 2004 the SRS secured 36 seats, the DS 34 seats and the VMSz 11 seats; Bojan Pajtić of the DS subsequently became President of the Executive Council. In March 2005 the Executive Council adopted proposals (which were subsequently presented to the Serbian Government) on the province's future constitutional status, providing for what was termed full autonomy. Following the dissolution of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro on 5 June 2006, the new Serbian Constitution granted Vojvodina powers of financial autonomy.</p>
                    <p>On 11 and 25 May 2008 elections to the Vojvodina Assembly took place concurrently with national elections. A DS-led alliance secured 65 of the 120 Assembly seats. Support for the SRS was substantially reduced, from 36 to 24 seats, while a coalition led by the VMSz won nine seats. In July the Assembly re-elected Pajtić President of the Executive Council.</p>
                    <p>On 15 October 2008 the Vojvodina Assembly adopted the draft of a new Statute of Vojvodina (the constitutive act of the province) by 89 votes, and submitted it for the consent of the National Assembly. Assembly deputies belonging to the SRS, the DSS and NS strenuously opposed the draft, particularly proposals that the Executive Council be renamed the Provincial Government and that the Assembly be granted the authority to adopt `provincial legal acts’. In December 2009 the National Assembly adopted the Statute of Vojvodina, which duly entered into force on 1 January 2010.</p>
                    <p>Elections to the Vojvodina Assembly took place on 6 and 20 May 2012. A DS-led alliance obtained 57 of the 120 seats in the Assembly, while an SNS-led coalition won 22 seats. Bojan Pajtić of the DS subsequently formed a coalition Government comprising representatives of the DS, the Liga Socijaldemokrata Vojvodine (League of Social Democrats of Vojvodina) and the VMSz.</p>
                    <p>
          In July 2012 Serbia’s Constitutional Court ruled provisions of the self-proclaimed Statute on Vojvodina to be unconstitutional, including that naming the provincial administrative centre, Novi Sad, as the capital of the province. Tensions between the provincial and republican authorities subsequently intensified. In April 2013 around 30,000 protesters from across Serbia attended a rally outside the offices of the Vojvodina Executive Council in Novi Sad to protest against what they claimed was support for separatism in a recently published draft Declaration on the Protection of Constitutional and Legal Rights of Vojvodina, and to demand the resignation of the provincial authorities. None the less, the Declaration, which was intended to protect the autonomous status of the province, was adopted by the Vojvodina Assembly in May. In December the Constitutional Court ordered that 40 provisions in the Statute be brought into compliance with the Constitution within six months. Following revisions by a parliamentary group, an amended Statute in which, 
          <i>inter alia</i>
          , autonomous designations such as `government’ and `capital’ of the province were removed, was adopted by the Vojvodina Assembly in May 2014.
        </p>
                    <p>On 22 March 2016 elections to the Vojvodina Assembly were scheduled, concurrently with pre-term national elections (see above), for 24 April. The elections represented a substantial defeat for the erstwhile provincial authorities, and resulted in a substantial strengthening of the parties in the national Government. The SNS-led alliance won a narrow majority of seats (63) in the Vojvodina Assembly, obtaining 44.5% of the votes cast. An alliance of the SPS and JS was placed second, with 8.9% and 12 seats, ahead of the SRS, with 7.7% and 10 seats. A four-party coalition led by Pajtić, including the DS and NS, obtained just 7.2% and 10 seats. The rate of participation was 55.7%. On 20 June Igor Mirović of the SNS was elected Chairman of the Government of Vojvodina; the new coalition Provincial Government principally comprised members of the SNS, the SPS and the VMSz. </p>
                    <p>Elections to the Vojvodina Assembly on 21 June 2020 were boycotted by the main opposition parties, together with the elections at national level, and resulted in an increased majority for the SNS-led coalition, Za Našu Decu (For Our Children), which secured 61.6% of the votes cast and 76 seats. A SPS-JS alliance obtained 11.2% of the votes and 13 seats, and the VMSz 9.3% and 11 seats. A voter participation rate of 50.3% was recorded. On 29 October the Assembly approved the establishment of a new Government, again headed by Mirović, and comprising representatives of the SNS and its allied parties, the SPS and the VMSz.</p>
                    <p>Following the death of the President of the Assembly, VMSz Chairman István Pásztor, on 6 November 2023 Momo Čolaković of the PUPS (a member of the SNS-led coalition) was elected to the post. After President Vučić announced early legislative elections for 17 December, on 16 November the Assembly voted to dissolve itself and hold concurrent elections. On 17 December the local SNS-led Srbija Ne Sme Da Stane coalition won 48.8% of the votes cast and 66 seats (representing a loss of 10 seats), while the newly created SPN (see above) secured 22.6% and 30 seats, and the VMSz 6.7% and nine seats. A voter turnout of 59.0% was recorded. At the national elections, the VMSz secured six seats in the National Assembly. On 8 May 2024 a new Government was formed, led by Maja Gojković, previously an SNS Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Culture and Information in the national Government.</p>

                         <p id="RS.IS.76">In 1996 an ethnic Albanian paramilitary movement, the Ushtria Çlirimtare e Kosovës (UÇK—Kosovo Liberation Army), began to launch attacks against Serbian special forces operating in Kosovo. In early 1998 the USA and the EU con­demned the violent measures taken by the Serbian security forces to suppress the UÇK, while also criticizing the activities of the movement, which had announced its intention to achieve independence for the province through armed resistance. A `Contact Group’, comprising the UK, France, Germany, Italy, the Russian Federation and the USA, envisaged the imposition of further sanctions against Yugoslavia, unless the Serbian authorities acceded to a number of demands, including the withdrawal of security forces from Kosovo and the initiation of negotiations regarding the future status of Kosovo. In March the UN Security Council officially imposed an embargo on armaments against Yugoslavia.</p>
                         <p id="RS.IS.77">In September 1998 the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1199, which demanded the immediate cessation of hostilities in Kosovo, the withdrawal of Serbian forces from the province, unrestricted access for humanitarian aid organizations, and the continuation of negotiations to determine the status of Kosovo. Following continued fighting south of Prishtina (Prishtinë/Priština—the administrative capital of Kosovo), NATO issued an ultimatum to President Milošević that air attacks against Yugoslavia would ensue unless he complied with UN demands. Milošević agreed to the presence in Kosovo of a 2,000-member OSCE `verification force’ to monitor the implementation of the Security Council’s demands. It was subsequently reported that the majority of federal army units had been withdrawn from Kosovo, but that some 11,600 members of the special Serbian security forces remained in the province.</p>
                         <p id="RS.IS.79">In November 1998 the deployment of OSCE observers in Kosovo commenced. However, following the outbreak of heavy fighting between the UÇK and Serbian forces in northern Kosovo in December, it became evident that the OSCE monitoring force was inadequate for peacekeeping operations. In January 1999 the discovery that some 45 ethnic Albanian civilians had been killed at the village of Reçak (Račak) prompted international condemnation of the Serbian authorities. A peace conference was convened by the Contact Group in Rambouillet, France, beginning on 6 February. On 18 March the ethnic Albanian representatives signed a peace agreement, which had been drafted by the Contact Group, in Rambouillet; however, the Serbian delegation continued to present objections (largely to the proposed deployment of NATO troops in Kosovo). Amid continued military action by Serbian forces in Kosovo, the NATO Secretary-General ordered the commencement of air attacks against Yugoslavia.</p>
                         <p id="RS.IS.81">On 24 March 1999 NATO commenced an aerial bombardment of air defences and military installations across Yugoslavia, demanding the full withdrawal of Serbian forces from Kosovo as a precondition to suspension of the air attacks. The Yugoslav Government declared a state of war, and suspended diplomatic relations with the USA, France, Germany and the UK (the countries directly involved in the attacks). The People’s Republic of China and Russia immediately condemned the air offensive. In early May the Group of Eight (G8—comprising seven Western industrialized nations and Russia) agreed on general principles for a political solution to the conflict.</p>
                         <p id="RS.IS.84">On 3 June 1999 the National Assembly formally approved a peace plan presented to the federal Government by EU and Russian envoys (based on the G8 principles). The peace agreement provided for the withdrawal of Serbian forces from Kosovo, and the deployment of a joint NATO-Russian peacekeeping force. Ethnic Albanian refugees were to be allowed to return to Kosovo, and the province was to be granted some autonomy under an interim administration. On 10 June the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1244 approving the peace plan for Kosovo, and NATO announced the suspension of the air offensive, after it had been verified that the withdrawal of Serbian forces had commenced. NATO formally approved the establishment of a Kosovo Force (KFOR).</p>
                         <p>
            Under the terms of the UN Resolution, the 
            <xr pageref="Y" ref="IO-UN.PKO.1">UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK)</xr>
             was established as the supreme legal and executive authority in Kosovo, with responsibility for civil administration, and for facilitating the reconstruction of the province as an autonomous region. On 20 June 1999 NATO announced that the air campaign had officially ended, following the withdrawal of Serbian forces. On 24 June the National Assembly formally ended the state of war in Serbia. Meanwhile, following the deployment of KFOR troops, nearly one-half of the ethnic Albanian refugees in neighbouring countries had returned to Kosovo by the end of the month, while an estimated 70,000 Serbs had fled from the province after reprisal attacks. Under a programme to establish partial provisional self-government in the province, elections to a Kosovo Assembly (Kuvendi i Kosovës/Skupština Kosova) were conducted in 2001.
          </p>
                         <p>In October 2005 the UN Security Council endorsed the initiation of final status negotiations on Kosovo; in November former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari was appointed by UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan as the Special Envoy for the Kosovo status process. The final status negotiations began in February 2006 in Vienna, Austria, and the first direct discussions involving the Presidents and Prime Ministers of Serbia and Kosovo were conducted in July. A new Serbian Constitution, which entered into effect in November, reaffirmed that Kosovo was part of the territory of Serbia, but was entitled to substantial autonomy. After the discussions ended without progress, on 26 March 2007 Ahtisaari submitted to the UN Security Council the finalized Comprehensive Proposal for the Kosovo Status Settlement, which recommended independence, to be supervised and supported for an initial period by an international military and civilian presence. Ahtisaari's plan was approved by the Kosovo Assembly on 5 April, but was rejected by the Serbian Government. In August a further series of negotiations began between Serbian and Kosovo delegations, with mediation by the USA, the EU and Russia. However, on 7 December it was announced that these negotiations had also failed to result in an agreement.</p>
                         <p>In January 2008 Hashim Thaçi, the Prime Minister of Kosovo and former leader of the UÇK, announced his intention to achieve territorial independence. On 17 February the Kosovo Assembly adopted a declaration establishing the province as the Republic of Kosovo (Kosova), a sovereign state independent from Serbia. Serbia, with the support of Russia, immediately demanded that the declaration of independence be annulled. Several nations, including Albania, France, the USA and the UK, extended recognition to Kosovo on 18 February, followed by many others; Serbia temporarily withdrew its ambassadors from those states. On 21 February Serb protesters rioted in Belgrade, attacking several embassies, including those of the UK and the USA. </p>
                         <p>
            The deployment of an EU Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX), which was scheduled to begin in June 2008, failed to proceed, owing to opposition from Kosovo Serbs and the Serbian Government. On 8 October the UN General Assembly adopted a Serbian resolution requesting that the 
            <xr pageref="Y" ref="IO-UN.527">International Court of Justice (ICJ)</xr>
             in The Hague arbitrate on the validity under international law of Kosovo’s unilateral declaration of independence from Serbia. In November the UN Secretary-General presented an amended plan on the reconfiguration of the international presence in Kosovo, and deployment of EULEX throughout Kosovo began in early December.
          </p>
                         <p>On 22 July 2010 the ICJ issued a non-binding opinion that Kosovo’s declaration of independence had not breached international law, UN Security Council Resolution 1244 or the constitutional framework. However, Serbia reaffirmed that it would continue to withhold recognition of independence for Kosovo. In September the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution, supported by Serbia and the EU member states, urging a direct dialogue between Serbia and Kosovo. Accordingly, in March 2011 EU-mediated discussions between Kosovo and Serbian delegations began in Brussels.</p>
                         <p>
            In January 2013 the discussions in Brussels resulted in Kosovo’s appointment of a liaison officer to Serbia and the reciprocal appointment by Serbia of a senior negotiator as its representative in Kosovo. With an imminent decision on the opening of Serbia’s EU accession negotiations expected (see 
            <i>Domestic Political Affairs</i>
            ), on 19 April Dačić and Thaçi initialled an accord in Brussels, confirming that ethnic Serb-dominated areas of northern Kosovo were to be administered by the central Kosovo authorities, while retaining substantial autonomy, and which also allowed both Serbia and Kosovo to seek EU accession without obstruction. Serbian and Kosovo government leaders continued discussions in Brussels on implementation of the agreement. Despite some progress, in March 2014 the Serbian Government protested that plans by the Kosovo authorities to reconstitute the Kosovo Security Force as a national army were in contravention of the April agreement. The EU-mediated dialogue in Brussels was subsequently suspended, finally resuming in February 2015. On 25 August the Kosovo and Serbian authorities signed a further agreement towards the normalization of relations, providing for the creation of an `Association of Serb Municipalities’ to represent minority Serb interests in northern Kosovo, which would be granted the status of a legal entity.
          </p>
                         <p>The normalization process was effectively halted in January 2017, following the arrest in France, under an international warrant issued by Serbia in 2004, of former Kosovo premier Ramush Haradinaj, a former senior UÇK leader who had twice been acquitted of war crimes by the ICTY. The attempted reopening of a railway line linking Belgrade to the Serb-controlled part of Kosovo intensified tensions in mid-January. Kosovo special police were deployed to halt the first train on the line, which bore the Serbian popular slogan `Kosovo is Serbian’ in some 20 languages. President Nikolić recalled the train, and threatened to dispatch troops, accusing Kosovo of provoking hostilities. An EU-mediated meeting between Kosovo and Serbian delegations, led by their respective premiers and Presidents, was convened on 24 January in Brussels, but failed to yield progress. On 27 April a French court ruled against the extradition of Haradinaj to Serbia, owing to concerns that he would not receive a fair trial; Serbia temporarily recalled its ambassador to France in protest against the decision.</p>
                         <p>On 21 November 2018 the Kosovo authorities announced that a newly introduced tariff on goods imported from Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina was to be increased to 100%, in response to `acts of aggression’ from Serbia. The Serbian Government in response suspended participation in the normalization dialogue. In addition, on 14 December the Kosovo Assembly approved legislation providing for the reconstitution of the Kosovo Security Force as a national army, despite continued strenuous opposition from Serbia. </p>
                         <p>Following mediation by the newly appointed US special envoy to the suspended Kosovo-Serbia dialogue, Richard Grenell, on 20 January 2020 a letter of intent was signed in Berlin, Germany, providing for the restoration of commercial flights between Prishtina and Belgrade for the first time since 1998. A further accord on the restoration of rail links between Kosovo and Serbia was signed on 14 February. Following increased pressure from the EU and the US Administration, at the end of March the Kosovo Government announced the removal of the 100% customs tariff on imports from Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, although new barriers under a principle of `reciprocity’ were imposed. In early June the Kosovo Government revoked the reciprocity measures on Serbian imports, allowing the resumption of the EU-mediated dialogue with Serbia. However, a summit meeting between Thaçi and Vučić in Washington, DC, scheduled for 27 June, was cancelled, after Thaçi, and other prominent Kosovo officials were indicted for war crimes committed in 1998-99. </p>
                         <p>With mediation by Grenell, the delayed summit meeting took place between Kosovo Prime Minister Avdullah Hoti and Vučić in Washington, DC, on 3-4 September 2020. Separate agreements providing for 16 `economic normalization’ measures were signed by the two leaders, in the presence of US President Donald Trump, on 4 September. These included an undertaking by Serbia to suspend its campaign against international recognition of Kosovo for a period of one year, during which Kosovo would not apply for membership of international organizations. </p>
                         <p>In September 2021 the Kosovo authorities introduced new regulations obliging Serbian-registered vehicles to use temporary Kosovo licence plates while in Kosovo, under the `reciprocity’ measures. Special police forces were deployed by the Kosovo authorities, after Kosovo Serbs protesters blockaded two main crossing points at the northern border. President Vučić dispatched troops to the border and indicated that Serbia would intervene militarily to protect Kosovo Serbs. Miroslav Lajčák, the EU Special Representative for the mediated dialogue, announced at the end of September that an interim agreement had been reached to end the blockade and the deployment of special police units. However, after failure to negotiate a permanent resolution to the licence place dispute, the Kosovo authorities sought to implement a regulation that would oblige Serbs to replace car licence plates issued by Serbia with Kosovan ones; enforcement of the measure was postponed at the end of July 2022, following violent protests in northern Kosovo. A meeting between President Vučić and Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti in Brussels on 18 August ended without progress. The Kosovo authorities accordingly began implementation of a licence plate conversion plan on 1 November, prompting the mass resignation of Serbs from government and official posts. Following urgent EU-mediated negotiations in Brussels, on 23 November an agreement was reached to avert escalation of the dispute, under which the Kosovo Government was to suspend action related to the re-registration of vehicles, while Serbia would no longer issue licence plates with Serbian acronyms for Kosovo’s cities.</p>
                         <p>The arrest of a former Serb police officer in Kosovo on 10 December 2022 precipitated a further confrontation; Serb protesters erected barricades in northern Kosovo, blocking two main border crossings with Serbia, and subsequently exchanged fire with police. On 26 December the Serbian Government placed security forces deployed on the border with Kosovo on `full combat readiness’. However, following increased pressure from the EU and the USA amid continued mediated discussions (and the release of the police officer to house arrest), Vučić announced that the protesters had agreed to remove the barricades.</p>
                         <p>
            Following a meeting with EU and US representatives on 20 January 2023, Vučić reported that he had been pressurized to accept a new EU proposal for the normalization of relations with Kosovo. Vučić and Kurti met for EU-mediated discussions in Brussels on 27 February, when provisional agreement was reached on an 11-point plan, under which Kosovo and Serbia would, 
            <i>inter alia</i>
            , mutually recognize their respective documents and national symbols, respect each other’s independence and territorial integrity, exchange permanent missions and continue to implement previous agreements; Serbia also committed not to oppose Kosovo’s membership of international organizations. The accord was criticized by right-wing parties in Serbia, on the grounds that it implied acceptance of Kosovo’s independence. A further meeting between Kurti and Vučić in Ohrid, North Macedonia, on 18 March resulted in a `verbal’ agreement to implement the plan. However, Vučić refused to sign the accord and emphasized shortly afterwards that he remained opposed to official recognition of Kosovo. Particular contention surrounded the model for the previously agreed Association of Serb Municipalities, which Kosovo committed to establish. In the first indication of progress, on 19 April a Joint Monitoring Committee was established to oversee the implementation of the agreement. However, on 24 April Serbia voted against an application by Kosovo to join the Council of Europe (which was provisionally approved). Meeting in Brussels on 2 May, Vučić and Kurti agreed to endorse a declaration on missing persons, which was intended to expedite efforts to locate some 1,600 people who had disappeared during 1998-99. (The declaration was reported to remain unimplemented by April 2024.)
          </p>
                         <p>The Kosovo Government accused Vučić of supporting an attack by a group of Serb militants in northern Kosovo on 24 September 2023, in which a Kosovo police officer was shot dead. A national day of mourning was declared in Serbia for the deaths of three Serb militants. The deputy leader of the local Srpska Lista (Serb List) party, Milan Radoičić, fled to Belgrade and admitted involvement in the operation. In early October Radoičić was arrested and questioned by the Serbian authorities on charges of procuring weapons, but he was subsequently released. The European Parliament later that month adopted a resolution to introduce sanctions against Serbia if its involvement in the attack were proved.</p>
                         <p>French President Emmanuel Macron, German Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni mediated a further meeting between Kurti and Vučić in Brussels on 26 October 2023, after which the three leaders issued a statement urging commitment to implementing the Ohrid agreement. In late December the Serbian Government announced that the use of Kosovo official licence plates would be permitted in Serbian territory from 1 January 2024 and the Kosovo authorities issued a reciprocal decision shortly afterwards. However, at the beginning of February a Kosovo central bank regulation on the sole use of the euro for commercial transactions, effectively prohibiting the use of the Serbian dinar in Serb-majority regions, officially entered into force. Serbian-funded `parallel’ facilities in three municipalities were subsequently closed by the police. The ban prompted further protests by Serbs in northern Kosovo and was denounced by Vučić, who announced Serbia would continued to provide public-sector salaries and social assistance to Kosovo Serbs in dinars. In April, shortly after the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe voted in favour of Kosovo’s accession to the body, the Serbian authorities began to stop Kosovo citizens at the border and temporarily placed the Kosovo Deputy Director of police in custody.</p>

                         <p>On 27 February 2006 a case submitted to the ICJ in 1993 by Bosnia and Herzegovina against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (represented by Serbia, as its successor state), claiming reparations for acts of genocide perpetrated against the Bosniak population in 1992-95, commenced. On 26 February 2007 the ICJ ruled that the Serbian state was not directly responsible for genocide or complicity in genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1992-95. However, the Court declared that Serbia was in violation of its obligation under international law by having failed to prevent the 1995 massacre in Srebrenica and to co-operate fully with the ICTY. Meanwhile, a `special relations’ agreement was signed by the ethnic Serb-dominated entity in the north and east of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republika Srpska, and Serbia in September 2006.</p>
                         <p>Serbian Prime Minister Vučić visited Bosnia and Herzegovina to attend a 20th anniversary commemoration of the Srebrenica massacre on 11 July 2015; however, he was obliged to flee from violent protesters at the ceremony, causing the Serbian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to issue a formal complaint. The members of the Bosnian Presidency met Vučić in Serbia later in July, after which both sides pledged co-operation. The members of the Bosnian Presidency again met Vučić (following his election as President) and other Serbian government leaders during a visit to Belgrade in December 2017.</p>
                         <p>During a visit to Zagreb, Croatia, in June 2007, President Tadić issued an unprecedented apology to the Croatian people for atrocities committed by Serbs during the war. However, Croatia’s relations with Serbia became strained after the Croatian Government recognized Kosovo’s independence in March 2008. In November the ICJ ruled that it had jurisdiction to hear charges of genocide presented by Croatia against Serbia in 1999, pertaining to crimes allegedly committed by Yugoslav forces in Croatia in 1991-95. In January 2010 Serbia submitted a genocide counter-case against Croatia for alleged war crimes committed during Operation Storm, during which Croatia regained control of formerly Serb-controlled regions of north-east Croatia in 1995. On 3 February 2015 the ICJ issued a ruling rejecting Croatia’s genocide case against Serbia, on the grounds that Croatia had failed to substantiate its allegations; Serbia’s counter-claim was also rejected, based on the conclusion that Operation Storm had been intended to cause the mass deportation of ethnic Serbs from Croatia rather than genocide.</p>
                         <p>
            In early 2016 Serbian government officials expressed concerns at an armaments procurement programme launched by Croatia in co-operation with the USA (while Serbia also undertook the modernization of its armed forces—see 
            <i>Other External Relations</i>
            ). Following further bilateral tensions, Croatia initially blocked the opening of two chapters (on the judiciary and human rights) in Serbia’s EU accession negotiations; the chapters were opened in July, following a compromise agreement under which Croatian concerns, principally over jurisdiction to prosecute war crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia during the 1990s, would be addressed by the EU. At the invitation of Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović, President Vučić made his first official visit to Zagreb in February 2018; the two leaders pledged to improve relations, agreeing to establish bilateral commissions to resolve a dispute over the shared border along the River Danube. However, in August a statement made by Vučić at a commemoration ceremony for Serb victims of Operation Storm, comparing Croatia’s treatment of ethnic Serbs to the acts of Second World War Nazi Germany, prompted the cancellation of a planned visit by Grabar-Kitarović to Serbia. A visit by Prime Minister Brnabić to Zagreb on 30 April 2023, when she met her Croatian counterpart, Andrej Plenković, following an exchange of ministerial visits earlier that year, marked some improvement in bilateral relations.

                         <p>In October 2014 a football match in Belgrade between the national teams of Serbia and Albania degenerated into violence, precipitated by a drone carrying a `Greater Albania’ banner flying over the stadium. A planned visit by Prime Minister Edi Rama to Serbia, the first by an Albanian premier in around 68 years, was postponed, but finally took place in November. The Serbian Government formally protested to Albania in January 2015, after a `Greater Albania’ flag was displayed at Rama’s residence, and again in April, following a statement by Rama warning that Albania and Kosovo would unite unless Kosovo’s EU integration process was advanced. However, Vučić made an official visit to the Albanian capital, Tirana, the first by a Serbian premier, on 27 May.</p>
                         <p>Tensions developed between Serbia and the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia (FYRM—now North Macedonia), following the installation in that country of the new, pro-Western Government of Zoran Zaev at the end of May 2017. In August Serbia recalled its diplomatic staff from the FYRM, a decision that many observers associated with Macedonian support for Kosovo’s prospective membership of UNESCO. However, Zaev and Vučić agreed to resolve bilateral disagreements through dialogue, and met in Belgrade in November. On 10 October 2019 Vučić, Zaev and Albanian premier Rama, meeting in Novi Sad, signed a declaration of intent to establish a free movement zone between their respective states. Agreements on wide-ranging economic co-operation were signed between Serbia, North Macedonia and Albania at subsequent summits under the `Open Balkan’ initiative, including in Tirana in December 2021, in Ohrid in June 2022 and in Belgrade in September. In July 2023 Rama reportedly announced that the initiative had fulfilled its objectives (indicating an intention to focus on Albania’s EU membership application). Nevertheless, on 22 January 2024 representatives of North Macedonia, Serbia and Albania signed two protocols for the establishment of a free labour market between the three countries under the Open Balkan initiative, with effect from 1 March.</p>
                         <p>
            A diplomatic dispute erupted in November 2020 after the Montenegrin Government declared the Serbian ambassador 
            <i>persona non grata</i>
            , in response to public statements he had made referring to Montenegro’s 1918 unification with Serbia as an act of `liberation’. A new pro-Serbian Government in Montenegro that took office in December 2020 declared its intention to restore good bilateral relations, but failed to reverse the decision on the expulsion. At the end of September 2022 the expelled former Serbian ambassador was among 28 foreign nationals subject to an entry ban imposed by the Montenegrin Government for `malign’ activity. The newly elected Montenegrin President, Jakov Milatović, made an official visit to Serbia in July 2023, when he and Vučić pledged to repair strained relations between the two countries.

            Relations between Russia and Serbia were consolidated in early 2008, with the signature of an agreement whereby Serbia was to join Russia's `South Stream' natural gas pipeline project and Russian state-controlled energy producer Gazprom acquired a 51% share in the Serbian state-owned petroleum enterprise, Naftna Industrija Srbije. In October 2009 Russian President Dmitrii Medvedev made an official visit to Serbia (the first by a Russian head of state). A 10-year agreement, signed in March 2013, provided for increased exports of Russian natural gas to Serbia. In May President Nikolić met President Vladimir Putin in Sochi, Russia, where they signed a declaration of strategic partnership, and in November the Serbian and Russian Ministers of Defence signed a 15-year military co-operation agreement in Belgrade. The Serbian Government failed to participate in EU sanctions imposed against Russia in March 2014, following Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula and subsequent conflict in eastern Ukraine (see Ukraine). In December Putin announced the unexpected cancellation of the South Stream gas pipeline project, citing opposition from the EU. Prime Minister Vučić made an official visit to the Russian capital, Moscow, in October 2015, when memorandums of understanding providing for increased economic co-operation, investment and the development of joint projects were signed. Vučić again met Putin in Moscow in March 2017; the two leaders discussed the strengthening of bilateral economic relations and defence co-operation. Under a military-technical assistance agreement signed the previous December, in October Serbia received a donation of six fighter aircraft from Russia. Putin made an official visit to Belgrade on 17 January 2019, receiving a large public welcome; more than 20 co-operative agreements were signed, including on a joint venture between Gazprom and Serbia’s state gas company Srbijagas, which would construct an extension to Russia’s TurkStream gas pipeline (the successor project to South Stream). 
            <!--https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/natural-gas/030220-serbias-onshore-extension-of-turkstream-gas-link-laid-minister-->
            Construction on Serbia’s 403-km section of the TurkStream gas pipeline, which was to connect Bulgaria and Hungary, was completed in early 2020. Meanwhile, on 25 October 2019 Prime Minister Brnabić signed a free trade agreement with the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union. On 4 December, shortly after the delivery of four military helicopters to Serbia, Vučić met Putin in Sochi. In February 2020, following a visit by Russian Minister of Defence Sergei Shoigu to Belgrade, Serbia received two of six anti-aircraft systems purchased from Russia. The Russian Government in October authorized its Ministry of Defence to open a liaison office in Serbia. 
          </p>
                         <p>Serbia voted in favour of a resolution adopted by the UN General Assembly on 2 March 2022 that condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February, and of a further resolution suspending Russia from the UN Human Rights Council on 7 April. Nevertheless, Serbia remained the only European state to refuse to join wide-ranging EU sanctions imposed against Russia and its ally, Belarus. Meanwhile, rallies in support of Russia were organized by far-right movements in Belgrade. On 29 May Vučić announced that he had secured a new three-year natural gas supply agreement with Gazprom, at a favourable price, in contravention of Western policy. However, in mid-2023 Vučić indicated that he was not opposed to the delivery of Serbian-manufactured ammunition to Ukraine by third countries, and in April 2024, during a visit to Paris, France, he announced that an agreement had been reached on a major purchase of French fighter jets. Meanwhile, Vučić attended the first Ukraine-South East Europe summit, held in Tirana, on 28 February, meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.</p>
                         <p>President Tadić made an official seven-day visit to China in August 2009, when a bilateral strategic partnership agreement was signed. Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Serbia in June 2016 to discuss co-operation under China’s Belt and Road Initiative; a total of 22 agreements in the areas of finance and infrastructure were signed. A Serbian government delegation led by President Vučić, visiting the Chinese capital, Beijing, for an international forum in April 2019, signed several major agreements on construction projects with Chinese corporations. Under a contract signed in 2020, Serbia received delivery of a Chinese anti-aircraft missile system in April 2022. The Chinese enterprise Zijin Mining in September 2023 announced plans to expand its copper mining operations near the eastern town of Bor, despite longstanding environmental concerns; in February 2024 protests by local residents forced the temporary suspension of production. President Xi made a state visit to Serbia on 8 May, when 29 co-operative agreements were signed; a free trade agreement previously signed between Serbia and China was to enter into effect on 1 July.</p>
                         <p>On 15 January 2015 NATO approved a two-year Individual Partnership Action Plan for Serbia (the highest level of co-operation between the Alliance and a non-member state). Newly elected President Vučić met US Vice-President Mike Pence during a visit to Washington, DC, in July 2017, when he emphasized continued co-operation between the Serbian army and the US National Guard.</p>
                         <p>
            Meanwhile, EU membership negotiations formally began in January 2014 (see 
            <i>Nikolić Elected President</i>
            ). A sharp escalation in the numbers of migrants traversing the Balkans to Western Europe precipitated a regional crisis and exacerbated strains between neighbouring states during the second half of 2015. An agreement reached between the EU and Turkey in March 2016 on ending irregular migration from Turkey effectively closed the `Balkan route’ of transit. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen visited Serbia on 28 October 2022, when she urged alignment with the EU sanctions regime applied against Russia. At early 2024 Serbia had opened 22 of a total 35 chapters in its EU accession negotiations and provisionally closed only two.

In April 2016 Serbia’s only steel mill, the Železara Smederevo plant, was acquired by a Chinese steel producer. As Serbia’s economic co-operation with China deepened, in June a number of agreements in the areas of finance and infrastructure were signed. The Government in March 2020 announced economic support measures to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic for households and companies. Serbia’s GDP contracted by 0.9% in 2020, one of the lowest declines in Europe, and then expanded by 7.5% in 2021, following a strong recovery in private consumption and investment. Following the Russian Federations’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 Serbia’s oil corporation Naftna Industrija Srbije, part-owned by Gazprom Neft, became subject to EU energy sanctions against Russia (but was later provisionally exempted). The global impact of war in Ukraine resulted in sharply elevated food and energy prices, compounding shortfalls in domestic electricity production. The IMF in December approved a new, two-year SBA of €2,400m. (which was regarded by the Serbian authorities as precautionary), and emphasized the need for comprehensive energy sector reforms, including the restructuring of state-owned power utility Elektroprivreda Srbije. Amid depressed trade and a sharp rise in inflation, growth in real GDP declined to 2.3% in 2022. In April 2023 the Government converted Elektroprivreda Srbije into a joint-stock company and it recorded a profit in that year. An EU-funded Bulgaria-Serbia Interconnector Gas Pipeline, intended to provide Serbia with access to Azerbaijani natural gas exports and reduce its dependence on Russian supplies, was inaugurated in December. The IMF reported recovery from the energy sector crisis, supported by programme reforms and lower regional energy prices, and in March 2024 reached an agreement with Serbia on the conclusion of the third review under the SBA. The Government subsequently announced that the arrangement would be extended for a further two years. Estimated GDP growth of 2.5% in 2023 was projected by the IMF to strengthen to 3.5% in 2024, as the annual inflation rate fell (to around 5% by March) and domestic demand revived.
