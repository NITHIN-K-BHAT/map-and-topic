      The northern territory of Vojvodina, an Autonomous Province, which has a significant ethnic Hungarian population, forms a distinct part of the Republic of Serbia, with its own executive and assembly. Serbia also claims sovereignty over the southern, predominantly ethnic Albanian, territory of Kosovo. This latter territory declared independence, as the

          <p>The Autonomous Province of Vojvodina comprises around one-quarter of the territory of Serbia (excluding Kosovo). The principal city is Novi Sad. Vojvodina had been a Hungarian margraviate or banat (frontier province), in which the Habsburgs had settled other ethnic groups to defend Christendom against the Ottomans. A large Serb population first settled there in 1690. In the 19th century the Habsburgs created a province of Serbian Vojvodina, hoping to satisfy the aspirations of the Serb nationalists. At the end of the Second World War more Serbs settled there, becoming the dominant ethnic group, by 2002 constituting around 65% of the population. The Statute of Vojvodina, the constitutive act of the province, permits, in addition to the Serbian language, the official use of the languages of the largest national minorities: Hungarian, Slovak, Romanian, Croatian and Pannonian Rusyn (Ruthenian).</p>
          <p>Vojvodina received the status of Autonomous Province in 1945. In October 1988 demonstrations organized by supporters of the leader of the Savez komunista Srbije (League of Communists of Serbia), Slobodan Milošević, secured a provincial leadership sympathetic to Serb nationalist interests. The Hungarian Government expressed concern for the rights of the ethnic Hungarian minority during 1990-91, particularly following the effective removal of Vojvodina’s autonomous status by the 1990 Serbian Constitution. This change in the balance of powers was confirmed by the April 1992 Yugoslav Constitution. However, Vojvodina retained a provincial Assembly, and the minority ethnic groups of Vojvodina had representative political or social organizations.</p>
          <p>In the mid-&#160;and late 1990s there were signs that opposition was increasing among the inhabitants of Vojvodina to the province’s domination by the Serbian authorities. In May 1996 some 17 political parties, associations and organizations signed a manifesto demanding the restoration of autonomy to Vojvodina. This move was the beginning of a campaign to amend the 1990 Serbian Constitution and the 1992 Yugoslav Constitution to restore the province’s autonomous status, with full legislative, judicial and executive powers. Potential conflict emerged in May 2000, following the assassination of the President of the Executive Council (administration) of Vojvodina, Boško Perošević, for which opposition parties were blamed. In early June opposition parties established a united Vojvodina Democratic Opposition. The governing coalition in Vojvodina opposed the various constitutional changes to the Yugoslav Constitution instigated by Milošević, by then the Yugoslav President, which provided for a further centralization of power. In July Vojvodina threatened to declare independence in protest. Elections to the Vojvodina Assembly took place in two rounds on 24 September and 8 October. Parties of the opposition alliance, the Demokratska Opozicija Srbije (the Democratic Opposition of Serbia) secured 71.7% of votes cast, and 86 of the 120 elective seats. Pressures towards the centralization of power in Serbia and Yugoslavia abated somewhat following the removal of Milošević from office in October.</p>
          <p>Following the failure of the Koalicija Vojvodina (Coalition Vojvodina) to secure representation in the Serbian legislature in legislative elections in December 2003, its main constituent party, the Vajdasági Magyar Szövetség (VMSz—Alliance of Vojvodina Hungarians), announced its withdrawal from the coalition, urging its supporters to campaign for provincial autonomy. Nationalist violence in Vojvodina, with frequent attacks against members of the Croat and Hungarian communities, subsequently increased. The VMSz welcomed the victory of a reformist, Boris Tadić of the Demokratska Stranka (DS—Democratic Party), in Serbia’s June 2004 presidential election.</p>
          <p>Elections to the 120-member Vojvodina Assembly took place, concurrently with local elections across Serbia, on 19 September and 3 October 2004. The Serb nationalist Srpska Radikalna Stranka (SRS—Serbian Radical Party) secured 36 seats, the DS 34 seats and the VMSz 11 seats. The latter two parties formed a coalition administration with several smaller groups, and Bojan Pajtić of the DS became President of the Executive Council. An SRS candidate, Maja Gojković, was elected Mayor of Novi Sad, narrowly defeating the DS candidate. In March 2005 the Executive Council adopted proposals (which were subsequently presented to the Serbian Government) on the province's future constitutional status, providing for full autonomy.</p>
          <p>Following Serbia's declaration of independence from the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro on 5 June 2006, a new Serbian Constitution, which was endorsed by national referendum on 28-29 October, granted Vojvodina powers of financial autonomy. Provisions were included for elections both to the Vojvodina Assembly and for deputies to the local self-government assemblies by the end of 2007. Pajtić welcomed the adoption of the new Constitution, which he regarded as facilitating the decentralization of power and regional development.</p>
          <p>On 11 May 2008 elections to the Vojvodina Assembly took place concurrently with legislative and local government elections throughout Serbia; a further round of voting followed on 25 May. A pro-European DS-led alliance secured 64 of 120 seats in the Assembly. Support for the SRS was dramatically reduced, from 36 to 24 seats, while a coalition led by the VMSz representing Hungarian interests won nine seats. In July Sándor Egeresi of the VMSz was elected President of the Vojvodina Assembly, while Pajtić was re-elected President of the Executive Council with the support of 86 deputies in the Assembly, with the ruling coalition that had formed the outgoing administration effectively remaining in office.</p>
          <p>In September 2008 it was announced that the governing coalition had agreed on the text of a new Statute of Vojvodina. On 15 October the Vojvodina Assembly adopted the draft Statute by 89 votes, and submitted it for the consent of the national legislature in Belgrade. Vojvodina Assembly deputies belonging to the SRS, the Demokratska Stranka Srbije (DSS—Democratic Party of Serbia) and Nova Srbije (NS—New Serbia) strenuously opposed the draft, particularly objecting to proposals that the Executive Council be renamed the Provincial Government and that the Assembly be granted the authority to adopt `provincial legal acts’. Following the ratification of the Statute by the Serbian legislature, it was to be returned to the Vojvodina Assembly for proclamation, whereupon it would officially take effect. A law on the transfer of certain powers from Serbia to Vojvodina was also to be adopted by the Serbian legislature, although this process was delayed by opposition parties that objected to what they termed the `creation of a state within a state’. In June 2009 the DSS adopted a declaration on Vojvodina, stating that, as an integral part of Serbia, its position should remain unchanged under the terms of the Serbian Constitution. In December the Serbian legislature finally adopted the Statute of Vojvodina, which duly entered into force on 1 January 2010.</p>
          <p>Elections to the Vojvodina Assembly took place on 6 and 20 May 2012, concurrently with presidential and legislative elections throughout Serbia. A DS-led alliance obtained 57 of the 120 seats in the Assembly, narrowly failing to retain an absolute majority of seats. A coalition led by the Serb nationalist Srpska Napredna Stranka (Serbian Progressive Party),, won 22 seats, while a coalition comprising the Socijalistička Partija Srbije (Socialist Party of Serbia), the Partija Ujedinjenih Penzionera Srbije (Party of United Pensioners of Serbia), Jedinstvena Srbija (United Serbia) and the Socijaldemokratska Partija Srbije (Social Democratic Party of Serbia) won 13 seats. A coalition Executive Council led by Bojan Pajtić of the DS was subsequently formed, including members of the DS, the Liga Socijaldemokrata Vojvodine (LSV—League of Social Democrats of Vojvodina) and the VMSz. Istvan Pásztor, the leader of the VMSz, was elected President of the Vojvodina Assembly.</p>
          <p>In July 2012 the Constitutional Court ruled some 20 provisions of the self-proclaimed Statute on Vojvodina to be unconstitutional, including that naming Novi Sad as the capital of the province, and that permitting Vojvodina to open a representative office in Brussels, Belgium. Tensions between the provincial and national authorities subsequently intensified, in part reflecting the differing political complexions of the Governments in Serbia and Vojvodina.</p>
          <p>The publication, in April 2013, by Pajtić of a Draft Declaration on the Protection of Constitutional and Legal Rights of Vojvodina, which was intended (following debate in the provincial Assembly) to protect the autonomous status of the province, was a particular focus of discontent for Serb nationalists. Later in the month around 30,000 protesters from across Serbia attended a rally outside the offices of the Vojvodina Government in Novi Sad to protest against what they claimed was support for separatism in the document and to demand the resignation of the provincial au­thor­ities; Pajtić alleged that the protests had been organized with the support of the Serbian Government. None the less, the Vojvodina Assembly approved the Declaration in May. In September seven officials were arrested in Novi Sad in connection with the reported embezzlement of some €1.3m. in state funds; they included Borislav Novaković, the leader of the DS faction in the Vojvodina Assembly, and a former President of the municipal Assembly of Novi Sad. In December the Constitutional Court of Serbia concluded that 40 provisions of the Statute violated the Constitution, and demanded that amendments be made by 6 June 2014. In early April a new draft Statute on Vojvodina was presented to the Assembly by a working group, which envisaged the removal of autonomous designations such as `government’ and `capital’ of the province. (Novi Sad was instead designated as the administrative centre of the Autonomous Province, although references to the Provincial Government—previously known as the Executive Council—remained in the final document.) The Assembly adopted the Statute, which included extensive provisions for the protection of the rights of minority ethnic and linguistic groups in mid-May. In late September the Vojvodina Assembly adopted a declaration, presented by the LSV, stating the requirement for a new Serbian Constitution that would better protect and define Vojvodina’s autonomous status. On 4 November Pajtić reorganized the Provincial Government.</p>
          <p>Elections to the Vojvodina Assembly were scheduled for 24 April 2016, concurrently with pre-term national elections. The elections, in which the rate of participation by the electorate was recorded at 55.7%, resulted in a loss of support for the erstwhile provincial authorities, and a strengthening of the parties in the national Government. As in the national elections, Vučić’s SP was the most successful party or alliance, winning a narrow majority of seats (63) in the Assembly, with 44.5% of the votes cast. An alliance of the SPS and JS was second-placed, with 8.9% and 12 seats, ahead of the SRS, with 7.7% and 10 seats. A four-party coalition led by Pajtić, Za Vojvodinu Rada i Znanja (Work and Knowledge for Vojvodina), including the DS and NS, obtained 7.2% and 10 seats, and the LSV obtained 6.4% and nine seats. DjB obtained 5.5% and seven seats; the VMSz obtained 4.9% and six seats. On 20 June Igor Mirović, of the SNS, was confirmed as Chairman of the Provincial Government; the new coalition Provincial Government principally comprised members of the SNS, the SPS and the VMSz.</p>
          <p>The protest rallies that began in Belgrade in December 2018 were subsequently also organized across Vojvodina; in March 2019 it was reported that Radiotelevizija Vojvodina (Radio-Television of Vojvodina) had rejected a number of demands by protesters complaining of biased media coverage.</p>
          <p>
      Elections to the Vojvodina Assembly took place on 21 June 2020, at the same time as the national elections, having been postponed from 26 April owing to the state of emergency imposed in response to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis. As was the case with the national elections, opposition parties boycotted the elections, and overall turnout was recorded at 50.3%. The results reflected the national situation, and resulted in increased support for the SNS-led coalition, Aleksandar Vučić—Za Našu Decu (Aleksandar Vučić—For Our Children), which secured 61.6% of the votes and 76 seats in the Assembly. The SPS-JS alliance retained second place, with 11.2% of the votes and 13 seats; the VMSz obtained 9.3% and 11 seats. A coalition led by the LSV secured 5.1% of the votes and six seats, while a DSS-led coalition won 4.4% of the votes and five seats. 
      
      The Pokret obnove Kraljevine Srbije (Movement for the Restoration of the Kingdom of Serbia) also won five seats, with 4.2% of the votes, and the SRS won 3.3% of the votes and four seats.
