          <heading>Introduction</heading>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P1">Slovakia’s independence was prompted by sharp economic disparities between the Czech and Slovak Republics after the abandonment of communism and the centrally planned economy. Since independence the Slovakian economy has consistently exceeded expectations. By the beginning of 2019 gross domestic product (GDP) had reached 208% of its 1989 level, one of the highest rates of recovery among Eastern European countries in the European Union (EU). Between 1997 and 2019 Slovakia’s income per head rose from 51.3% of the EU average to 74.0%, surpassing that of Portugal and Greece.</p>

          <heading>Agriculture</heading>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P2">The country’s farming regions can be divided into four zones, which follow the relief from south to north. These are the warm southern plains, suitable for the cultivation of maize and vines; a cooler zone, extending across the entire country, in which wheat, barley and sugar beet are grown; a slightly larger belt, suitable for growing rye, oats and potatoes; and a mountain region used mainly for grazing, which covers about one-quarter of the total area. The Nitra region, east of the capital, Bratislava, is the most productive agricultural area in the country. In total, 39% of the country’s area is used for arable farming and grazing, and just over 40% of the territory is covered by forests. However, during 2002-18 the area of farmland cultivated declined by over 15%.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P3">In 2018 about 59% of agricultural land was used for farming, but the proportion reached 87% in the Nitra region and 89% in the central Banská Bystrica region. Before 1989 farms were almost entirely collectivized or organized in co-operatives. By 2020 fewer than 1% were co-operatives, and under 60 remained in public ownership. However, almost 50% of farms are little more than garden plots, less than one-half of a hectare in size; only 8.3% would be classified as farms in Western Europe. The sector has seen increased yields in grain and livestock, although production of some commodities has declined since the early 2000s, as have livestock numbers. After EU accession, farm subsidies increased, owing to payments from the Common Agricultural Policy and support from EU structural funds.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P4">After 1989 agriculture, including forestry and related activities, declined in importance, its share of GDP falling from 8.2% in 1990 to 2.5% in 2022. The number of people engaged in agriculture has fallen steadily, from 12.0% of the workforce in 1990 to 2.5% in 2022. Farm wages have also declined, and in 2018 were 76% of the national average. Two-thirds of the agricultural labour force on farms owned by individuals are aged 50 or over, and 40% are aged 60 or over. In 2010 women represented 16% of sole farm owners. Education levels in rural areas remain relatively low: less than one-half of the rural population has completed education beyond the primary level. Furthermore, the rate of rural unemployment is higher than the national average.</p>

          <heading>Industry, Construction, Investment and Trade</heading>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P5">Since 1989 industry in Slovakia has undergone substantial change, owing mainly to privatization and foreign direct investment (FDI). Communist-era Slovakia had a narrow industrial base, specializing in the production of armaments. Industrial capacity was concentrated in large state-owned enterprises with many thousands of employees. After 1989, a federal government decision to end weapons production severely affected the armaments industry, and industrial production declined sharply. By 1992 armaments production was just 7.2% of the 1988 level. Employment in all industries declined by over 28% between 1990 and 1995. From 1995 industrial output increased sharply. Labour productivity improved, and employment in industry rose continuously, amounting to 35.8% of the employed labour force in 2022. In that year the manufacturing sector alone engaged 23.7% of the employed labour force, and construction an additional 9.8%. Industry accounted for 32.1% of GDP in 2022.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P6">During 1993-98 the Government undertook a series of flawed privatizations. After taking office in October 1998, the Government of Mikuláš Dzurinda renationalized and restructured many large, formerly state-owned enterprises which were technically bankrupt, before again putting them up for sale. The most important reprivatization was that of the steel manufacturer Východoslovenskéželeziarne (Eastern Slovakian Metalworks), one of the most modern steel companies in the region and the country’s largest firm. In October 2000, following a substantial restructuring, it was sold to US Steel (of the USA), which invested US&#160;$236m. in the plant during 2000-10. In 2022 it had 8,000 employees. The Government also renationalized, restructured and reprivatized most of the banking sector. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development estimated that restructuring costs equalled 1.0%-1.5% of GDP in both 2002 and 2003. After restructuring, most of the country’s banks were foreign-owned, and over 90% of deposits were in foreign-owned banks. Revenues from the privatization process were used to reduce government debt and pay for the costs of transition. Tax and labour market reforms encouraged inward investment.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P7">Slovakia’s admission to the eurozone in January 2009 generated new deposits in the banking system, as people paid cash into banks before the currency conversion. After 2009 bank profits grew, and by 2011/12 non-performing loans accounted for just 5.5% of all loans—one of the lowest levels in Central and South-Eastern Europe. Bank assets consist mainly of domestic loans and government bonds, and liabilities are primarily from deposits. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Slovakian banking sector is well positioned to cope successfully with financial upheavals and remained on target to meet Basel III rules intended to guarantee banking soundness.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P8">Slovakia has become a major industrial force in Central and Western European markets. Car production has become a leading industry. Between 1991 and 2013 Volkswagen (of Germany) invested over €1,500m. in Slovakia. Volkswagen’s success attracted other car and components manufacturers. From January 2003 Peugeot Citroën (of France—now Stellantis) invested €700m. in building a plant at Trnava. Production began in 2006. The investment was supported by state aid amounting to more than €250m., including tax and other incentives and investment in infrastructure. In early 2004 Hyundai (of the Republic of Korea—South Korea) announced plans to construct a plant in Žilina for Kia cars, creating about 3,100 jobs. Production started in 2006, with an expansion target of annual output of 300,000 cars. The Kia plant in Žilina is closely linked to the Hyundai plant in Nošovice in the Czech Republic; the Kia plant supplies engines to Hyundai, which makes gearboxes for both factories. In 2010 Kia Motors announced plans to construct a new plant to produce car engines, and subsequently also planned to produce hybrid cars.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P9">In late 2015 Jaguar Land Rover (of the United Kingdom) announced plans to build a new factory in Nitra, which was to produce 150,000 vehicles annually, employing some 2,800 people. Construction commenced in September 2016. It was subsequently announced that the Land Rover Discovery model, hitherto manufactured in the UK, would be produced at the plant, which opened in October 2018. The plant is among the most modern in Europe and one of the most advanced in the world, containing a rapid automated assembly line. Annual output by all car manufacturers in Slovakia, which amounted to just 295,391 vehicles in 2006, surpassed 1m. vehicles in 2015-18, reaching 1.1m. vehicles in 2019. After the opening of the Jaguar Land Rover plant, car manufacturing was expected to expand further, to nearly 1.2m. units in 2020, but the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent fall in demand led to a drop of 11% in output in that year. In 2021 car production again exceeded 1m. units, and manufacturers announced initiatives to start manufacturing electric vehicles. By 2021 the car manufacturing sector employed 245,000 people, including 164,000 in the four car production companies and tier one suppliers. It accounted for 48% of industrial output, generated 12% of GDP, and accounted for almost half of industrial exports. As recently as 2020, Slovakia produced no electric vehicles. However, in 2021 it produced nine hybrid vehicles and two fully electric ones. Given Slovakia’s extensive car manufacturing base, as the production of electric cars increases the manufacturing base is likely to adapt to the new circumstances, leading to the retooling of assembly lines and the production of electric vehicles. In mid-2022 Volvo of Sweden and the Slovakian Government announced that from 2023 Volvo would construct a new electric car factory at the Valaliky Industrial Park near Košice, which would commence operations by 2026. The plant was to create 3,300 jobs, and manufacture 250,000 SUV cars annually. It was estimated that an additional 13,000-23,000 jobs would result from the investment.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P10">The modernization of Slovakia’s aluminium, iron and steel manufacturing facilities created a solid base in ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgy, encouraging the development of industries that rely on these products, including the automotive and white goods sectors. For over 10 years, Sony (of Japan) operated in Slovakia, first in Trnava, where it produced flat-screen television sets from 2006, and, from 2008, in Nitra, where it built the world’s largest television factory, at a cost of €100m., employing about 3,500 people. Initial average annual production doubled to some 4m. units. In 2011 the Taiwanese firm Foxconn acquired a 90% stake in the Nitra plant and continued to manufacture televisions under the Sony name. In 2002 Samsung (of South Korea) commenced operations in the western town of Galanta, opening a plant to manufacture computer monitors and television sets, to employ some 4,000 people by the end of 2008. The plant, Samsung’s main European production centre, could produce 4m. liquid crystal display (LCD) televisions annually. In 2006 Samsung opened a logistics centre nearby distribute its products made in Slovakia and Hungary, and in 2007 it spent €320m. on opening a new factory to produce LCD flat-screens, creating some 1,200 jobs and producing up to 10m. screens annually. Slovakia has also become an important centre for shared services centres and call centres. By 2011 this sector served about 50 firms, employing almost 26,000 people.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P11">EU membership led to substantial growth in the number of Slovakian nationals (particularly younger, more highly educated individuals) migrating to other member states in search of work. This was partly the result of high youth unemployment. In 2013 about 600,000 Slovakian nationals lived abroad, mainly in the Czech Republic (290,000), Germany (67,000) and the UK (62,000). Some 40,000 lived in the USA and Canada. According to estimates by the Slovakian Government, in 2016-18 about 150,000 Slovakians were working abroad, mainly in construction, health care services and industry, although some sources estimated that the true number was closer to 250,000. The UK’s withdrawal from the EU in January 2020 (Brexit) and the COVID-19 pandemic reduced net emigration, as many people returned to Slovakia in response to economic hardship and others decided not to go abroad. By contrast, since 2004, when Slovakia joined the EU, the number of foreign nationals registered as living in the country had risen from some 22,000 to over 93,000.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P12">Slovakia relies heavily on trade and records one of the highest ratios of trade to GDP within the EU, at 190% in 2018 and 195.2% in early 2022. Since 2004 the EU has been Slovakia’s largest trading partner. In 2022 other EU countries accounted for 62% of the country’s imports and 80% of exports. Following independence, trade with the West increased at the expense of the Russian Federation and the other post-Soviet states; although Russia remained a major source of imports (particularly fuel), contributing 10.2% of imports in 2013, this proportion fell to 5.6% by 2019, after the imposition of EU sanctions against Russia in response to its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. In 2021 price increases for Russian oil and gas raised Russia’s share of total imports to 7.4%, but exports to Russia represented just 1.6% of the total. Following the imposition of wide-ranging sanctions against Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, in that year imports from Russia rose by 47% to 7.7% of the total, while exports fell by 59% to just 0.5%. Within the EU, Germany is Slovakia’s largest trading partner, accounting for 13.8% of imports and 21.0% of exports in 2022. Until 2009 Slovakia had a persistent trade deficit, but subsequently the overall trade balance has been positive, mainly owing to revenue from exports of manufactured goods. In 2021-22 the car industry alone accounted for almost 50% of exports. Trade with the Czech Republic, which represented almost one-half of all trade turnover before independence, has steadily fallen as a percentage of total trade, accounting for just 8.9% of imports and 12.0% of exports in 2022.</p>

          <heading>Energy</heading>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P13">Slovakia has few domestic energy sources: imported coal, petroleum and gas supply almost two-thirds of primary energy consumption. The steel industry relies on imports of coal, which consequently remains an important part of the energy mix. Although plans exist to end reliance on coal in steel making, the costs may be as high as €1,500m. Russia is the main supplier of gas and oil. Slovakia is traversed by oil and gas pipelines that are supplied by Russia. From the early 2000s Slovakia’s supplies of gas and oil from Russia were repeatedly interrupted by disputes between Russia and, respectively, Ukraine and Belarus, the countries through which Russian oil and gas is transported en route to Slovakia. In 2009 gas supplies were suspended for almost two weeks, forcing industrial firms to halt production, and leaving much of the country without heat. Consequently, Slovakia reassessed its energy strategy. The Government adopted legislation allowing it to use gas from the stocks of private firms in an emergency, and permitting it to halt flows to third countries. SPP (the Slovak Gas Co) took measures to diversify its sources of supply, signing a 10-year agreement with E.ON Ruhrgas (of Germany) in June 2009 providing for the delivery of 500m. cu m of gas annually. In October SPP signed a five-year agreement with French energy company GDF Suez for supplies of up to 500m. cu m of gas annually, with the result that some 20% of annual consumption would come from non-Russian sources. A 113-km bi-directional gas pipeline was built between Hungary and Slovakia, allowing imports from Croatia. The construction of a 162-km link with Poland, the Poland Slovakia Gas Interconnector, which will allow gas to be supplied from a terminal in the Baltic port of Świnoujście, began in 2018, and the link opened in 2023. In addition, the oil and gas storage firm Nafta expanded natural gas storage capacity to reach 2,500m. cu m by 2014.</p>
          <p>In May 2022, in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, the EU announced plans to halt most imports of Russian oil and natural gas. Imports of gas, crude oil and oil products were largely to cease by the end of that year, but Slovakia and Hungary were offered an extension to at least the end of 2023 because of their particularly high reliance on Russian supplies. Despite this, Slovakia succeeded in rapidly diversifying its sources of gas. In 2022 70% of its gas supplies were from Russia, but this fell to just 36% in 2023. In addition, in mid-2023 Ukraine started to receive gas from alternative sources via Slovakia. Even without sanctions and import bans, this shift in supply was likely to have occurred: in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, gas from Russia is three times as harmful as that exported from the USA, and almost 10 times as harmful as that from Norway.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P14">In 2002 the Government sold 49% of the shares in companies of the energy sector, as part of a policy of privatizing natural monopolies, including oil and natural gas firms, pipeline operators, refineries and electricity generators. A 49% share in the oil pipeline operator Transpetrol was sold for US&#160;$74m. to the Russian company Yukos (subsequently acquired by the Russian state), which assumed management of the firm. However, in 2009 the Slovakian Government repurchased this share, gaining 100% control of the firm. Between 2000 and 2003 the Hungarian MOL—Magyar Olaj és Gázipari Rt (Hungarian Oil and Gas Co) purchased 70.2% of the national refinery enterprise, Slovnaft. In total, the sale of the energy enterprises raised $3,403m. in 2000-03. However, end-user prices for gas and electricity are controlled by the Government, which aims to keep them as low as possible. </p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P15">Slovakia relies heavily on nuclear power, which generates about 60% of domestic electricity production. Thermal power, mainly from natural gas, generates about 22%, and hydropower 14.5%. Nuclear power has been produced for commercial use since 1972. The Government completed a hydroelectric plant at Gabčíkovo-Nagymoros and opened two nuclear reactors at Mochovce in 1998, despite the objections of Austria. As part of the accession agreement with the EU, the Slovakian authorities agreed to decommission two Soviet-era reactors at Jaslovské Bohunice. Coal production, at just one mine, mainly of brown coal (lignite) meets about two-thirds of domestic requirements. Lignite is used mainly to produce electricity at the Nováky power plant in central Slovakia. Power plants using domestically mined lignite are subsidized, although in 2019 the Government announced that the subsidies would end by 2023. In June 2009 Slovenské Elektrárne (SE), majority-owned by the Italian firm ENEL, signed contracts with six suppliers to build two new nuclear reactors at the Mochovce nuclear power station, at an anticipated cost of some €2,700m. The first new reactor block, Unit 3, underwent testing procedures for regulatory approval during 2019. By mid-2018 the total cost of the project had reached some €5,400m. Following further delays, Unit 3 started operations in January 2023, with Unit 4 to follow. In 2016 ENEL sold its share of the plant to SE, which claimed that construction had created over 15,000 jobs, and would result in the creation of almost 5,000 permanent jobs. Due to SE’s reliance on nuclear and hydroelectric power, 89% of its production emits no greenhouse gases. However, by 2025 two reactors at Mohovce will be 40 years old, and nearing retirement. During the reforms of the early 2000s, the management of electricity production was separated from distribution and transmission. In 2017 SE provided about 69% of electricity used, supplying three major regional transmission firms.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P16">Although energy production has increased by 20% since 1990, primary energy use has dropped by 19%, and electricity consumption by 41.4%. Carbon dioxide emissions fell by 41.2% during this period. Slovakia became self-sufficient in electricity by 1999. Since 2013 consumption has exceeded production, and in 2022 the country imported around 5% of its electricity supply.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P17">Slovakia’s changing energy mix, and the reconstruction and modernization of its industrial base have made the country more energy efficient and less polluting. Between 1990 and 2015 emissions of carbon dioxide per unit of GDP fell from 0.7&#160;kg to just 0.2&#160;kg. Overall energy intensity, measured by the consumption of energy per US&#160;$100 of GDP, fell by two-thirds, from the equivalent of 30 metric tons of oil to just 10 tons. Energy use per capita fell by 25%, and the share of renewables in primary energy production rose from under 2% to 10%. This has had a positive impact on trade balances, as well as the environment. Plans to expand reliance on nuclear energy and to end subsidies for coal were likely to accelerate this process.</p>

     <gen-section print-style="COLUMN" sllink="SLSDOC" slsdocrf="GEN-SECTREF">
          <heading>Economic and Labour Policy</heading>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P18">Upon independence in 1993, the National Bank of Slovakia pursued a strict monetary policy. From 1998 the Government pursued fiscally conservative policies, restraining spending and services. After 2002 the Dzurinda Government reformed the pensions system and extensively overhauled and simplified the tax system. Value-added tax (VAT), corporate tax and personal income taxes were fixed at a uniform rate of 19% from January 2004, and the 21 different personal income taxes were replaced by one tax. Tax reform enhanced the country’s attractiveness to foreign investors, although the tax system remained complex. Neighbouring countries followed its example, with Austria and Hungary announcing reductions in their corporate tax rates. The 2010-12 Government of Iveta Radičová implemented tax reform legislation aimed at transferring more than €1,000m. from social security contributions to income tax. As early as 2008, the `tax wedge’ (the average rate of income tax combined with social contributions paid for by both employee and employer) had fallen to below the average for countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the ratio of tax revenue to GDP to 27%, the lowest level in the EU, although since then it has risen to 348% in 2028. In 2012 the Government of Robert Fico raised corporate income tax to 23%, increased VAT to 20%, and created a higher 25% band of income tax for those earning over €34,401 annually. From 2011 a 0.4% tax was levied on bank liabilities net of insured deposits and equities, resulting in a decline in profits for the sector.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P19">Tax restructuring was related to administrative and fiscal decentralization. Until 2006 Slovakia was the most centralized country in Central and South-Eastern Europe. Since then local and regional governments have received the greatest part of income taxes collected by the state, 70.9% of which are allocated to municipal governments and 27.0% to regional ones; the remaining income-tax receipts are kept as a reserve. The national Government relies principally on excise taxes and VAT for revenue. Municipal authorities were also given the right to increase real-estate taxes, set at 4.5% in 2005. However, the health care system has suffered from persistent budget shortfalls.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P20">From early 1999 the Slovak koruna was linked to the euro as its base currency. In November 2005 Slovakia joined the EU’s exchange rate mechanism, entering the eurozone at a rate of 30.126 koruna to the euro, with effect from 1 January 2009. Ratings agencies responded by increasing the country’s credit rating. By 2008 the general government deficit had fallen to around 2% of GDP, and the ratio of tax revenue to GDP had declined to the lowest level in the EU, at 28%, and the ratio of government debt to GDP had decreased to about 27%, ensuring the country’s admission to the eurozone. In 2009, with the onset of the financial crisis, the deficit increased to 7.9%. By the end of 2013 the deficit had fallen to just under 2.8% of GDP. However, this deficit reduction was achieved at some cost. Government debt increased from the equivalent of 29.4% of GDP in 2007 to 55.4% in 2013, and spending was reduced by €1,500m. Public debt measured in terms of GDP fell steadily thereafter, representing 48.1% of GDP at the end of 2019, but rose sharply to 63.1% of GDP at the end of 2021, following the extraordinary public spending measures taken by the Government to support the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic. The budget deficit fell to the equivalent of just 0.7% of GDP in 2018—the lowest ratio since independence (although Eurostat, the EU statistical agency, expressed reservations about the quality of data), but widened to 6.2% of GDP in 2021, as a result of very high public spending resulting from the pandemic.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P21">In March 2003 the Government approved a new labour code, restricting the rights of trade unions. For the first 20 years after independence, unemployment was persistently high, peaking at 18.5% in 2002. In March 2007 the registered unemployment rate fell to below 8.9% for the first time since independence. Unemployment fell to just 6.1% at the end of 2018 and averaged 6.6% in that year. Despite the impact of the pandemic, unemployment fell to 6.0% in the second half of 2022, and averaged 6.1% in that year overall.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P22">In 2018 almost 31% of the population received some kind of state pension or state allowance, about 20% of the total receiving old-age pensions. Since January 2005 Slovakia has had a three-pillar pensions system, consisting of a `pay-as-you-go’ system as the first pillar, a mandatory, so-called capitalization pillar, fully funded by employee contributions, and a third, voluntary, pillar, also fully funded by employee contributions, managed entirely in the private sector. The second pillar comprises individual accounts managed by companies of the employee’s choice, under the supervision of the social insurance agency. The third pillar, in existence since 1996, consists of individual retirement accounts; from 1999 it was open to both employees and the self-employed. The Government and employers pay into the first and second pillars, accounting for about three-quarters of the total contribution, and employees pay the remainder.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P23">The pension scheme cost more than the Government expected. This was because pension contributions were diverted to the second pillar, but payouts for the first pillar were not reduced. Although the second pillar is popular, the head of the National Insurance Company claimed that it was disadvantageous for up to two-thirds of the 1.5m. investors. Initially, the scheme was mandatory, but it became voluntary from 2013. Following reforms implemented in 2009, second pillar pension funds have been mainly invested in safe and liquid assets, such as short-term government bonds and bank deposits. Critics have argued that this hinders the development of domestic securities markets. Moreover, the persistent deficit in the first pillar posed a threat to the stability of the pensions system. As a result, in August 2012 the Government reduced the share of automatic contributions to the second pillar to just 4% of salaries, although this was to increase by 0.25% annually until it reached 6%. The contribution to the first pillar was raised to 14%. The retirement age of 62 was increased gradually from 2017, but was not expected to reach 65 until 2038. At the end of 2017 pensions expenditure amounted to about 8.5% of GDP.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P24">Since the beginning of 1992 the domestic labour force has increased in size by some 30%. Owing to investment in new manufacturing plants, labour productivity increased rapidly, averaging almost 14% annually in large companies.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P25">Although industry has grown considerably since 1998, the creation of jobs in the services sector has been more rapid than that in industry. In 2022 the services sector engaged 65.4% of the employed labour force, compared with about 35% in 1990, and services accounted for 67.0% of GDP. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs—defined as enterprises with fewer than 250 employees) have played an important role in private sector growth in industry and services. The 531,000 SMEs existing at the end of 2015 comprised over 99.9% of all enterprises, accounting for 73% of all employment: about one-half of industrial employment, about 90% of employment in construction and wholesale trade, 70% in retail trade, 60% in road transport and 80% in commercial services. SMEs generated 53% of value added in Slovakia, and accounted for 29.3% of exports. Of the total, 96.9% were defined as micro-enterprises, with nine or fewer employees. None the less, the proportion of SMEs to the total population remains below the EU average. Changes to the tax law in 2012 have contributed to a decline in the number of self-employed, as those who have trading licences must pay a minimum of €200 per month, even if they earn no income. In 2015 a total of 32% of financing came from the EU, and another 21.3% from government grants. Just over one in three firms failed after two years.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P26">After joining the EU in 2004 Slovakia was entitled to EU structural and other funds, which in 2004-07 totalled €1,169m. In 2007-13 the country was allocated some €11,587m. from the EU, 75% of which was directed towards transport, the environment, the knowledge-based economy and the regional operating programme. Slovakia was allocated €14,000m. during the 2014-20 funding period (although it was also obliged to make financial contributions to the EU during this period). For the 2021-27 funding period, Slovakia was allocated €14,000m. However, Slovakia was one of the worst EU member states at spending its allocation: in 2023 €6,000m. in structural funds from the 2014-20 allocation remained unspent, and government expenditure on public investment lagged behind that of Slovakia’s neighbours.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P27">Although the dramatic increase in investment inflows has exacerbated Slovakia’s regional inequalities, more recent investment has been centred on Košice, the location of the Eastern Slovakian Steelworks. In 2022 Volvo announced plans to build a new factory a short distance away. The Bratislava region is ineligible for most EU aid, as its GDP per head exceeds the EU average: indeed, it is among the 10 wealthiest regions in the EU. Since 1998 aid to investors has played a major role in attracting firms to less prosperous regions. As well as tax concessions, support includes the provision of grants to firms for job creation. Investment incentives exclude the Bratislava region, and give only partial aid to the three other western-most regions. Aid is available for the purchase of technology and patent rights, for contributions to new jobs, for employee salaries, for land, buildings and machinery and also in the form of tax concessions. The Bratislava region produced 27.8% of national GDP in 2010 and 28.4% in 2021, when GDP per head in the Bratislava region was 235% of the national average. In 2021 Bratislava had the highest labour force participation rate in the country, and the lowest unemployment rate, at just 2.6%. Its average wage, at 25% above the national average, was the highest in the country. The Bratislava region accounted for almost 40% of industrial output and over one-quarter of construction, measured by value, and contains one in three of the businesses in the country. Productivity in the Bratislava region was 2.4 times the national average in 2014. </p>

          <heading>Transport</heading>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P28">The east-west disparity is partly a legacy of poor transport connections. In 2003 the Government announced plans to link existing industrial areas in the east and west of the country over a period of 30 years, to improve the main east-west international transport corridor and stimulate tourism in the Tatra mountains and to create a network of expressways in the south. When Slovakia joined the EU in 2004, there were just 394 km of express roads. EU structural funds became available for the construction of new roads and upgrading of existing ones. When Hyundai agreed to build its plant in Žilina the Government extended the motorway network to the town, supported by a loan from the European Investment Bank. A motorway between Bratislava and Vienna, Austria, opened in November 2007. By mid-2022 the motorway network was 780 km in length, with an additional 130 km under construction. To reduce costs, many new express roads are being built as single carriageways, with one lane in each direction. The northern motorway route has over 40 km of tunnels, including three that are 5 km or more in length, and required the construction of several bridges. Shortfalls in spending, and disputes over property acquisition and compensation delayed the project, but by 2023 only a few segments remained unfinished. Between 2004 and 2018 car ownership doubled, and road transport increased significantly, to 36m. ton-km, around four times the amount transported by railways.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P29">The railway network has declined slightly since the fall of communism: between 2004 and 2018 the total track length diminished by 1%. However, the railways remain unprofitable. By 2003 their debt had reached 49,520m. koruna (€1,200m.). After 1989, passenger and freight traffic fell sharply, with a decline of around one-half between 1995 and 2012. In 2002 the state railway operator, Železnice Slovenskej Republiky, which had been the second largest employer in the country, with some 19,000 employees, was divided into an infrastructure company and an operating company, Železničná Spoločnost (ŽSSK), providing freight and passenger services. In 2005 ŽSSK was, in turn, divided into a freight company, ŽSSK Cargo, and a passenger company. Consequently, the finances of rail operations became more transparent. The high operating subsidies for freight and passenger services were separated from capital costs, and profits from the cargo division no longer subsidized passenger services. By 2007 the infrastructure company had paid off its outstanding debt, but remained reliant on state support. Rail traffic was increasingly concentrated on a few principal routes, and from 2003 the Government reduced or closed services on some regional lines. Despite these changes, railway productivity remains low. Passenger rail fares are kept in check by competing bus services. Passenger services have continued to record losses, of around €4m. in 2017. In 2014 revenues met only 45% of costs, and despite an increase in passenger numbers, the share of costs covered by revenues fell to 36% in 2017. In 2008 the Slovakian authorities announced that Polish state railways freight locomotives would be allowed to operate in Slovakia. By 2016 some 30 private operators were running specialist freight services within Slovakia, and between Hungary, Austria and Ukraine. ŽSSK Cargo remained the largest operator, supplying almost one-half of freight rail transport. In March 2012 a private firm, RegioJet, began to operate trains on a 100-km line from Bratislava, with a contract to December 2020. It provided new rolling stock, train frequencies improved, and passenger numbers doubled; the Government paid a subsidy of €5.90 per train-km—€0.86 less than it had paid ŽSSK. RegioJet subsequently took over other routes, from Žilina to Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, and from Bratislava to Košice and Banská Bystrica in the eastern part of the country. Subsequently, the Czech transport company LEO Express began operating train services in Slovakia.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P30">Although located a short distance from Vienna, Bratislava Airport has struggled to establish itself as an airline hub, although it has attracted flights from `low cost’ airlines, such as Ryanair (of Ireland). In February 2006 Košice’s airport was sold to an Austrian consortium, led by Vienna International Airport, but the planned sale of Bratislava’s airport was cancelled. Instead, the Government sought a public-private partnership to operate the airport. Expansion of the airport was completed in 2010, when a new terminal was opened, with an annual capacity of 3.5m. passengers. The annual figure for passenger traffic was 1.4m. in 2012, and in December Ryanair announced its intention to establish a hub at the airport. By 2017 Ryanair operated flights to 22 destinations in 10 European countries. Five other airlines operated regular services from the airport, as did nine charter airlines. Passenger numbers reached 2.8m. by 2019, but fell sharply in 2020 after restrictions were imposed to contain the COVID pandemic. By 2022 numbers had recovered to only 1.4m. passengers.</p>

          <heading>The COVID-19 Pandemic</heading>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P31">The first case of COVID-19 was reported in the country on 6 March 2020, but the Government had already taken measures to restrict arrivals from abroad, and it rapidly imposed restrictions on movement and assembly. The COVID-19 pandemic widely affected the Slovakian economy: in 2019 GDP increased by only 2.3%, compared with a projected 3.5%. However, despite the growth of the labour force, unemployment fell to a record low of just 5.6% in the last quarter of 2019, and averaged 5.8% in that year, but rose in 2020, before falling again in 2021-22, to 6.0% in the second half of 2022. The banking sector was considered to be in good shape, particularly because the country’s banking operations are concentrated in large multinational firms with a solid level of reserves. In 2019 the non-performing loan ratio was just 3.4%.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P33">At the start of the pandemic, car manufacturers and other enterprises suspended production completely, although in some cases they were able to resume operations relatively promptly, owing to the initially successful management of the crisis in the country. GDP declined by 4.4% in 2020, but rose by 3.0% in 2021 and 3.5% in 2022. However, some industries in the services sector were particularly adversely affected: tourism and the hotel business, restaurants and food services.</p>
          <p>Several states of emergency were declared, the last one extending from 25 November 2021 to 22 February 2022, during which restrictions were placed on freedom of movement and entry to public facilities, including shops. At the end of February excess mortality during the pandemic reached 7.8%. By early April the number of new cases had moderated and nearly all COVID-19 restrictions on foreign visitors to Slovakia had been removed. </p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P34">The initial budget for 2020 aimed to restrain the budget deficit to €2,800m. However, the new Government, which took office on 21 March, announced that it would spend up to €1,000m. monthly to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. This included paying 80% of the wages of workers in companies forced to shut, and support for the self-employed and employees in affected firms. Companies were allowed to claim corporation tax relief by offsetting losses against income dating back to 2014. The Government also offered companies bank guarantees of up to €500m. monthly. The total cost of these interventions was expected to represent about 2.5% of GDP, and the loss of revenue owing to economic disruption was forecast to reach 3% of GDP in 2020. The general government deficit increased from the equivalent of 1.9% of GDP in 2019 to 5.5% in 2020. It rose to 6.2% in 2021, compared with an expected level of 7.4%. In 2020 the ratio of government debt to GDP rose from 48.1% in 2019 to 59.7% in 2021, just under the EU threshold of 60%, and reached 63.1% in 2021. In 2021 Slovakia received an additional €6,300m. in EU funding from the Recovery and Resilience Fund, of which 43% was to be spent on climate objectives, and 21% on supporting a digital transition.</p>

          <heading>Prospects</heading>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P35">Slovakia has represented a test case for the benefits of political and economic reform and foreign investment after the fall of communism, and became a leading beneficiary of globalization. It has transformed from an underdeveloped region of a larger country to a leading manufacturing power in its own right, with a modern and expanding industrial base, particularly in aluminium, iron, steel, white goods, televisions and cars. Slovakia has transformed from a state-owned, centrally planned economy to a private, market-orientated economic system, and from an economy based on ageing and obsolete industries to one based on services and modern technology. The country has restructured its banking sector, reorganized its legal system and administration, and strengthened the powers of local and regional governments. Aided by a liberal tax regime and the aggressive promotion of investment incentives, FDI has increased significantly, and the country has recorded one of the highest rates of growth since 1989 in the EU. It has evolved from being a pariah state, excluded from the OECD, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the EU accession process, to a country with full membership of all of these institutions. Independence allowed the country to adopt its own taxation and monetary policies, and to find new markets and investment. Although business executives claim that undue influence still plays a role in economic success, the international financial community, including the OECD and the EU, have praised Slovakia’s economic policies. In 2010-11 Slovakia made available €440m. to the IMF, becoming a net lender to the organization. In addition, it pledged €4,300m. to the European Financial Stability Facility in 2010, and an additional €7,700m. to the concurrent European Financial Stabilization Mechanism in October 2011.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P36">Reform took place at some cost. Unemployment initially rose to unprecedented levels. In the early 2000s it was estimated that some 600,000 people lived in extreme poverty. Salaries declined in real terms in the late 1990s, and again in 2003, in 2006, and in 2011-12, although overall during 1992-2017 the average monthly wage grew from €131.5 to €954. In several sectors pay remains low. EU membership and the abolition of many frontier regulations drew the country closer to the European `heartland’, resulting in significantly accelerated economic growth. However, regional disparities within the country have grown between the western one-third of the country and areas further east.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P37">The objective of joining the eurozone in 2009 constrained the Government’s freedom of action, but eurozone membership led to lower domestic interest rates. The economic crisis of 2008-13 compelled the country to increase spending, resulting in a sharp increase in the budget deficit, to almost 7% of GDP in 2009. Unemployment rose, but not to the extreme levels of the previous decade. Despite this, the country’s underlying economic situation remained strong. The budget deficit fell to just under 2.8% of GDP in 2013, and to 0.7% in 2018. It rose again during the pandemic, but averaged just 2.0% for 2022. In 2023, however, the deficit was expected to reach 6.1%, before falling back to 4.8% in 2024. Inflation has been low since Slovakia joined the eurozone, and in several years prices actually declined on a monthly basis. However, during 2021-22 inflation rose sharply, averaging 12.8% in 2022, up from 3.2% in 2021. This was higher than the overall eurozone average, but lower than the rates in neighbouring Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland. It was projected to average 10.9% in 2023 and 5.7% in 2024. Public debt was 48.9% of GDP in 2018 (although Eurostat expressed reservations about the quality of the data), but rose sharply following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, to over 60%, as the Government increased public spending dramatically to support the economy, but fell to 57.8% in 2022. The European Commission expected the debt-to-GDP ratio to remain at around 58% during 2024, and GDP to grow by 1.7% in 2023 and 2.1% in 2024. Foreign investment in the country continued and, despite wage increases, the labour force remained competitive. Slovakia’s growth rate continues to exceed that of the average in the EU and the eurozone.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P38">Although Slovakia’s transport infrastructure, particularly high-speed roads, has improved, government plans envisage further development. Unemployment levels have continued to fall, while the size of the labour force has grown. However, the country remains hampered by regional disparities and, as the resignation of the Fico Government in March 2018 following an escalation in anti-Government protests has shown, by corruption at all levels of government. Tax collection remains inefficient: it has been estimated that there is a gap of 25% between expected and actual VAT collections. Public trust in the judiciary and the legal system is low, and corruption is believed to be widespread. The efficiency and quality of government services are also a source of discontent. In 2018 home purchase accounted for 80% of household borrowing, and the ratio of household debt to income rose from 30% to 78% between 2006 and 2016, remaining a potential problem. Historically low interest rates have both encouraged borrowing and contributed to a price bubble in some housing markets.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P39">The Government that took office in March 2020, under the premiership of Igor Matovič, had a relatively reformist orientation. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Government took unprecedented and costly steps to support the national economy. The resignation of Matovič and his replacement by Eduard Heger in April 2021 did not bring about a substantial change in the economic policy outlook.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P40">Slovakia’s reliance on exports means that its economic prospects are linked to those of its main trading partners. Slovakia’s industrial profile makes it particularly vulnerable to economic shocks. Four sub-sectors—transport, machinery, chemicals, and metals—account for over 80% of exports, and directly or indirectly provide 30% of employment and 40% of output. Given its relatively small size, the country depends heavily on trade: in 2018 the cost of imports was equivalent to 94% of GDP and exports 96%. The market for Slovakian exports consists of just a few geographical regions: the EU accounts for 80% of the total. The automotive industry, Slovakia’s largest manufacturing sector, is particularly vulnerable. It is dominated by four manufacturers—Kia Motors, Stellantis, Volkswagen and Jaguar Land Rover. Although the quality of products has improved since 2000 in the main, components are sent to Slovakia for final product assembly, and the shipment of intermediate inputs to other countries to be assembled into final products has remained relatively stable. Moreover, despite a developed network of suppliers, Slovakia is a net importer of car parts. Despite this, the transport sector and the electrical and machinery sector affect other sectors in Slovakia. In 2018 car production accounted for 17% of metallurgy output and 27% of textile output. Machinery used 23% of metal output and 18% of chemical output.</p>
          <p>Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 created several new threats to the Slovakian economy. Although Slovakia uses nuclear and hydropower to generate most of its electricity, the car, iron and steel, and chemical industries are reliant on natural gas, oil and coal. Despite efforts to diversify imports, including gas pipelines to Poland and Western Europe, until 2021 almost all Slovakia’s oil and gas imports were provided by Russia, leaving Slovakia vulnerable to the cessation of supplies. However, by 2023 alternative sources and channels of supply had met almost three-quarters of domestic needs. Global energy shortages have compounded difficulties, driving up inflation and making manufacturing more costly. Over the past decade Slovakia’s car manufacturing supply chains expanded into Ukraine, but the continuing war has interrupted these. In March 2022 the Government adopted legislation to allow it to accept Ukrainian refugees. By mid-2023 over 1m. Ukrainian refugees had passed through Slovakia and more than 100,000 had applied for temporary protection, with significant costs to the economy. Nevertheless, by increasing demand for goods and services, the refugees have contributed to economic growth.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P41">
      Slovakia successfully weathered the COVID-19 pandemic, and has successfully managed the economic and political stresses resulting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Its economic prospects seem favourable. The UK’s departure from the EU has resulted in increased car production in Slovakia: Jaguar Land Rover ha
      
      d already implemented plans to transfer manufacturing from the UK, with the opening of a new plant in October 2018. As a consequence, continued growth in Slovakia’s economy seems likely in the medium term. However, such growth depends on developments in Slovakia’s neighbours and trading partners, and therefore on the regional and global impact of the war in Ukraine.
