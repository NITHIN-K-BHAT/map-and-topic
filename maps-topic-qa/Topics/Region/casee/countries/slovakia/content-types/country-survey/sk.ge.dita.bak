          <p id="SK.GEOG.1">The Slovak Republic, or Slovakia, is bordered to the west by the Czech Republic (Czechia), to the north by Poland, to the east by Ukraine, to the south by Hungary and to the south-west by Austria. The country covers an area of 49,034 sq&#160;km (18,932 sq miles).</p>
          <p id="SK.GEOG.2">The terrain is largely mountainous, rising in the north to Slovakia’s highest point, Gerlach (Gerlachovský) Peak (2,655&#160;m—8,711&#160;ft), in the High Tatras. The High Tatras (Vysoké Tatry), on the northern border with Poland, and the Low Tatras (Nízke Tatry), in the centre and east, are the principal mountain ranges. They form the westernmost branch of the Carpathian mountain chain. The mountains are drained by numerous rivers, flowing south to the lowland areas, including the Váh, the Nitra, the Hron and the Hornád. Part of the southern border is marked by the River Danube (Dunaj). There are lowland areas in the south-west and south-east of the country, which are extensions of the Pannonian Plain and are the main areas for settlement and agriculture. More than two-fifths of Slovakia is forested, and only one-third is cultivated land.</p>

          <heading>Climate</heading>
          <p id="SK.GEOG.3">The climate is of a typical continental type, with average temperatures in Bratislava varying from −0.7°C (30.7°F) in January to 21.1°C (70.0°F) in July. However, average tem­peratures in the mountainous centre of the country are as much as 10°C lower. Temperature inversions during the winter frequently cause pollution problems in the more populous and industrialized areas. Average annual rainfall in Bratislava is 649&#160;mm.</p>

          <heading>Population</heading>
          <p id="SK.GEOG.4">According to results of the census held on 1 January 2021, the total population of Slovakia was 5,449,270. At the end of 2022, according to official estimates, the population numbered 5,428,792, giving a population density of 110.7 per sq&#160;km. At the 2021 census, 83.8% of the country’s inhabitants were ethnic Slovaks, 7.8% were Hungarians, who are concentrated along the southern border with Hungary, 1.2% were Gypsy (Roma), 0.6% were Ruthenians or Ukrainians, and 0.6% were Czechs (including Moravians and Silesians). There were also small communities of Germans and Poles. Slovak, a member of the Western Slavonic group of languages, closely related to Czech, is the official lan­guage. There are Hungarian-language newspapers and periodicals and Hungarian-lang­uage broadcasting. Other languages may be used for official purposes in areas where at least 20% of the population are native speakers of those languages. Christianity is the major religion, the Roman Catholic Church (principally of the Latin rite) being the largest denomination.</p>
