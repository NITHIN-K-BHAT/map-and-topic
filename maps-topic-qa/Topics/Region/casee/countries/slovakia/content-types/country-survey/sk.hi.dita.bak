          <heading>Introduction</heading>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P1">Slavic tribes arrived in the territory now called Slovakia in the sixth or seventh centuries, but from the 10th century until 1918 the territory was under Hungarian rule. The transport infrastructure and economy of Slovakia became orientated towards Budapest, the leading Hungarian city, while the Czech Lands (Bohemia and Moravia) were orientated towards Vienna, the imperial capital of Austria. In the 19th century, particularly after the Austro-Hungarian Ausgleich (Compromise) of 1867, the Hungarians instituted a policy of `magyarization’, which prompted large-scale emigration, particularly to the USA. Slovak was recognized as a distinct language in the mid-19th century. During the First World War Slovaks and Czechs campaigned for an independent state, composed of the Czech Lands and Slovakia. In 1918 leading campaigners in the USA signed the Czech-Slovak Pittsburgh Agreement, in which the Czech and Slovak exile groups agreed to create a common, democratic state.</p>

          <heading>Czechoslovakia 1918-38</heading>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P2">The Pittsburgh Agreement envisaged autonomy for Slovakia, but Czechoslovakia’s first Constitution, promulgated in 1920, did not provide for a federal system. During the First Republic (1918-38) the authorities in Prague, the capital, in the Czech Lands, rejected proposals to grant Slovakia genuine self-government, and Slovakia was just one of four administrative regions. The Czech Lands experienced considerable economic development between the First and Second World Wars, but in Slovakia per-head incomes were only 42% of the Czech average. </p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P3">The Czechoslovak Government was dominated by Czech interests, and disregarded problems that were specific to Slovakia, leading to an independence movement supported by nationalist parties. The main party, the Hlinkova Slovenská Ľudová Strana-Strana Slovenskej Národnej Jednoty (HSĽS-SSNJ—Hlinka’s Slovak National People’s Party-Party of Slovak National Unity), fused elements of fascism with Roman Catholicism and nationalism. In October 1938, following the Munich Agreement (which awarded the Czechoslovak Sudetenland territories to Germany) and the end of the First Republic, the HSĽS-SSNJ declared autonomy for Slovakia and banned all other political groups.</p>

          <heading>Wartime Slovakia</heading>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P4">In November 1938 Hungary annexed southern parts of Slovakia where the population was predominantly Hungarian. On 14 March 1939 (the day before the German occupation of the remaining Czech Lands) the German leader, Adolf Hitler, agreed to the establishment of a separate Slovak state, under the leadership of Mgr Jozef Tiso, a Slovak nationalist and Catholic priest. Slovakia became independent for the first time. The wartime Slovak state (March 1939-April 1945) was inspired by a combination of German Nazi and Italian fascist principles. Opposition to the Tiso regime was ruthlessly suppressed. The treatment of Jews, especially after the adoption of a `Jewish Code’ in 1941, was particularly severe. Between March and October 1942 an estimated 58,000 Jews and several thousand Roma were deported to extermination camps. In August 1944 an armed uprising against the HSĽS-SSNJ regime began. It lasted two months before being suppressed by German troops, who were invited into Slovakia by Tiso. Despite its failure, the Slovak National Rising provided legitimacy for pro-independence, anti-Tiso, Slovaks. However, the Czechoslovakian Government-in-Exile would not grant autonomy to Slovakia in a post-Second World War state because of its collaboration with Nazi Germany. Slovakia and the Czech Lands were reunited, and most Slovak territory seized by Hungary was returned to Czechoslovak control. After the communist takeover, the authorities portrayed the uprising as a communist-led endeavour, undertaken with the support of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, although communist partisans represented just a small number of those who participated.</p>

          <heading>Czechoslovakia 1945-89</heading>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P5">In 1948 Slovakia contained almost 28% of the population of Czechoslovakia, producing under 20% of the country’s income, under 14% of industrial output and almost 31% of agricultural output. On the pretext of preventing the re-emergence of supporters of the Tiso regime, the communists seized power in Slovakia in 1947, and took control of all of Czechoslovakia in 1948. They harshly suppressed any expression of Slovak nationalism, and Tiso was hanged. The communist coup in Slovakia was led by Gustáv Husák, later to be General Secretary of the Komunistická Strana Československa (KSČ—Czechoslovak Communist Party).</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P6">In the 1960s, with the appointment of the reformist Alexander Dubček (a Slovak) as leader of the Komunistická Strana Slovenska (KSS—Communist Party of Slovakia), Slovakian autonomy re-emerged as a subject of debate. In 1968 the Czechoslovak Government agreed to create a federal system of two equal republics. Despite the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968, a federal system was introduced on 1 January 1969. Slovakia became the Slovak Socialist Republic, with its own Government, and the Slovakian Národná Rada (National Council) was granted wide constitutional powers. However the reimposition of centralized communist rule rendered these new institutions powerless.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P7">The communist Government pursued a policy of industrializing Slovakia. The state made a concerted effort to distribute employment and production so as to reflect the relative proportions of population between the Czech and Slovakia republics, seeking to eliminate differences in wages and living standards. By 1989 the Slovak Republic contained 34% of the federation’s population, and produced 30% of its national income, 33% of its gross agricultural output and almost 30% of gross industrial output. Labour productivity increased from 62% of the Czech average to 96%, and the average wage reached 99% of the Czech average.</p>

          <heading>The Czech and Slovak Federal Republic 1989-92</heading>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P8">In November 1989 Czechoslovakia’s `Velvet Revolution’ ended communist rule. The Republic became the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, within which the Czech Republic and Slovakia had equal administrative status. However, Czechs dominated policymaking. Federal policies were adopted regardless of their regional consequences and before a consensus had been reached on how to mitigate their effects. They led to a sharp increase in Slovak unemployment and to widespread economic hardship. They fostered the rise of a populist, nationalist political orientation among Slovak political parties and the electorate. Vladimír Mečiar, who had been expelled from the KSS after 1968, became a member of Slovakia’s first post-communist Government in January 1990. Six months later, following the holding of democratic Czechoslovakian elections, he became premier of Slovakia. By April 1991 Mečiar had founded the Hnutie za Demokratické Slovensko (HZDS—Movement for a Democratic Slovakia), which became the dominant party in the Slovakian legislature, winning 74 of the 150 seats (with 37% of votes cast) in elections in June 1992. Mečiar was again appointed Prime Minister of Slovakia, and relentlessly moved the republic towards independence. On 17 July the Slovakian National Council approved a declaration of Slovakian sovereignty by a substantial majority. The Slovak Republic became a sovereign nation on 1 January 1993, as did the Czech Republic.</p>

          <heading>Independence and the Governments of Mikuláš Dzurinda 1998-2006</heading>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P9">Mečiar served as Prime Minister from 1993 until November 1998, with a short period out of office, pursuing nationalist, anti-reform policies. The authorities intimidated political opponents, harassed the press, exerted control over the state-owned media and undermined the independence of government institutions. With the exception of a brief period from March to October 1994, the HZDS remained the largest party in the National Council, and established an alliance with the extreme nationalist Slovenská Národná Strana (SNS—Slovak National Party) and the left-wing Združenie Robotnikov Slovenska (Union of Workers of Slovakia).</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P10">Infighting among opposition politicians and the existence of numerous small parties enabled Mečiar to maintain his hold on power. However, after the collapse of the Russian rouble in 1998 many large enterprises ceased paying their debts, and some stopped paying wages. Unemployment, which had been falling, began to rise. At the September 1998 legislative elections, the electorate moved away from Mečiar’s party, although it secured the largest share of the popular vote (27%, and 43 seats). The only party represented in parliament willing to co-operate with Mečiar was the SNS, which won 9.1% of the votes cast (14 seats). With 93 seats in the 150-strong chamber, the multi-party Slovenská Demokratická Koalícia (SDK—Slovak Democratic Coalition), the Strana Demokratickej Ľavice (SDĽ—Party of the Democratic Left—the successor to the KSS), the Magyar Koalíció Pártja (MKP—Party of the Hungarian Coalition) and the Strana Občianskeho Porozumenia (Party of Civic Understanding) formed a coalition administration. A Government, led by Mikuláš Dzurinda, the Chairman of the SDK, was appointed on 30 October. The legislative elections of September 2002 confirmed Dzurinda’s hold on power, although the coalition’s majority was reduced to three seats.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P11">The new Government’s priorities were economic reform and attaining Slovakian membership of the European Union (EU), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Until 2004, the legislative and political agenda was dominated by the need to meet EU accession criteria. Many policies from this period imposed economic hardship on various segments of the population. Dzurinda’s Government reprivatized banks and privatized major state-owned utilities. Within a few years Slovakia moved from near the bottom of the league, in terms of per-head foreign investment in former socialist states, to near the top. The country joined the OECD in December 2000, NATO in March 2004 and the EU in May 2004. The referendum on EU membership, held on 16-17 May 2003, was the first in the history of independent Slovakia to attract more than 50% of the electorate (and thus be constitutionally valid); 92.5% of votes were cast in favour of membership. On 1 July the National Council approved the Treaty of Accession. Immediately following accession, opinion polls indicated that 77.6% of respondents favoured membership and only 17.5% opposed it. However, in the country’s first elections to the European Parliament, on 13 June, only 17.0% of the electorate voted—the lowest rate of participation in any EU member state.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P12">Owing to political infighting, by December 2005 Dzurinda’s ruling coalition controlled just 67 seats in the 150-member National Council. In early February 2006 the coalition collapsed, after the Kresťanskodemokratické Hnutie (KDH—Christian Democratic Movement) withdrew its support from the Government. Dzurinda announced that legislative elections would be held in June, three months earlier than originally scheduled.</p>

          <heading>The Government of Robert Fico 2006-10</heading>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P13">
      In 1999 a new party, Direction (Smer), was established by Robert Fico, a former member of the communist 
      <i>nomenklatura</i>
      , who later served as Slovakia’s representative at the European Court of Human Rights. Initially a centre-right party, Smer adopted an increasingly populist stance. In January 2005 Smer merged with the SDĽ; although the latter party lacked popular support, its legacy as the heir of the KSS made it one of the country’s wealthiest and most well-organized parties. This allowed Smer to position itself as a social democratic party, and it changed its name to Smer-Sociálna Demokracia (Smer-SD—Smer-Social Democracy). Meanwhile, in June 2003 the HZDS was renamed the Ľudová Strana—Hnutie za Demokratické Slovensko (ĽS—HZDS—People’s Party—Movement for a Democratic Slovakia). In legislative elections held in June 2006, Smer-SD replaced the ĽS—HZDS as the main party of the left, securing 50 seats in the National Council, with 29.1% of the vote. The Slovenská Demokratická a Kresťanská Únia-Demokratická Strana (SDKÚ-DS—Slovak Democratic and Christian Union-Democratic Party) was second, with 31 seats, ahead of the SNS (20 seats), the MKP (also 20 seats), the ĽS—HZDS (15 seats) and the KDH (14 seats). The rate of voter participation was 54.7%. On 20 June President Ivan Gašparovič invited Fico to form a new government; Smer-SD, the SNS and the ĽS—HZDS established a coalition. Responding to criticism at the inclusion of Mečiar’s ĽS—HZDS and the extreme nationalist SNS, led by Ján Slota, in his Government, Fico promised that the leaders of those parties would not hold high office in the administration, although they would form a `coalition council’ with him. The Government comprised 11 representatives from Smer-SD, three from the SNS and two from the ĽS—HZDS.
    </p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P14">The Fico Government had an adversarial relationship with the press. In April 2008 new legislation allowed the right of response to anyone who believed that they had been unjustly defamed in the media, regardless of whether or not the material was true. Fico often refused to grant interviews to outlets perceived as pro-opposition, and in early 2008 Gašparovič suggested that the Government should own its own media. It was widely perceived that the Government had interfered in the management of the state-owned television network, Slovenská Televízia (STV), leading to the replacement of several senior news staff.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P15">Strains developed between Smer-SD and the ĽS—HZDS, both due to personal antipathy between Fico and Mečiar, and because Smer-SD was steadily capturing support from the ĽS—HZDS. In 2009 two new centrist parties emerged: former MKP leaders created a new party, known by the bilingual Slovak-Hungarian designation Most/Híd (Bridge), which aimed to promote reconciliation among all ethnic groups and favoured a stronger emphasis on social welfare. The other new party, Sloboda a Solidarita (SaS—Freedom and Solidarity), was founded by Richard Sulík, a business executive and former adviser to the Minister of Finance. Arguing that the established political parties were reluctant to undertake political reforms, SaS called for a reduction in the size and powers of the legislature and its deputies.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P16">In the 2009 presidential election the opposition parties presented a single candidate, Iveta Radičová of the SDKÚ-DS. Gašparovič, the incumbent, was supported by Smer-SD and the SNS. Of the seven candidates to participate in the first round of voting, held on 21 March, Gašparovič and Radičová advanced to the `run off’ poll on 4 April; Gašparovič was re-elected as President, receiving 55.5% of the votes cast, with 51.7% of the electorate participating.</p>

     <gen-section print-style="COLUMN" sllink="SLSDOC" slsdocrf="GEN-SECTREF">
          <heading>The Government of Iveta Radičová 2010-12</heading>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P17">In advance of legislative elections scheduled for 12 June 2010, Dzurinda declined to lead the SDKÚ-DS’s electoral list, after he was alleged to have illegally received funds, ceding that position to Radičová. The elections, in which 58.8% of the electorate voted, demonstrated a clear shift in support to the right, amid growing concerns about the domestic economy. Smer-SD won 34.8% of the votes, securing 62 seats in the National Council, but the SNS’s share of the votes fell to just 5.1% (nine seats) and the ĽS—HZDS failed to meet the 5% quota required for parliamentary representation. The SDKÚ-DS obtained 28 seats, SaS 22, the KDH 15 seats and Most/Híd 14. In total, the four parties of the centre-right secured 79 seats. President Gašparovič initially invited Fico, as the leader of the largest party in the new legislature, to form a government. However, he was unable to do so, and the mandate was transferred to Radičová. On 6 July the SDKÚ-DS, the KDH, SaS and Most/Híd reached a coalition agreement. A new Government, led by Radičová and comprising representatives of all four coalition parties, was appointed on 9 July; prominent ministers included Dzurinda, who received the foreign affairs portfolio.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P18">In May 2011 Radičová announced that Slovakia would contribute to the newly created European Financial Stabilization Mechanism (EFSM). However, on 11 October coalition member SaS boycotted a parliamentary vote to avoid endorsing the EFSM, causing the collapse of the Government. After agreeing to a demand by Fico to schedule early elections for March 2012, Radičová secured parliamentary approval of the EFSM, with the support of Smer-SD, in a second vote on 13 October 2011.</p>

          <heading>Fico Returns to Power</heading>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P19">Legislative elections took place on 10 March 2012. Smer-SD achieved a resounding victory, receiving 44.4% of the total votes, which gave it 83 seats—sufficient for it to govern without a coalition partner. The KDH came second, with 8.8% of the votes and 16 seats. A new centrist party, Obyčajní Ľudia a Nezávislé Osobnosti (OĽaNO—Ordinary People and Independent Personalities), secured 8.6% of the votes and 16 seats. Most/Híd was fourth, with 13 seats, and the SDKÚ-DS fifth, with 11 seats. SaS’s support fell sharply, and it too obtained 11 seats. The SNS, the MKP and the ĽS—HZDS failed to obtain representation, the latter’s share of the vote falling to just 1.6%. On 3 April Gašparovič appointed Fico as Prime Minister. The following day a Government principally composed of members of Smer-SD was installed (becoming the first single-party administration since 1993).</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P20">On assuming office, Fico announced that he sought to create a `modern and thrifty state that intervenes in the economy only when reasonably necessary and avoids approaches that deform the market’. He pledged to support the EU and the European Central Bank in their efforts to protect the euro, and added that he was committed to reducing Slovakia’s budgetary deficit to below the EU’s ceiling of 3% of gross domestic product in 2013. The flat rate of taxation introduced in 2004 was abandoned, and taxes on bank deposits, corporate taxes and the income taxes of higher earners were increased.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P21">The first round of the 2014 presidential election took place on 15 March; 14 candidates participated, as the opposition parties could not agree on a common candidate. Smer-SD nominated Fico as its representative. In the first round Fico won 28.0% of the votes cast, followed by an independent candidate, Andrej Kiska, with 24.0%. In the run-off poll between the two leading candidates, held on 29 March, Kiska won with 59.4% of the votes. Observers suggested that Kiska’s election reflected popular mistrust of established political parties and widespread frustration with political scandals and alleged corruption, and fears that, should its members control both the legislature and the presidency, Smer-SD would become too powerful. Kiska was a businessman and philanthropist with no political background. He demanded measures to enhance the rule of law and strengthen the independence of the judiciary, and argued that there was need for a balance between the legislature and the President.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P22">In the May 2014 elections to the European Parliament, Smer-SD won 24.1% of the votes cast, ahead of the KDH, with 13.2%, and the SDKÚ-DS, with 7.8%; OĽaNO received 7.5% of the votes cast, and the conservative Nová Väčšina—Dohoda (NOVA—New Majority—Agreement) 6.8%. However, the political scene remained in flux: Slovakia’s 13 representatives were shared among eight parties, and the rate of participation was only 13.1%. The results of local government elections held concurrently, in which 48.3% of the electorate voted, indicated an even more confused political picture. Smer-SD proved the most popular political party, winning 29% of the more than 2,900 elected mayorships. Elected mayors represented 143 different local coalitions of political parties and independent candidates won 38% of the contested posts. Among the candidates for almost 21,000 local government councillors, there were 179 different party combinations. Of those standing for election, 29% ran as independents and around 25% as Smer-SD candidates. Elections for regional governments, held in November 2013, had resulted in a similar pattern, when Smer-SD obtained around 29% of the total vote, but with a turnout of just 20.1%.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P24">In legislative elections held in March 2016, eight parties secured the minimum 5% of votes cast to achieve representation in the National Council. The electorate supported two nationalist, populist parties at the expense of Smer-SD, reflecting growing concerns about immigration, the future of Greece in the eurozone, and the overall economy. The Smer-SD share of the vote fell from 44.4% in 2012 to 28.3% in 2016, with 49 seats, representing a loss of 34 seats. SaS received 12.1% of the votes and 21 seats (a gain of 10 seats) and OĽaNO, which had allied with NOVA to contest the elections, 11.0% of the votes and 19 seats (a gain of three seats). The SNS secured 8.6% of the votes and 15 seats. An extreme nationalist party led by Marian Kotleba, Kotleba—Ľudová Strana Naše Slovensko (ĽSNS, Kotleba—Our Slovakia People’s Party), which claimed to be a descendant of the wartime political movement led by Andrej Hlinka and Tiso, obtained 8.0% (14 seats). Notably, the party opposed Slovakia’s membership of the eurozone, the EU and NATO, and favoured the introduction of severe restrictions on immigration and the imposition of `Christian morality’. The KDH fell narrowly short of the threshold for representation, and the SDKÚ-DS received only 0.3% of the votes. Two new centre-right parties entered parliament: Sme Rodina (We are Family) and Sieť (Network). Sme Rodina, which gained 6.6% of the votes and 11 seats, had been formed in late 2015 under the leadership of Boris Kollár, who described himself as `not a professional politician’, and claimed that his personal wealth would inhibit him from participating in corrupt practices. Sieť received 5.6% of the votes and 10 seats, and Most/Híd won 6.5% of the votes and 11 seats. On 17 March Fico announced that he had formed a coalition Government comprising four parties: Smer-SD, Sieť, the SNS and Most/Híd. However, following the decision to join the Smer-SD-led coalition, most Sieť legislative deputies left the party and it fell apart. A modified, three-party coalition agreement was signed in September.</p>

          <heading>Anti-corruption Protests</heading>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P25">From mid-2017 the Government attracted considerable public criticism as a result of corruption allegations. The Minister of the Interior, Robert Kaliňák, was accused of making illicit business deals with a real estate developer accused of tax evasion of over €8m., prompting mass demonstrations in Bratislava. Anti-corruption protesters demanded that Kaliňák resign, but he refused, and retained the support of Prime Minister Fico.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P26">Anti-Government protests escalated in February 2018, after the murder of an investigative journalist, Ján Kuciak, and his fiancée. Kuciak had been investigating corruption cases concerning businessmen with political ties, and links between Italian nationals living in eastern Slovakia and the Ndrangheta organized criminal network based in southern Italy. Kuciak claimed that they were implicated in the embezzlement of EU structural funds. In March the Prosecutor-General described the murders as contract killings. Several opposition politicians accused Smer-SD of being indirectly involved, and Most/Híd threatened to leave the governing coalition. On 28 February, two days after the discovery of the bodies, the Prime Minister and the national head of police announced a reward of €1m. for information about the murders.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P27">On 2 March 2018 some 25,000 people protested against corruption in Bratislava. On 9 March the protests spread to cities across Slovakia and in the Czech Republic. These represented the largest anti-Government demonstrations in the country since 1989, with the protest in Bratislava alone attracting an estimated 60,000 people. President Kiska demanded that Fico either effect an extensive cabinet reorganization or announce early parliamentary elections. On 12 March 2018 Kaliňák resigned as Minister of the Interior, and on 15 March Fico tendered the resignation of his administration. The Deputy Prime Minister, responsible for Investment and Informatization, Peter Pellegrini, formed a new administration (comprising the same three coalition parties, led by Smer-SD) on 22 March. Nevertheless, further large protests were held to demand elections. On 1 March armed police detained several Italian nationals, but all were released from custody shortly afterwards, owing to lack of evidence. One of them, Antonino Vadalà, was rearrested on 13 March following the issuance of an international warrant by the Italian police on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering. (His extradition to Italy was approved in April.) After over 200 individuals were questioned, in September eight suspects were arrested, and on the following day five of them were charged with murder. In October it was announced that one of those arrested, Zoltán Andruskó, had agreed to co-operate with the authorities and had named the individual who had ordered the killing. </p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P28">In December 2019 Andruskó was sentenced to 15 years in prison, after pleading guilty to all charges against him and agreeing to provide testimony for the prosecution in the trials of the other defendants. The trial of the four other accused, Marián Kočner, Alena Zsuzsová, Tomáš Szabó and Miroslav Marček, began in January 2020. Investigators found evidence suggesting that Kočner had bribed judges and had access to high-level police files; he had previously been arrested in June 2018, on charges of tax fraud and forgery. Marček confessed to killing Kuciak and his fiancée, and Andruskó testified against all four defendants. In February 2020 Kočner was sentenced to 19 years’ imprisonment in relation to the forgery charges; however, after an appeal, he was retried and acquitted in mid-2023. In April Marček was sentenced to 23 years in prison, and Szabó received a similar sentence.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P29">Public outrage at the murders led to widespread dissatisfaction with the political establishment, reflected in the results of local government elections in November 2018. Voter participation rose to 48.7%. Independent candidates received 42.4% of the votes cast in mayoral elections, and 34.5% of the vote for local councillors. Smer-SD failed to secure the mayoralty or control of councils in any major city, while independents won control of several, including Žilina and Banská Bystrica.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P30">The presidential election in March 2019 was won by a political newcomer, Zuzana Čaputová, who had gained prominence while working as an environmental campaigner. Čaputová had joined a recently formed political party, Progresívne Slovensko (PS—Progressive Slovakia), in 2017 and was its candidate in the presidential election. In the first round, she secured 40.6% of the votes cast. The Smer-SD candidate, Maroš Šefčovič, won just 18.7%. In the run-off poll, Čaputová gained 58.4% of the votes, after campaigning on a pro-EU and liberal-democratic platform.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P31">Elections to the European Parliament in May 2019 foreshadowed a shift in the political composition of Slovakia’s National Council. A coalition of PS and another relatively new party, SPOLU—Občianska Demokracia (TOGETHER—Civic Democracy), won 20.1% of the votes cast and obtained four of Slovakia’s 14 seats. Smer-SD obtained 15.7% of the vote and three seats, the ĽSNS 12.1% and two seats, the KDH 9.7% and two seats (to be reduced to one following a subsequent reorganization of the Parliament), SaS 9.6% and two seats, and a coalition of OĽaNO and NOVA 5.3% and one seat. Although the share of the Slovakian electorate who voted was just 22.7%, this was the highest recorded rate of participation for European Parliament elections in Slovakia, although it again represented the lowest turnout in any EU country.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P32">The arrests and trials fuelled concerns about what opposition politicians called a `mafia state’. In the elections to the National Council held on 29 February 2020, Smer-SD received just 18.3% of the votes cast and 38 seats, while the SNS and Most/Híd failed to meet the 5% threshold for parliamentary representation. Neither ethnic Hungarian party secured representation, although together they received nearly 6.0% of the votes cast. Reformist parties won an overwhelming share of the vote and seats in the National Council. The first-placed party, OĽaNO, received 25.0% of the votes and 53 seats, a gain of 34 seats compared with the previous elections. PS and SPOLU—Občianska Demokracia again contested the elections in alliance, but obtained only 6.96% of the votes, just under the 7% threshold required for coalitions to enter parliament. Consequently, only 73% of the vote went to parties with parliamentary representation, resulting in the increase of three seats (to 17) for the ĽSNS, although its vote share remained unchanged, at 8.0%. The President invited Igor Matovič, the leader of OĽaNO, to form a new government. His coalition Government, which took office on 21 March, comprised four parties: OĽaNO, the SaS, Sme Rodina and Za Ľudí (For the People), which had been established by former President Kiska. The new coalition held 95 seats, and was also supported by some deputies who had declared themselves independent of any political party after the elections.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P33">The 2019 presidential election and the 2020 parliamentary elections signalled a new phase in Slovakian politics, with the accession to power of those who had reached adulthood after the collapse of communist rule. Čaputová’s election to the presidency and OĽaNO’s election to government reflected this transformation. The 2014 and 2019 presidential elections and the 2020 parliamentary elections indicated that voters prefer power not to be concentrated in any one party. Smer-SD’s loss of votes at the 2020 elections led to a split in the party. In June, after Pellegrini was refused permission to contest the leadership of Smer-SD, he founded a new political party, the Hlas—Sociálna Demokracia (Voice—Social Democracy), to attract disenchanted supporters of Smer-SD. He was joined by 10 former members of Smer-SD, leaving the party with just 15 parliamentary deputies.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P34">Although electoral democracy in Slovakia is strong, intra-party democracy is weak. Most parties are formed around one charismatic leader, and find it difficult to accommodate change from within, with the result that dissident members secede and form their own parties. The ideological differences among parties are often ill-defined. Consequently, unstable coalitions frequently ensue, and many parties lack both a stable electoral base and a strong party organization. </p>

          <heading>The COVID-19 Crisis and the War in Ukraine</heading>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P35">By mid-2020 Slovakia appeared to have responded quickly and effectively to the COVID-19 pandemic that emerged in Europe in February. Initially, COVID-19 infection and death rates in the country were among the lowest in Europe. Even before the Government took action, there was widespread consensus about the benefits of using face masks and other preventative measures. Television broadcasters, politicians and the general public started to use face masks. Car manufacturers halted operations, owing to a drop in demand, in effect preventing workplace transmission. From 28 February the Government introduced temperature-screening for all those arriving in Slovakia by air. The first confirmed case, associated with a citizen returning from Italy, was recorded on 6 March. On 8 March secondary schools in the Bratislava region were closed, followed by primary schools in Bratislava city and secondary schools in the Trnava and Košice regions on the following day. On 10 March all public events were suspended, and two days later all event venues were closed. From 13 March travellers returning from abroad were required to self-isolate for two weeks, border controls were reinstated, and international passenger transport was halted. Notably, a convoy of skiers returning from Austria were stopped by police, tested, and placed in isolation for two weeks; 60 of them tested positive. From 15 March face masks were required for those using public transport and in shops. On the following day all non-essential shops were closed. By 26 March the wearing of face masks in public had been made compulsory.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P36">When the Matovič Government took office on 21 March 2020, it introduced additional measures to slow the spread of the pandemic. Between 8 and 14 April free movement was banned, except for essential shopping and business activities. By the end of April the daily rate of increase in cases had fallen to 0.5% or less, and on 22 April the Government began to relax the restrictions on movement and social interaction, including reopening markets.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P37">Initially, cases were concentrated in Bratislava city, but they gradually spread throughout the country along the main east-west transportation routes. In what some considered a contentious move, the Government identified 260 areas, including some 260,000 residents who were considered at high risk of infection, owing to poverty or overcrowding, singling them out for testing. On 3 April 2020 the Government began to test extensively for the virus among the Roma community, and on 8 April it quarantined several Roma settlements in eastern Slovakia, where over 30 cases were found.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P38">The wide-ranging measures appeared to arrest the spread of the virus, reducing COVID-19 cases to manageable levels. From 6 May 2020 hotel and taxi services were allowed to resume, and church and wedding services were permitted. Outdoor restaurants were allowed to reopen, as were museums, art galleries and other outdoor tourist attractions. The final stage was the resumption of sporting events, and the reopening of shopping centres, theatres and cinemas. The closures in the manufacturing sector were ended even earlier. Kia Motors suspended production on 20 March and restarted it on 6 April; Volkswagen suspended operations on 17 March, and its plant in Bratislava reopened on 17 April. PSA, the parent company of Peugeot-Citroën, closed its factory in Slovakia on 19 March, resuming production there on 4 May. In the second half of 2020 the Government announced that all citizens aged 16 years and over would be tested for COVID-19 to allow the identification of infection hot-spots. However, from September case numbers and fatalities began to rise, in line with increases in the Czech Republic and Hungary. From 1 October the Government introduced new restrictions, including limiting the size of public gatherings and the number of customers in shops, closing indoor restaurants, cinemas, theatres, gyms and swimming pools and requiring people to wear face masks in public at all times. Travellers from outside the EU were required to self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival in Slovakia. By early 2021 the rates of infection and death from COVID-19 had become among the highest in Europe on a per-capita basis; the daily number of confirmed deaths rose to a high of around 100 in February. From April infections and deaths dropped progressively until mid-year, only to rise again in late 2021. Deaths reached a daily rate of 88 in mid-December, before steadily declining.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P39">The rise in COVID-19 infections undermined the Government’s credibility among the electorate. Relations among coalition member parties, already shaky, deteriorated further as the Government appeared to lose control of the crisis. They also reflected fundamental policy differences between Matovič and Richard Sulík, leader of SaS. A scandal over COVID-19 policies erupted in April 2021 when Matovič ordered 2m. doses of the Russian Federation’s state-developed Sputnik V vaccine, although it had not been approved by the EU’s European Medicines Agency (EMA) or the Slovakian authorities. After the first 200,000 doses were delivered, Slovakia’s national health watchdog announced that the composition of the vaccine differed from that being assessed by the EMA, and the Russian authorities consequently demanded the return of the vaccines. Meanwhile, in February, on the third anniversary of the murder of Kuciak, Matovič released a statement claiming that most Slovakian journalists were `superficial, biased, condescending and manipulative’, complaining that he had been `showered with hatred’ during his first 11 months in office.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P40">
      Public outrage prompted Matovič to resign on 1 April 2021. In a move denounced by some observers as inadequate, he was replaced as Prime Minister by another member of OĽaNO, Eduard Heger, and assumed the post of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance hitherto held by Heger. Neither the electorate nor other parties in the government coalition were convinced that this would lead to meaningful change. In Sept
      
      ember 2022 SaS finally withdrew from the coalition, and in December it caused the Government to lose a vote of confidence and collapse. Heger and his administration remained in office on an interim basis, and at the end of January 2023 new legislative elections were scheduled for 30 September. The long period between the collapse of the Government and the elections greatly increased political instability. In March 2023 Heger announced that he had left OĽaNO and formed a new party, Demokrati (Democrats). Many observers argued that the new party was OĽaNO in a different guise. Feuding continued among coalition parties, leading to the resignation of further ministers. On 7 May this forced Heger to resign and ask the President to appoint a new, technocratic Government. On 15 May a new interim Government was installed, under the premiership of Ľudovít Ódor, an independent and hitherto the Deputy Governor of the central bank. Ódor was the first ethnic Hungarian to lead the country.

          <p>
      In addition to intra-governmental feuds during 2022-23, it was announced in early 2022 that Slovakia’s National Crime Agency had accused Fico of abusing his power while in government and of creating an `organized criminal group’ with some of his ministers, further undermining the standing of Smer-SD. Even after the Russian annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula in 2014, Slovak public opinion towards Russia remained ambivalent. Strong residual support for Russia was widespread, particularly among older people. However, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, public support turned against Russia. Slovakia declared its strong support for Ukraine, although Smer-SD continued to publicly support the Russian Government. By mid-2023 over 1m. refugees had passed through Slovakia, and over 100,000 had applied for temporary protection in the country. Slovakia donated Soviet-designed S-300 weapons and weapon systems to Ukraine, noting that the Ukrainian military relied on Soviet-era weapons systems and troops were familiar with them. It joined wide-ranging EU sanctions that were imposed against Russia, and engaged with NATO on improving preparedness for invasion or attack by Russia. In mid-March 2022 the Slovakian authorities announced the discovery of a Russian espionage network conducted by members of Russia’s diplomatic delegation in Bratislava, which had aimed to destabilize Slovakia’s political situation and subsidize websites that disseminated Russian propaganda. Several people were arrested, including a former Vice-Rector of a military academy. Evidence suggested that Russian-based donations had been received by Kotleba’s ĽSNS and other far-right parties during the periods around the 2016 and 2020 elections. These parties supported closer ties with Russia and were opposed to NATO and EU membership. Russia was also accused of supporting a news website, 
      <i>Hlavne Sprave</i>
       (Main News), which served as a vehicle for Russian propaganda. The Slovakian Government subsequently expelled 35 Russian diplomats from the country. Increases in the cost of energy and food restricted economic growth in 2022, when GDP rose by just 1.7%, with a similar rate expected in 2023. However, by mid-2023 Slovakia had diversified the sources of most of its energy supplies, and seemed well able to withstand any future energy shocks.

          <heading>Minority Rights</heading>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P41">Slovakia is a multi-ethnic state. Since the late 1990s efforts have been made to reduce discrimination against minority ethnic groups, particularly Roma, partly, prior to 2004, in order to meet the accession criteria of the EU. By the time of the 2021 census, ethnic Slovaks accounted for 83.8% of the population. Hungarians were the second largest ethnic group, accounting for 7.8% of the population, although their absolute number has fallen since 1991. Roma are the third largest group, accounting for 1.2% of the population, followed by Ruthenians and Ukrainians (0.6%). However, the definition of ethnicity is difficult. It can be based on mother tongue, language spoken at home, religion or self-identified nationality. Thus, at the 2011 census (conducted in several languages, including Slovak, Hungarian, Romany, Ruthenian and Ukrainian) some 3.1% of the population defined their mother tongue as Romany, and 9.4% defined it as Hungarian.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P42">Until 2010 Hungarian-speaking Slovakians were represented politically by the MKP. It formed part of the Government in 1998-2006, but suffered from internal dissension. In June 2009 a new party, Most/Hid, was created by former members of the MKP. It favoured Slovak-Hungarian co-operation, and a stronger emphasis on Roma concerns and social welfare. Most/Hid obtained legislative representation at the 2010, 2012 and 2016 elections, but the MKP failed to do so and reconstituted itself in 2012 as the Magyar Közösség Pártja (Party of the Hungarian Community). The MKP did win one seat in the elections to the European Parliament held in May 2014, but narrowly failed to retain representation in 2019. The continued existence of two Hungarian parties has divided the ethnic Hungarian vote, which accounts for about 10% of the electorate, leading to persistent under-representation in the legislature. In the 2020 legislative elections, neither party reached the 5% threshold, although their combined vote share amounted to almost 6%.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P43">Under the Mečiar Government, relations between Slovakia and Hungary were cool. Some Slovakians feared that Hungary, which had controlled parts of Slovakia in 1938-44 (and historically, with Bratislava, known as Pozsony in Hungarian, the capital of the Kingdom of Hungary in the 16th to 18th centuries), hoped to expand its borders. The prohibition from January 1996 of the official use of any language other than Slovak, the removal of bilingual road signs and the compulsory Slovak styling of female Hungarian surnames, despite an adverse ruling by the Slovakian Constitutional Court, were major sources of dispute.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P44">By 1999 the Dzurinda Government had adopted legislation allowing some ethnic Hungarians and other minorities to use their own language to communicate with local government organs. The law, drafted after extensive consultation with the EU and the OSCE, covered minority groups in areas where they comprised 20% or more of the population, thereby excluding some 158 Hungarian communities, with a population of about 100,000. A European Charter on minority languages entered into force on 1 January 2002, obliging Slovakia to provide better access to higher education for minorities. In 2004 a Hungarian-language university opened in Komárno. In 2016 a total of 585 schools in Slovakia used Hungarian as the main language of instruction, and almost 200 used both Slovak and Hungarian. Meanwhile, Ruthenian communities in eastern Slovakia gained language rights.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P45">Under Fico’s first premiership, amendments to the language law, from 2009, imposed additional constraints on the use of minority languages in public facilities. They could be used only at health care and social welfare facilities in towns and villages where at least 20% of the inhabitants were of that minority. The amendments also required simultaneous translations into Slovak of broadcasts in other languages, except Czech, on television and radio broadcasts, and permitted the use of Czech in communication with offices of the Slovakian Government.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P46">Roma social exclusion remains a persistent problem in Slovakia. Although poverty and inequality in Slovakia are low, 87% of the Roma community were at risk of poverty, compared with 13% for the general population. Average life expectancy at birth in Slovakia remains among the lowest in the OECD, due in large part to Roma social exclusion. Most of the country’s Roma population face low employment opportunities, widespread poverty and low life expectancy. In 2018 the average life span for Roma was six years less than the general population average, and the infant mortality rate almost three times the national average. Experts have argued that these differences are due to poor access to health care and poor housing conditions.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P47">Recent censuses are widely believed to have under-enumerated the Roma population. Estimates of their number range from 350,000 to 500,000, or almost 9% of the population. The Government has identified over 1,000 Roma settlements in the country, mainly in the east, where about 140,000 Roma are believed to live. Many of these settlements lack running water and electricity: nationally, 43% of Roma households lack bathroom facilities (compared with a national average of under 1%), and 25% have no running water. In some settlements, 90%, or even 100% of residents are reported to be unemployed, with many not having worked since 1989. In 2019 the OECD found that only 25% of the Roma population participated in the labour force. Voter participation rates are also low. Initiatives to encourage municipal authorities to build additional housing have not been well received. Some argue that such housing would simply reinforce patterns of Roma segregation. Many settlements are `squatter’ settlements, where the legal ownership of land is unclear, leaving residents vulnerable to eviction. The Roma population is characterized by relatively low levels of education. As part of the commitment to guarantee protection for minority languages, in early 2003 the Government announced plans to open three secondary schools with teaching in the Roma language; the first such school opened in Košice in September. In 2016 the Government committed to spending €30m. on education, particularly pre-school programmes, for Roma children, but access to education remains a particular source of concern. Lack of education exacerbates exclusion from the labour force and poverty. Access to pre-school education is limited. In 2019 the OECD estimated that although 77% of all children aged between four and six years were enrolled in primary or pre-primary education, the proportion of Roma children was only 34%. Only 58% of Roma 15-18-year-olds were enrolled in secondary education, compared with a national average of 91%, and only 6% of Roma 18-24-year-olds were enrolled in post-secondary education, compared with a national average of 50%.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P48">Since the late 1990s large numbers of Slovakian Roma have emigrated to the West. In 2001 a Roma man was beaten to death at a police station in eastern Slovakia. Seven of his police attackers were found guilty of torture in 2008. In 2003 it was alleged that Roma women from eastern Slovakia had been forced to undergo sterilization. Despite continued efforts at integration, in March 2003 the Czech Government announced that in the first 12 weeks of that year up to 20,000 Roma from Eastern Slovakia had migrated to the Czech Republic.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P49">EU membership in 2004 ameliorated the Roma’s situation in two ways: first, by outlawing discrimination on an ethnic basis; and second, by allowing free migration between member states. New legislation, which took effect from July, prohibited discrimination on the basis of sex, religion, faith, ethnicity, nationality, disability or sexual orientation. Consequently, the court system has become a powerful force in reducing discrimination. For example, in 2010 a Slovak civil rights lawyer filed a discrimination suit against an elementary school which was deemed to have violated anti-discrimination laws by separating students, rejecting arguments that the segregation was for academic reasons. Despite this, in late 2009 an eastern village built a wall to separate a Roma settlement from the rest of the village, arguing that the construction was intended to prevent theft. In 2010 the authorities in a western village of Plavecký razed a Roma settlement, claiming that it was illegal. During the 2010 election campaign, the SNS produced a controversial billboard advertisement depicting a bare-chested, apparently Roma man, featuring the slogan `We should not feed those who do not want to work’.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P50">In June 2013 police raided an isolated Roma settlement in eastern Slovakia, purportedly in search of seven criminals or suspects. The police claimed that they had been met fierce resistance, but Slovakia’s ombudsman found evidence of unlawful detention, illegal entries into homes, the violation of fundamental human rights, and no evidence that Roma citizens had attacked police. The Ministry of the Interior insisted that the conduct of the police had been justified, although it was condemned by several international organizations, including the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Also in 2012, a Slovak court ruled that a school discriminated against Roma children by placing them in separate classrooms. In April 2015 the EU initiated proceedings against Slovakia for violating anti-discrimination statutes, and in 2017 a report by human rights organization Amnesty International stated that Roma children still suffered from segregation, being frequently placed in separate classrooms or in programmes for disabled children. However, ending discrimination is a complex issue. A programme to create schools within isolated Roma settlements was denounced by Amnesty International as perpetuating segregation, whereas policymakers had viewed it as a means of ensuring access to education. Unlike the ethnic Hungarian population of Slovakia, the Roma community has no significant political parties, and lacks representation in government, although the establishment of Most/Híd represented an attempt to overcome this. Discrimination and violence remain widespread. None the less, the first Roma parliamentary deputy was elected in 2012, and there are examples of successful integration, such as in the eastern municipality of Spišský Hrhov.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P51">Same-sex sexual activity was legalized in 1962, and the age of consent was lowered from 18 to 15 years in 1990—the same age as for heterosexual activity. Slovakia also has comprehensive laws banning discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and identity in employment, the provision of goods and services, education, and health services. Hate crimes and hate speech are also forbidden. Gay and bisexual people are allowed to serve openly in the armed forces. In 2007 a poll indicated that two-thirds of Slovakians believed that homosexuality should be accepted by society. Same-sex partnerships are not available in Slovakia, but recent opinion polls suggest that most Slovaks accept civil partnerships, and a significant minority support the idea of same-sex marriage. However, in June 2014 parliament overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment reaffirming marriage as a heterosexual institution. In 2018 SaS unsuccessfully proposed legislation to legalize civil unions. Despite this, since 2018 Slovakia’s civil and criminal law has recognized what is termed a `close person’, a sibling, spouse, family member or person in a relationship where `if an injury suffered by one of them is reasonably felt by the other person as an injury suffered by him or her’. This particularly applies to inheritance, while providing only limited rights in other areas. In 2018 the Government also complied with a ruling of the European Court of Justice stating that EU member states must give full residency rights to all married couples or couples in a civil union if at least one partner is an EU citizen.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P52">Slovakia has freedom of religion, and members of all religions are free to worship. There are 18 officially registered religious groups, which are entitled to receive state aid for schools and salaries. Until 2017 a religious group was required to have 20,000 or more adherents to qualify for state aid. In November 2016, at the initiative of the SNS, the legislature approved a law raising the required number of adherents to 50,000. President Kiska vetoed the law, denouncing it as discriminatory and an infringement of fundamental human rights, but the legislature overruled the veto in January 2017, and the law entered into force in March. It was widely believed to be aimed at ensuring that Islamic groups would not be able to receive state aid in the future; at that time, there were an estimated 5,000 Muslims living in Slovakia. The issue of refugees and other immigrants from the Middle East has become a political debating point in the country since the outbreak of civil war in the Syrian Arab Republic. Former Prime Minister Fico insisted that Slovakia would not accept Muslim refugees, and in elections in 2016 he campaigned on this point under the slogan `Protect Slovakia’. Meanwhile, the number of foreign nationals working in Slovakia increased five-fold between 2001 and 2019, reaching about 2% of the labour force, and it has been estimated that about 120,000 foreign nationals now reside in the country, over one-half of whom originate from outside the EU.</p>

          <heading>Foreign Policy</heading>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P53">Until 1998 Slovakia’s governments were criticized for their lack of commitment to democratic reform and civil rights. The Dzurinda Government, which took office in October of that year, was, however, outspoken in its enthusiasm for Western and European institutions. Slovakia was invited, in December 1999, to begin accession negotiations with the EU. In July 2000 Slovakia was invited to join the OECD, and became a full member in December. Slovakia received invitations to join NATO and the EU in late 2002, and joined both organizations in 2004. Slovakia entered the Schengen Agreement on open borders within Europe in December 2007, and joined the eurozone in January 2009. NATO membership appeared to have paid dividends when the USA implemented a visa-free regime for Slovakian citizens from October 2008.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P54">The Dzurinda Government ended disagreements with the Czech Republic that had persisted since the dissolution of the Czech and Slovak Federation in 1993. In 2004 the two countries settled their last remaining financial disputes over the former federation’s assets, cancelling mutual financial claims, to the benefit of Slovakia. In 2007 the two countries agreed to divide the archives of the former Czechoslovakian military, which had remained in Czech state possession, and which contained the files of the communist-era military intelligence service.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P55">Relations with Hungary also improved. As well as new minority-language legislation, a decision was agreed in September 1999 to build a new bridge across the Danube, linking Štúrovo in Slovakia with the Hungarian city of Esztergom, replacing one destroyed at the end of the Second World War.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P56">The inclusion of the SNS in the Government in 2006, and nationalist rhetoric on the part of Fico and SNS leader Slota, again raised tensions between Hungary and Slovakia, particularly given that Slota suggested Hungary held territorial ambitions with regard to Slovakia. In May 2010 the Hungarian legislature adopted legislation permitting ethnic Hungarians outside Hungary to apply for Hungarian citizenship, raising fears that, by offering citizenship to ethnic Hungarians in Slovakia, Hungary could practise annexation by stealth. Later on that day, the Slovak parliament voted to amend the country’s citizenship law, providing for the removal of Slovak citizenship from those who applied for citizenship of a second country. After the change of power in Slovakia in 2010, relations with Hungary again improved. In January 2011 the Hungarian Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, made the first official visit by a Hungarian premier to Slovakia in 12 years, meeting his Slovak counterpart.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P57">In 2007 tensions developed between Slovakia and Austria, after the Government and the electricity generating enterprise Slovenské Elektrárne announced plans to build a further two nuclear power reactors at the Mochovce nuclear power plant near the Austrian border, despite Austrian dissatisfaction. Prime Minister Fico argued that the use of nuclear power was necessary as a means of reducing Slovakian dependence on imported energy, particularly from Russia, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Slovakia also agreed to import electricity from Ukraine.</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P58">Slovakia enjoys good relations with NATO and with other EU member states. Slovakia strongly opposed relaxing the conditions for the 2009 Greek bailout, despite the subsequent collapse of the Greek economy. Such an attitude is perhaps understandable, given the austerity measures Slovakia had to implement in order to enter the eurozone in 2009. In this respect, the Slovakian perspective resembles that of other former communist states that have since joined the eurozone, including Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovenia. In common with several other countries in the region, Slovakia has also strongly resisted calls by the EU to accept refugees and other immigrants from the Middle East. In May 2017 Prime Minister Fico announced that `Islam has no place in Slovakia’. Within the EU, Slovakia has strongly supported a stronger stance on the rule of law, supported the imposition of sanctions against Russia and supported making payments of funds from the EU’s recovery plan for Europe conditional on respect for the rule of law (with particular implications for Hungary and Poland).</p>
          <p id="SLOVAKIA.HISTORY.ED.DF.P59">Until Russia’s invasion of Ukraine Slovakia enjoyed good relations with Russia, but tensions frequently arose. The Slovakian Government released a statement emphasizing its respect for the integrity of international borders after the Russian-Georgian war of August 2008. In May 2010, when Hungary passed a law permitting ethnic Hungarians outside Hungary to apply for Hungarian citizenship, some Slovak commentators compared the measure to Russia’s granting of citizenship to residents of the separatist Georgian territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, as a prelude to annexation. Slovakia sided with Russia in its refusal to recognize Kosovo’s independence from Serbia in 2008, but mainly owing to perceived analogies between Kosovo and Slovakia’s predominantly ethnically Hungarian regions. In 2014, for similar reasons, Slovakia opposed Russia’s annexation of Crimea. After Russia suspended gas supplies to Slovakia (and other countries in Central and South-Eastern Europe) in early 2009, during a price dispute between Russia and Ukraine, the Slovakian authorities started to diversify their sources of energy supply. Slovakia subsequently established gas connections with four other countries—Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland and Austria. In 2014, following the Russian annexation of Crimea, the Slovakian Government agreed to transport limited amounts of gas (principally originating from Russia) to Ukraine through its domestic pipeline system. By mid-2015 gas deliveries via Slovakia accounted for about one-third of Ukrainian consumption. In response, Russia reduced shipments of gas to Slovakia by 50%. Meanwhile, Slovakia opposed the imposition of further sector-specific sanctions on Russia by the EU, arguing that diplomacy would be more effective, while supporting the sanctions already imposed. The Ministry of Defence announced plans to replace all of the country’s Soviet-era weaponry and military equipment with Western-made products, starting in 2015 with the purchase of new military helicopters. In 2016 President Kiska criticized what he termed Russia’s policies of disinformation. In August 2020 the Slovakian Government expressed its support for pro-democracy demonstrators in Belarus protesting against what were widely viewed as flawed elections held in that month, in which the long-serving, authoritarian leader, Alyaksandr Lukashenka, was re-elected as President. In early 2021 , a dispute broke out between Slovakia and Russia over a shipment of Russian-manufactured COVID-19 vaccine doses, which Slovakia claimed differed from the original specifications. The Russian authorities described the Slovakian complaint as `false news’ and demanded that the vaccines be returned.</p>

      The Slovakian Government has strongly opposed the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, and provided weapons and emergency aid to Ukraine (see 
      <i>The COVID-19 Crisis and the War in Ukraine</i>
      ). President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine was invited to address Slovakia’s National Council via video link in May. The invasion has also had an impact on the Slovakian political scene. Smer-SD and the ĽSNS have continued to object to the wide-ranging EU sanctions that were imposed against Russia following its invasion and progressively strengthened, thereby undermining their electoral support. Despite the considerable cost to the Slovakian economy and citizens resulting from the sanctions against Russia, however, other parties and public opinion have turned against Russia.
