               <p id="SK.IS.3">The Slovak Republic (formerly a constituent republic of the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic, or Czechoslovakia) is a landlocked state located in Central Europe, bordered to the north by Poland, to the east by Ukraine, to the south by Hungary, to the west by Austria and to the north-west by the Czech Republic (Czechia). The climate is typically continental, with cold, dry winters and hot, humid summers. Average temperatures in Bratislava range from −0.7°C (30.7°F) in January to 21.1°C (70.0°F) in July. Average annual rainfall in the capital is 649&#160;mm (26 ins). The official language is Slovak, although Hungarian, Czech and other languages are also spoken. The major religion is Christianity, the Latin rite Catholic Church being the largest denomination, followed by the Evangelical Church of the Augsburg (Lutheran) Confession. The national flag (proportions 2 by 3) consists of three equal horizontal stripes, of white, blue and red; in the centre hoist there is a white-rimmed red shield containing a silver archiepiscopal (double-barred) cross surmounted on the central (and highest) of three blue hillocks. The capital is Bratislava.</p>

                    <heading>Historical Context</heading>
                    <p id="SK.IS.6">A movement of nationalist revival evolved in Slovakia in the late 18th and 19th centuries. The Republic of Czechoslovakia was established on 28 October 1918, as one of the successor states to the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The country’s boundaries were defined by the Treaty of Trianon of 1920, under which a large Hungarian minority was incorporated into Slovakia. Czechoslovakia’s first Constitution, promulgated in 1920, made no provision for a proper federal system, and Slovak proposals for self-government were rejected by the central authorities in the capital, Prague.</p>
                    <p id="SK.IS.7">In October 1938, following the Munich Agreement of 29 September (whereby the predominantly German-populated areas of Czechoslovakia were ceded to Germany), nationalists declared Slovak auto­nomy. On 14 March 1939, one day before Nazi armed forces occupied the Czech Lands, Germany agreed to the establishment of a separate Slovak state, under the pro-Nazi puppet’ regime of Fr Jozef Tiso.</p>
                    <p id="SK.IS.8">Following the restoration of the Czechoslovak state in 1945, at the end of the Second World War, certain concessions were made to Slovak demands for autonomy, including the establishment of a regional legislature with restricted powers (the Slovenská Národná Rada—Slovak National Council) and an executive, both in Brati­slava, the Slovak capital. However, communists (led by Gustav Husák) seized power in Slovakia in late 1947, and in the whole of the country in 1948. In June Klement Gottwald, leader of the Komunistická Strana Československa (KSČ—Communist Party of Czechoslovakia) and Prime Minister since 1946, became President of Czechoslovakia.</p>
                    <p id="SK.IS.9">In the first years of communist rule expressions of Slovak nationalism were suppressed, and in 1954 Husák and other Slovaks were imprisoned on charges of separatism. The 1960 Constitution restricted Slovak autonomy: the executive in Bratislava was dissolved, and legislative authority was removed from the Slovak National Council. In January 1968 Alexander Dubček, a Slovak and leader of the Komunistická Strana Slovenska (KSS—Communist Party of Slovakia) was appointed First Secretary of the KSČ. The wide-ranging political and economic reforms introduced by Dubček and the new Government included plans for the creation of a federal system of two equal republics. Following the armed intervention of some 600,000 troops of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and its allies in August, Dubček was replaced by Husák as First (subsequently General) Secretary of the KSČ, and there was a purge of party members, in particular reformists and associates of Dubček. Nevertheless, the federal system was realized in Janu­ary 1969: separate Czech and Slovak Socialist Republics were established, each with its own government and legislature (Národná Rada—National Council). Supreme legislative and executive power, meanwhile, were vested in the Federal Assembly and the Federal Government, respectively. However, renewed centralized rule, under Husák's leadership, left the new regional institutions largely powerless. In 1975 Husák was appointed President of Czechoslovakia. In 1987 he was replaced as General Secretary of the KSČ by Miloš Jakeš. The Government continued its repressive treatment of both the Catholic Church and the several dissident groups that had been established since the late 1970s (the most important being Charta 77—Charter 77). Nevertheless, the dissi­dent movement organized a series of anti-Government demonstrations, beginning in 1988, which culminated in the anti-communist revolution of late 1989.</p>
                    <p id="SK.IS.12">Elections to the Federal Assembly and to the Czech and Slovak National Councils on 8-9 June 1990 were the first to be held freely since 1946. Of the Slovak organizations, Verejnosť Proti Násiliu (VPN—Public Against Violence), which had been a principal force in effecting the end of communist rule, emerged with the largest representation at both federal and republican level. A coalition Slovak Government, dominated by VPN, was subsequently formed, with Vladimír Mečiar as Prime Minister.</p>

                    <heading>Domestic Political Affairs</heading>
                    <p>The future of Czech-Slovak relations dominated political debate in the latter half of 1990. The Kresťanskodemokratické Hnutie (KDH—Christian Democratic Movement), which formed part of the Slovak coalition Government, advocated greater Slovak autonomy within a common state; however, more radical parties—most notably the Slovenská Národná Strana (SNS—Slovak National Party), which held seats in both the federal and republican legislatures—favoured the complete secession of Slovakia. In March 1991 Mečiar was forced to resign as Slovak Prime Minister, following his support for full auto­nomy for Slovakia. Mečiar left VPN and formed the Hnutie za Demokratické Slovensko (HZDS—Movement for a Democratic Slovakia), being replaced as Prime Minister by Ján Čarnogurský, the leader of the KDH.</p>
                    <p>Following elections to the federal and republican legislatures on 5-6 June 1992, the HZDS was the largest Slovak party both in the Federal Assembly and the National Council. In the latter body the HZDS won 74 of the 150 seats available, compared with the 18 obtained by the KDH and 15 by the SNS. The Strana Demokratickej Ľavice (SDĽ—Party of the Democratic Left—the successor to the KSS) secured the second largest representation (29 seats). Mečiar was reinstated as Prime Minister, heading a new, HZDS-dominated Slovak Government.</p>
                    <p>On 17 July 1992 the Slovak National Council approved a declaration of Slovak sovereignty, and later in the month Mečiar and his Czech counterpart, Václav Klaus, reached agreement on the neces­sary measures to permit the separation of the two republics. On 1 September a new Slovak Constitution was adopted by the Slovak National Council. In November the Federal Assembly approved (at the third attempt) legislation to permit the constitutional dissolution of Czechoslovakia, which was to take effect on 1 January 1993. During late 1992 the division of federal assets and liabilities, as well as the armed forces, between the Czech and Slovak Republics accelerated. The two republics signed a co-operation agreement, and subsequently established formal diplomatic relations. International recognition was rapidly accorded to the new states.</p>

                         <heading>After Independence</heading>
                         <p id="SK.IS.17">Slovakia’s HZDS-dominated Government and legislature remained in place. In February 1993 the Národná Rada Slovenskej Republiky (National Council of the Slovak Republic, as the legislature was redesignated) elected Michal Kováč, Deputy Chairman of the HZDS and former Chairman of Czechoslovakia’s Federal Assem­bly, as President. Internal divisions in the HZDS culminated in March with the dismissal of Milan Kňažko, the strongest critic of Mečiar within the party, as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs. Also in March the SNS leader, Ľudovít Černák, resigned as Minister of the Economy, leaving the Government composed almost exclusively of members of the HZDS, which, as a result of several defections, lost its majority in the legislature. A new coalition Government, in which the SNS held several principal portfolios, was formed in November. In February 1994 the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Jozef Moravčík, and the Deputy Prime Minister, Roman Kováč, resigned from the Government, subsequently establishing the Demokratická Únia Slovenska (DEÚS—Democratic Union of Slovakia). In March the National Council approved a motion expressing no confidence in Mečiar’s Government, prompting its resignation. A new, interim coalition was installed, led by Moravčík. Early legislative elections were scheduled for September.</p>
                         <p id="SK.IS.19">At elections to the National Council, held on 30 September and 1 October 1994, an HZDS-led alliance was first-placed, securing 35.0% of the votes cast and 61 seats. A left-wing alliance led by the SDĽ won 10.4% of the votes and 18 seats, followed by a coalition of Hungarian parties, and the KDH, with 17 seats each. The DEÚS took 15 seats, the Združenie Robotníkov Slovenska (ZRS—Union of Workers of Slovakia) 13 and the SNS nine. Mečiar established a coalition administration of the HZDS, the SNS and the ZRS in December.</p>
                         <p id="SK.IS.23">Following opposition demands for a referendum to be held on their proposal that the head of state be elected by direct popular vote President Kováč scheduled a referendum for 23-24 May 1997. However, when the poll took place, the question on presidential elections was omitted and the majority of voters boycotted the referendum, rendering it invalid. The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Pavol Hamžík, resigned in protest. In June thousands rallied in protest against the Government’s intervention in the referendum. In February 1998, following a Constitutional Court ruling, Kováč announced a new referendum for April. During January-March 1998 attempts to elect a new President failed in the National Council. On 2 March Kováč’s term expired, and certain presidential powers were transferred to the Government. Mečiar cancelled the referendum scheduled for April, granted amnesties to prisoners, and halted criminal proceedings relating to the May 1997 referendum. The A series of protest rallies was organized by opposition parties.</p>
                         <p id="SK.IS.29">
            In May 1998 the National Council approved legislation that restricted pre-election campaigning to the state-run media. Elections to the National Council were held on 25-26 September, with the participation of 84.2% of the electorate. The HZDS remained the strongest party, winning 43 seats (with 27.0% of the votes cast), but was unable to form a government, with its only possible ally, the SNS, holding 14 seats. The Slovenská Demokratická Koalícia (SDK—Slovak Democratic Coalition) obtained 42 seats (26.3% of the votes), the SDĽ 23 seats (14.7%), the ethnic Hungarian Magyar Koalíció Pártja (MKP—Party of the Hungarian Coalition) 15 seats and the newly formed Strana Občianskeho Porozumenia (SOP—Party of Civic Understanding) 13 seats. With a combined total of 93 seats, the SDK, the SDĽ, the MKP and the SOP agreed to form a new administration, and a coalition Government headed by Mikuláš Dzurinda, the leader of the SDK, was appointed at the end of October. Dzurinda emphasized the new Government’s intention to pursue membership of the

             and the

            .
          </p>
                         <p>In January 1999 the National Council approved a constitutional amendment providing for the introduction of direct presidential elections. The ruling coalition nominated Rudolf Schuster, the Chairman of the SOP, as its presidential candidate. In the first round of the presidential election on 15 May Schuster won 47.4% of the votes cast, and Mečiar obtained 37.2%. Schuster defeated Mečiar in a second round of voting on 29 May, with 57.2% of the votes, and was inaugurated as President on 15 June.</p>
                         <p>In October 1999, after a large demonstration was staged in Bratislava to protest against declining living standards, Černák resigned as Minister of the Economy, and was succeeded by Ľubomír Harach, the Chairman of the DEÚS. In February 2000 Dzurinda established a new party, the Slovenská Demokratická a Kresťanská Únia (SDKÚ—Slovak Democratic and Christian Union), which several government ministers joined.</p>
                         <p>Revisions to the Constitution entered into effect in July, which strengthened the powers of the Constitutional Court and granted greater independence to the judi­ciary. In May Schuster replaced Pavol Hamzik, the Deputy Prime Minister for European Integration, who was held responsible for the suspension of EU payments in the previous month, following the misuse of funds. Also in May the Minister of the Interior tendered his resignation. In January 2002 the Minister of Finance, Brigita Schmögnerová of the SDĽ, resigned. Schmögnerová subsequently left the SDĽ and formed a new political party, the Sociálnodemokratická Alternatíva (SDA—Social Democratic Alternative).</p>
                         <p>In July 2002 members of the HZDS who had not been selected by the party to contest forthcoming legislative elections established a new party, the Hnutie za Demokraciu (HD—Movement for Democracy). At the elections to the National Council, held on 20-21 September, the HZDS was first-placed, obtaining 19.5% of the votes cast and 36 mandates. The SDKÚ received 15.1% of the votes and 28 seats, the centre-right Smer (Direction) 13.5% and 25 seats, the MKP 11.2% and 20 seats, the KDH 8.3% and 15 seats, the Aliancia Nového Občana (ANO—New Citizens’ Alliance) 8.0% and 15 seats, and the KSS 6.3% and 11 seats. Mečiar proved unable to form a coalition government, and consequently Schuster invited Dzurinda to establish a new administration. A coalition agreement was signed in early October by four centre-right parties (the SDKÚ, the MKP, the KDH and the ANO), which together held 78 of the 150 seats in the National Council. On 16 October Schuster formally appointed a coalition Government. The leader of the Demokratická Strana (DS—Democratic Party), which had supported the SDKÚ in the elections, was also allocated a portfolio.</p>

                         <p>At a national referendum, conducted on 16-17 May 2003, 92.5% of votes were cast in favour of Slovakia’s membership of the EU; some 52% of the electorate participated in the ballot. The country became a full member of the EU on 1 May 2004.</p>
                         <p>Meanwhile, in June 2003 Mečiar was re-elected as Chairman of the HZDS, which was renamed Ľudová Strana-Hnutie za Demokratické Slovensko (ĽS-HZDS, People’s Party-Movement for a Democratic Slovakia). Tensions emerged within the ruling coalition in July, after the National Council approved legislative amendments, proposed by the ANO, easing restrictions on abortion, which were strongly opposed by the KDH. In late July Schuster vetoed the legislation, fearing the collapse of the Government. In September the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Economy, Robert Nemcsics, resigned, following his criticism of Pavel Rusko, the ANO Chairman; Rusko replaced him later that month. In October Juraj Liska was appointed as Minister of Defence, replacing Ivan Šimko. A number of deputies subsequently left the SDKÚ to join Šimko’s newly formed Slobodné Fórum (Free Forum), rendering the ruling coalition a minority Government.</p>
                         <p id="SK.IS.2004041577665">In the first round of voting in the presidential election of 3 April 2004, Mečiar won 32.7% of the votes cast, followed by HD leader Ivan Gašparovič, with 22.3% of the votes. Minister of Foreign Affairs Eduard Kukan of the SDKÚ took third place, with 22.1% of the votes, while Schuster, the incumbent, obtained just 7.4% of the votes. In the second round of voting, held on 17 April, Gašparovič was elected as President, receiving 59.9% of the votes cast (with a rate of participation by the electorate of 43.5%). Gašparovič, who subsequently resigned the leadership of the HD, was inaugurated on 15 June. At the country’s first elections to the Euro­pean Parliament, held in June 2004, the rate of participation by the electorate, at 17.0%, was the lowest recorded of any EU member state. The SDKÚ, the ĽS-HZDS, Smer and the KDH each received three seats, while the MKP obtained two.</p>
                         <p id="SK.IS.2005041412">In January 2005 a new party, Smer-Sociálna Demokracia (Smer-SD, Direction-Social Democracy), was formed by the merger of Smer, the Sociálnodemokratická Strana Slovenska (Social Democratic Party of Slovakia), the SDA and the SDĽ. In August Gašparovič dismissed Rusko from the Government, after he was implicated in a loan scandal. Members of the ANO opposed to Rusko’s leadership of the party, including two party Vice-Chairmen, Ľubomír Lintner and Jirko Malchárek, and Tóth, formed a breakaway faction, led by Lintner. In early September the SDKÚ, the KDH and the MKP agreed to expel the ANO from the ruling coalition. Lintner’s group of deputies pledged co-operation with the governing parties, and in October Malchárek became Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Economy. In the same month DS leader Ľudovít Kaník resigned as Minister of Labour, Social Affairs and the Family. Kaník, who was replaced by Iveta Radičová, subsequently announced a merger of the DS and the SDKÚ.</p>
                         <p>In January 2006 the Minister of Defence, Juraj Liška, tendered his resignation, after a military aircraft crashed on the Hungarian-Slovak border, killing some 42 people. In February the KDH announced the withdrawal of its three ministers from the Government. The leader of the KDH subsequently resigned as Chairman of the National Council, and was replaced, in an acting capacity, by the MKP leader and Deputy Chairman of the legislature, Béla Bugár. As a result of the KDH’s withdrawal, the ruling coalition controlled just 53 seats in the legislature, and three days later the National Council approved a proposal by Dzurinda for legislative elections, originally due to take place in September, to be held in June.</p>
                         <p>In the legislative elections on 17 June 2006, 50 seats were won by Robert Fico’s Smer-SD, which secured 29.1% of the votes cast. The SDKÚ-DS obtained 18.4% of the votes (31 seats), while the SNS and the MKP both won 11.7% (20 seats). Fifteen seats were allocated to the ĽS-HZDS, which attracted 8.8% of the ballot, while the KDH secured 14 seats, with 8.3%. The rate of participation was 54.7%. Three days later Fico was invited by President Gašparovič to form a government. Fico’s new coalition administration predominantly comprised members of Smer-SD, with the nationalist SNS and the ĽS-HZDS receiving three and two cabinet posts, respectively. Fico was formally appointed Prime Minister on 4 July. Smer-SD performed strongly at municipal elections on 2 December.</p>

                         <p>Seven candidates contested the first round of voting in a pres­idential election held on 21 March 2009. Gašparovič, with the support of Smer-SD and the SNS, secured 46.7% of the votes cast, followed by Radičová, a Vice-Chairman of the SDKÚ-DS, with 38.1%. Gašparovič defeated Radičová in a second round of voting on 4 April, receiving 55.5% of the votes cast. The rate of participation by the electorate was 43.6% in the first round and 51.7% in the second round. Gašparovič was inaugurated for a second presidential term on 15 June.</p>
                         <p>At elections to the National Council, which took place on 12 June 2010, Smer-SD obtained the greatest share of the votes cast (34.8%), securing 62 of the 150 legislative seats. The SDKÚ-DS was placed second, with 15.4% of the votes and 28 seats, followed by a newly established liberal party, Sloboda a Solidarita (SaS—Freedom and Solidarity), with 12.1% and 22 seats, the KDH, with 8.5% and 15 seats, Most/Híd (Bridge—created by former members of the MKP), with 8.1% and 14 seats, and the SNS, with 5.1% and nine seats. After Smer-SD proved unable to form a coalition with a parliamentary majority, President Gašparovič invited Radičová (the election leader of the SDKÚ-DS) to establish a coalition administration comprising the four centre-right parties in the National Council. On 8 July Fico and his Government resigned from office, and Radičová was appointed as Prime Minister (becoming the first woman to hold the post). A new Government, a coalition of the SDKÚ-DS, the KDH, Most/Híd and SaS, was subsequently installed; principal appointments included Ján Figeľ as First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Transport, Post and Telecommunications and Dzurinda as Minister of Foreign Affairs. On 10 August Radičová’s Government secured a vote of confidence in the National Council. However, from late 2010 trade unions organized a series of demonstrations, in protest against austerity measures planned by the Government to reduce the budget deficit.</p>
                         <p>On 11 October 2011 SaS boycotted a parliamentary vote on Slovakia’s endorsement of an expanded European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF—which had been established to support member countries of the eurozone suffering severe financial difficulties); the motion was consequently defeated in the National Council, causing the collapse of the coalition Government. After agreeing to a demand by Fico to schedule early elections for 10 March 2012, Radičová secured parliamentary approval of the EFSF, with the support of Smer-SD, in a second vote on 13 October 2011, subsequently announcing her intention to resign from the SDKÚ-DS. Meanwhile, a new political party, Obyčajní Ľudia a Nezávislé Osobnosti (OĽaNO—Ordinary People and Independent Personalities), led by Igor Matovič, a former member of SaS, was registered in October. In December a file purportedly compiled by the Slovak Information Service from 2005-06, which was published illicitly online, provided details of a system of bribes paid to senior officials of Dzurinda’s administration in order to secure contracts. Nationwide anti-corruption protests commenced in early 2012.</p>
                         <p>In the early elections to the National Council, held on 10 March 2012, Smer-SD obtained 83 seats, with 44.4% of the votes cast, winning an outright majority; the KDH received 16 seats (with 8.8% of the votes), ahead of OĽaNO, with 16 seats (8.6%), and Most/Híd, with 13 seats (6.9%). Both the SDKÚ-DS and SaS experienced a substantial decline in support, each receiving 11 seats. On 3 April President Gašparovič appointed Fico as Prime Minister; a Government that principally comprised members of Smer-SD was installed on the following day. In addition to several longstanding Smer-SD politicians, the new Government included three non-party members, among them diplomat Miroslav Lajčák, who again became Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>

                         <p> In December 2013 Fico announced his intention to contest the forthcoming presidential election. At the second round of the election on 29 March 2014, Andrej Kiska, a businessman without political affiliation, secured the presidency with 59.4% of the votes cast, defeating Fico (who had been the leading candidate in the first round on 15 March). Kiska was inaugurated as President on 15 June.</p>
                         <p>At elections to the European Parliament on 25 May 2014, Smer-SD secured four of the 13 seats allocated to Slovakia, the KDH two seats, the SDKÚ-DS two seats, and OĽaNO one seat. A conservative party founded in 2012, Nová Väčšina—Dohoda (NOVA, New Majority—Agreement), SaS, the MPK and Most/Híd each obtained one seat. The rate of participation was estimated at 13.0%, by far the lowest in any EU state.</p>
                         <p>Pavol Pavlis of Smer-SD was appointed as Minister of the Economy, as part of a government reorganization in July 2014. Allegations regarding an overpriced tender for medical equipment precipitated the resignations, in November, of the Minister of Health, and the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the National Council (all members of Smer-SD). In April 2015 Pavlis resigned over accusations of conflict of interest in the awarding of state contracts.</p>
                         <p>At legislative elections on 5 March 2016, Smer-SD received the highest number of seats in the National Council, with 49, and 28.3% of votes cast, but none the less lost its majority in the chamber. SaS took 21 seats and 12.1% of the votes, OĽaNO 19 seats (with 11.0% of the votes) and the SNS 15 seats (8.6%). The extremist, pro-Russian Kotleba—Ľudová Strana Naše Slovensko (ĽSNS, Kotleba—People’s Party Our Slovakia), led by Marian Kotleba, secured representation for the first time, with 14 seats and 8.0% of the votes, while a newly established, nationalist party, Sme Rodina (We are Family), obtained 11 seats (6.6%), Most/Híd 11 seats (6.5%), and a party formed by former KDH members, SIEŤ (Network), 10 seats (5.6%). A participation rate of 59.8% was recorded.</p>
                         <p>In mid-March 2016 Fico announced that a coalition agreement had been signed between Smer-SD, the SNS, SIEŤ and Most/Híd, causing several SIEŤ and Most/Híd deputies to leave their parties. On 23 March President Kiska approved Fico’s new coalition Government, in which eight of 14 ministerial posts were awarded to Smer-SD representatives, notably including former parliamentary Chairman Peter Pellegrini as Deputy Prime Minister, responsible for Investment.</p>
                         <p>In June 2016 opposition protests were staged in Bratislava to demand the resignation of both premier Fico and Minister of the Interior Robert Kaliňák, owing to Kaliňák’s business associations with real estate developer Ladislav Bašternák, who was under investigation for misappropriation of state funds and tax evasion. Fico continued to support Kaliňák, who refused to resign, and several parliamentary motions of no confidence against him were defeated. In mid-August five of the seven remaining SIEŤ deputies in the National Council left the party, owing to continued inter-party dissent, subsequently joining Most/Híd. The Minister of Transport, Construction and Regional Development, SIEŤ &#160;leader Roman Brecely, was consequently obliged to tender his resignation. After a modified coalition agreement was signed on 1 September, Most/Híd nominated Árpád Érsek to succeed Brecely as minister. A further large anti-corruption demonstration took place in Bratislava on 18 April 2017, and again on 5 June, when protesters demanded the resignations of Kaliňák and the head of police, Tibor Gašpar.</p>

                         <p>In late February 2018 it was reported that a journalist, Ján Kuciak, who had been investigating the activities in Slovakia of Italian businessmen with suspected links to an organized crime network, and alleged connections to senior state officials, had been shot dead, together with his fiancée Martina Kusnirová. The murders prompted an eruption of public outrage. Minister of Culture Marek Maďarič resigned at the end of February. On 2 March an estimated 20,000 people took part in a rally held in Bratislava in tribute to Kuciak, which was attended by President Kiska. The crisis intensified antagonism between Fico and Kiska, who urged the Prime Minister either to effect an extensive government reorganization or to announce early elections. Mass anti-Government demonstrations were held nationwide on 9 March. Kaliňák resigned on 12 March, following intensifying pressure. Finally, Fico announced his resignation on 15 March, and Kiska invited Deputy Prime Minister Pellegrini to form a new administration. Nevertheless, further large-scale protests to demand early elections took place on the following day. On 22 March Kiska appointed a reorganized Government headed by Pellegrini.</p>
                         <p>
            The new Government, comprising the same three coalition parties and retaining most of the previous ministers, secured a vote of confidence in the National Council on 27 March 2018, amid smaller demonstrations outside the parliamentary building. 
            <!--https://spectator.sme.sk/c/20786891/kiska-appoints-pellegrini-cabinet.html-->
            Richard Raši of Smer-SD, hitherto the Mayor of Košice, received Pellegrini’s former post of Deputy Prime Minister, responsible for Investment and Informatization, and Gábor Gál of Most/Híd became Minister of Justice. Two days later, Róbert Krajmer resigned as head of the National Anti-Corruption Police unit at the National Criminal Agency. However, further mass protests were organized on 5 April to demand Gašpar’s removal and an independent investigation into the murder of Kuciak. On 16 April the new Minister of the Interior, independent Tomáš Drucker, submitted his resignation in response to the continued unrest. Shortly afterwards, Pellegrini announced that Gašpar would resign at the end of May. Later in April President Kiska appointed Denisa Saková, a leading member of Smer-SD, as Minister of the Interior; protest leaders criticized the appointment. In mid-May Kiska announced his decision not to seek a second term at the next presidential election, with the stated aim of resolving political confrontation in the country. In September eight suspects were arrested in connection with the murders of Kuciak and his fiancée, and four were subsequently charged. In March 2019 a Slovakian businessman, Marián Kočner, with reported links to organized crime, was arrested and charged with ordering the murders. On 6 April 2020 a former soldier was sentenced to 23 years’ imprisonment, after pleading guilty to the murders. On 3 September Kočner (who in February had received a 19-year prison sentence on separate corruption charges) was acquitted of ordering the murders. After the Supreme Court ordered a retrial, in May 2023 Kočner was again acquitted, but an associate, Alena Zsuzsová, was sentenced to 25 years’ imprisonment.

                         <p>Meanwhile, a number of presidential candidates emerged, including ĽSNS leader Kotleba, and a prominent environmental activist, Zuzana Čaputová, who had been selected to represent a newly established party, Progresívne Slovensko (PS—Progressive Slovakia). In January 2019 Smer-SD announced its support for an independent candidate, Maroš Šefčovič. At the first round of the presidential election, which was contested by a total of 15 candidates on 15 March, Čaputová received 40.6% of votes cast, Šefčovič 18.7%, an independent candidate and former minister, Štefan Harabin, 14.3% and Kotleba 10.4%. Čaputová and Šefčovič proceeded to a second round on 30 March, at which Čaputová secured victory, with 58.4% of the votes. The official voter turnout was 48.7% in the first round, falling to 41.8% in the second.</p>
                         <p>In April 2019 Peter Kažimír resigned as Minister of Finance, having been appointed as Governor of the central bank the previous December. Ladislav Kamenický of Smer-SD was appointed by Kiska to succeed Kažimír as Minister of Finance on 7 May.</p>
                         <p>In elections to the European Parliament on 25 May 2019, a coalition of PS and another newly formed party, SPOLU—Občianska Demokracia (TOGETHER—Civic Democracy), obtained 20.1% of the votes cast and four seats. Smer-SD was second, with 15.7% and three seats, ahead of ĽSNS, with 12.1% and two seats, the KDH, with 9.7% and one seat, SaS, with 9.6% and two seats, and a coalition of OĽaNO and NOVA, with 5.3% and one seat. The rate of participation, at 22.7% of the electorate, was again the lowest in the EU. Čaputová, the first woman to be elected to the country’s presidency, was inaugurated on 15 June.</p>

                         <heading>The OĽaNO Government</heading>
                         <p>At the elections to the National Council on 29 February 2020, OĽaNO, led by populist Matovič, was the first-placed party, with 25.0% of the votes cast and 53 seats; Smer-SD received 18.3% and 38 seats (its lowest share of the vote since its first general election in 2002), while former coalition parties the SNS and Most/Híd both failed to retain representation. Sme Rodina, with 8.2%, and ĽSNS, with 8.0%, each obtained 17 seats, SaS received 6.2% and 13 seats, and a new party established by former President Kiska, Za Ľudí (For the People), 5.8% and 12 seats. A voter turnout of 65.8% was recorded.</p>
                         <p>On 12 March 2020 the outgoing Government declared a state of emergency in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Measures introduced to contain the virus included the closure of borders, airports and schools. Under a plan presented by Matovič, the staged easing of the restrictions began on 22 April. Meanwhile, on 13 March Matovič announced that he had reached an agreement to form a governing coalition with Sme Rodina, SaS and Za Ľudí. The new Government, headed by Matovič, was appointed by President Čaputová on 21 March. Prominent new members included SaS leader Richard Sulík as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Economy.</p>
                         <p>In response to a sharp rise in cases of COVID-19, a nationwide lockdown was instituted on 19 December 2020. A vaccination programme officially began on 26 December. At the beginning of March 2021 the first delivery of the Russian-developed COVID-19 vaccine known as Sputnik V arrived in Košice, following a procurement order made by Prime Minister Matovič without the approval of the SaS and Za Ľudí government coalition parties. On 11 March the Minister of Health, Marek Krajčí of OĽaNO, announced his resignation, in an attempt to resolve a deepening crisis within the ruling coalition. However, by mid-March SaS and Za Ľudí threatened to withdraw from the Government unless Matovič resigned. Matovič subsequently issued a number of preconditions to his resignation, including that Minister of Justice Mária Kolíková (of Za Ľudí), Sulík and several other prominent government members resign beforehand. On the following day Sulík tendered his resignation as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Economy, in an attempt to force the departure of the Prime Minister. Kolíková also resigned, followed by the Minister of Education, Science, Research and Sport, Branislav Gröhling of SaS, and Minister of Foreign and European Affairs Ivan Korčok (who had been nominated by the party).</p>
                         <p>On 29 March 2021 Matovič agreed to relinquish the premiership, proposing Minister of Finance Eduard Heger of OĽaNO as his successor, although he was to remain in government, receiving Heger’s previous post as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance. After the other coalition parties agreed to the arrangement, on 1 April Čaputová formally appointed Heger as Prime Minister. Sulík was reappointed as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Economy in Heger’s Government, and Kolíková, Korčok and Gröhling were also returned to their former posts. Heger’s Government was endorsed by a vote of confidence in the National Council on 4 May. Meanwhile, the gradual lifting of pandemic-related restrictions began on 19 April. However, following a further severe surge in COVID-19 cases, the Government imposed a new, 90-day state of emergency on 25 November.</p>

                         <p>
            On 9 February 2022 a Defence Co-operation Agreement signed with the USA was approved by the National Council (see 
            <i>Other External Relations</i>
            ), amid protests by opposition deputies and supporters. In response to the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, rallies in support of Ukraine were staged in Bratislava and other major cities two days later. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 state of emergency was lifted on 22 February, after the Government announced a plan to abolish all pandemic-related restrictions. Most domestic measures were accordingly ended on 14 March.
          </p>
                         <p>Following an appeal by ĽSNS leader Kotleba against a prison sentence of more than four years that he had received in 2020 for displaying neo-Nazi sympathies, in early April 2022 the Supreme Court commuted the term to a suspended sentence but upheld his conviction, thereby removing his parliamentary mandate. On 19 April Fico was charged with leading an organized criminal group to wage disinformation campaigns against his political opponents. Several high-ranking former officials, including his former Minister of the Interior Kaliňák and head of police Gašpar, were also charged in connection with the case and detained. However, following a request by the Office of the Prosecutor-General for Fico’s arrest, a vote in the National Council in early May narrowly failed to approve the lifting of his parliamentary immunity.</p>
                         <p>On 5 September 2022 SaS withdrew from the Government (thereby ending its parliamentary majority), following continued acrimony between its Chairman, Sulík, and OĽaNO leader Matovič, who had failed to comply with ultimatums that he resign from his post of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance. In an ensuing government reorganization, Rastislav Káčer was appointed as Minister of Foreign and European Affairs and Viliam Karas as Minister of Justice. A legislative motion of no confidence brought by SaS against the Government, accusing it of failing to support citizens following sharp increases in energy costs, was adopted (with 78 deputies voting in favour) on 15 December. Heger’s administration remained in office in an interim capacity, but failed to secure a new parliamentary majority. After Smer-SD and opposition parties presented a further petition, a referendum proposing amendment of the Constitution to allow pre-term elections was held on 21 January 2023. Although 98.4% of those voting in the referendum supported the proposal, the participation rate of 27.2% rendered the result invalid. Nevertheless, four days later the National Council voted to amend the Constitution to allow early elections, which were subsequently scheduled for 30 September.</p>
                         <p>
            In preparation for the elections, in March 2023 Heger announced his departure from OĽaNO to head the Demokrati (Democrats) party, which had been reconstituted from the dissolved SPOLU—Občianska Demokracia. Shortly afterwards, OĽaNO was reconstituted as an alliance with several smaller parties (including ethnic minority groups), known as OĽaNO a Priatelia (OĽaNO and Friends). Meanwhile, Heger’s interim Government attracted criticism for agreeing to supply fighter jets to Ukraine without parliamentary approval (see 
            <i>Regional Relations</i>
            ). Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Samuel Vlčan resigned on 4 May, after it emerged that a company owned by him had received EU subsidies from the Ministry of the Environment. On the following day Heger made a televised address conceding that the country was in crisis, but seeking to remain in office, prompting the resignation of Káčer as Minister of Foreign and European Affairs. In accordance with opposition demands, Heger announced his resignation on 7 May, in favour of a technocratic administration. President Čaputová appointed the hitherto Deputy Governor of the central bank, Ľudovít Ódor, to head an interim technocratic government pending the legislative elections. However, on 15 June Ódor’s new administration failed to win a parliamentary vote of confidence. Čaputová accordingly dismissed the Government, which was, however, to remain in place with restricted powers pending the legislative elections in September. Meanwhile, Čaputová announced that she would not seek a second term in office. In July the trial began of the central bank Governor, Kažimír, on charges of bribery relating to his previous post as Minister of Finance.

                         <p>In early September 2023 President Čaputová brought legal action against Fico for defamation amid a number of unsubstantiated allegations, including claims that she was a US agent. At the early elections to the National Council on 30 September, Fico’s Smer-SD, which had regained support amid popular discontent at deteriorating economic conditions and which had pledged to end military support for Ukraine, was first-placed, with 22.9% of the votes cast and 42 seats; PS obtained 18.0% and 32 seats, the pro-EU Hlas—Sociálna Demokracia (Voice—Social Democracy, Hlas), led by Pellegrini, won 14.7% and 27 seats, OĽaNO a Priatelia 8.9% and 16 seats, the KDH 6.8% and 12 seats, SaS 6.3% and 11 seats, and the SNS 5.6% and 10 seats. A high voter turnout of 68.5% was recorded. On 11 October Fico signed a coalition agreement with Hlas and the SNS. The Party of European Socialists grouping in the European Parliament subsequently suspended the membership of Smer-SD and Hlas for entering into a coalition with the extreme nationalist SNS. A three-party Government under Fico’s premiership assumed office on 25 October, when Pellegrini was elected as Chairman of the National Council. The new administration included several controversial figures, among them Kaliňák, who became Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence. Matúš Šutaj Eštok of Hlas was appointed as Minister of the Interior and Juraj Blanár of Smer-SD as Minister of Foreign and European Affairs. A government programme secured a vote of confidence in the National Council on 21 November, with 78 deputies voting in favour and 65 against. Shortly afterwards, Šutaj Eštok survived a vote of no confidence brought by the opposition, following his removal of senior police officers and suspension of corruption investigators.</p>
                         <p>The Government in December 2023 proposed an extensive revision of the criminal code, under which penalties for severe crimes would be reduced and the Office of the Special Prosecutor abolished (amid ongoing corruption cases against Smer-SD figures, including Gaspar and Kažimír), on the grounds that it had violated human rights and was biased. The proposed amendment of the penal code prompted a series of large protests in Bratislava and other major cities, together with strong criticism from the European Commission. Nevertheless, it was approved in an expedited procedure by the National Council on 8 February 2024. Following appeals by opposition parties, led by PS, and President Čaputová, part of the amendment was suspended by the Constitutional Court at the end of that month. However, the Special Prosecutor’s Office was officially dissolved on 20 March.</p>
                         <p>Meanwhile, in January 2024 Pellegrini announced that he would contest the forthcoming presidential election; a further 10 candidates also secured registration, including former Minister of Foreign and European Affairs Korčok, Kotleba and SNS leader Andrej Danko. At the first round of the presidential election on 23 March Korčok (an independent candidate) was placed first, receiving 42.5% of the votes cast, followed by Pellegrini, with 37.0%. However, prior to the second round, the ruling coalition officially endorsed Pellegrini’s candidacy, and supported a campaign accusing Korčok of serving foreign interests and planning to undermine the Government’s foreign policy. On 7 April Pellegrini was elected as President, with 53.1% of the votes cast. The voter turnout was 51.9% in the first round and 61.1% in the second. Later that month the Government approved a proposal, which was to be referred to the National Council, to abolish the public broadcaster Rozhlas a Televízia Slovenska (Radio and Television of Slovakia) and replace it with a new body, prompting renewed protests in Bratislava. In addition, on 30 April the National Council approved at the first reading a controversial draft law that would designate non-governmental organizations receiving funding of more than €5,000 from abroad as `organizations with foreign support’.</p>

                    <p id="SK.IS.44440">
          The Roma community in Slovakia was officially enumerated at 67,179 (1.2% of the total population) at the census of 2021. In January 2004 a report by the 
          <xr pageref="Y" ref="CE.IO">Council of Europe</xr>
           concluded that Slovakia’s Roma were frequently victims of racial prejudice and were disadvantaged socially. In the following month proposed reductions in social welfare prompted violent protests by the Roma minority, and some 1,000 troops were deployed to control rioting. In July new legislation was introduced prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of ethnicity. In 2012, for the first time, a member of the Roma community, Peter Pollak, was elected to the National Council. However, he failed to secure re-election in April 2016, when the success of the extreme nationalist ĽSNS caused further concerns among human rights monitors. Meanwhile, in February 2013 the United Nations (UN) Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination expressed concern at the continued segregation of Roma children in schools, a lack of adequate housing in Roma settlements, the forced sterilization of Roma women, and the need to implement anti-discrimination legislation. In April 2015 the European Commission initiated infringement proceedings against Slovakia for breaching EU anti-discrimination legislation in its treatment of Roma schoolchildren. However, a joint report issued by human rights organization Amnesty International and the European Roma Rights Centre (ERRC) in March 2017 found that limited reform had been made by the authorities in that area, with Roma children continuing to be segregated in Roma-only mainstream schools, or in special schools and classes for children with `mild mental disabilities’. After Minister of the Interior Kaliňák in January 2018 presented proposals for the collection of statistics on `Roma crime’ and increases in police powers with regard to Roma suspects, the ERRC announced that it would bring a legal case against the Ministry of the Interior over continued discriminatory practices against Roma. In April 2023 the European Commission announced its decision to refer Slovakia to the European Court of Justice for violating EU rules on racial equality, in particular for failing adequately to address the issue of segregated school education for Roma children.

                         <p id="SK.IS.45">Slovakia is a member, with the Czech Republic—Czechia, Hungary and Poland, of the Visegrad Group (established, following the collapse of communist rule, to promote economic, defence and other co-operation in the region). Slovakia’s relations with Hungary have been strained by issues surrounding a large Hungarian minority resident in Slovakia, who seek cultural and educational autonomy. In March 1995 a historic bilateral Treaty of Friendship and Co-operation was signed by the Governments of Hungary and Slovakia. However, the language law approved by the Slovak legislature in November, declaring Slovak the only official language, was criticized both by Hungarian residents of Slovakia and by the Hungarian Government as a violation of the Treaty. In July 1999 the National Council approved legislation that provided for the use of an ethnic minority language in towns where the minority accounted for at least 20% of the population. (In May 2011 the National Council adopted an amendment to the legislation that lowered this to 15%.)</p>
                         <p>
            Legislation that took effect in Slovakia from 1 September 2009, placing restrictions on the use of languages other than Slovak, was a further source of controversy. Slovakia and Hungary subsequently agreed that the 
            <xr pageref="Y" ref="OSCE.IO">Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)</xr>
             would oversee the implementation of the law to ensure that it complied with international norms. On 26 May 2010 the Hungarian parliament adopted legislation permitting ethnic Hungarians outside Hungary, including in Slovakia, to apply for Hungarian citizenship. Later that day Slovakia’s National Council voted in favour of amending the country’s citizenship law, providing for the removal of Slovak citizenship from those who applied for citizenship of a second state. The new Government of Prime Minister Radičová stated its intention to abrogate the Fico administration’s law on dual citizenship. In February 2011, however, the National Council voted in favour of amending, rather than abolishing, the law, which henceforth allowed citizens to hold dual nationality only if they met certain conditions. In March 2014 Fico and his Hungarian counterpart, Viktor Orbán, inaugurated an EU-financed Hungarian-Slovak natural gas interconnector pipeline, which linked the two countries’ gas networks.

            Negoti­ations on Slovakia’s accession to the EU opened in February 2000. In October 2002 Slovakia was one of 10 nations invited to become a full member from 1 May 2004, following approval of accession by national referendum in the previous year (see 
            <i>Domestic Political Affairs</i>
            ). In December 2007 Slovakia implemented the EU’s Schengen Agreement on freedom of travel. Following Kosovo’s unilateral declaration of independence in February 2008, Slovakia was among several EU member nations to refuse to recognize it as a sovereign state. In May the European Commission approved Slovakia’s accession to the eurozone, which proceeded on 1 January 2009. Following pressure from the European Commission, on 13 October 2011 Slovakia became the final member state of the eurozone to ratify an expanded European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), which had been established to support member states suffering severe financial difficulties. Following a regional crisis precipitated by mass flows of refugees in late 2015, the Slovakian Government disputed the EU’s relocation plan, but agreed to accept a small quota of Syrian refugees.

                         <p>Following Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula in March 2014 and subsequent conflict in parts of eastern Ukraine (see Ukraine), the Slovakian Government observed sanctions imposed by the EU against Russia, but Prime Minister Fico was highly critical of more substantial restrictions introduced from July. Fico met Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Russian capital, Moscow, in August 2016. In March 2018 the Government of Pellegrini recalled its ambassador to Russia for consultations, but refrained from joining numerous other EU states in expelling Russian diplomats in response to an alleged Russian nerve agent attack in the UK (see the Russian Federation). However, in November Pellegrini announced the expulsion of a Russian diplomat who was accused of espionage. Following the Czech Republic’s expulsion in April 2021 of 18 Russian diplomats over suspicions of Russian military intelligence involvement in an explosion in the country in 2014, Slovakia expelled three Russian diplomats in a demonstration of solidarity. The Russian Government subsequently expelled three Slovakian diplomats.</p>
                         <p>
            Slovakian government leaders strongly denounced Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. In March three Russian diplomats were expelled from Slovakia on suspicion of espionage, prompting the expulsion of three Slovakian diplomats by Russia. At the end of that month the Slovakian Government expelled a further 35 embassy personnel. Following the imposition of wide-ranging sanctions against Russia by the EU, the USA and other states, Slovakia, together with the Czech Republic and Hungary, was granted a temporary exemption from an EU ban on imports of Russian crude oil delivered by pipeline (which entered into effect in December), owing to its high energy dependence on Russia. By early May 2022 Slovakia had supplied military aid worth €200m., including a S-300 air defence system, to Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky made an address via video link to the National Council on 10 May (during which former premier Fico and other Smer-SD deputies left the chamber) and urged further support for Ukraine. President Čaputová met Zelensky during a visit to Ukraine at the end of that month. On 16 February 2023 the National Council adopted a resolution designating Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism and again declaring support for Ukraine.

            Slovakia signed an inter-governmental agreement with Ukraine on the provision of fighter jets on 17 March. The first four Soviet-designed aircraft were transferred to Ukraine shortly afterwards and interim Prime Minister Heger visited Ukraine at the end of the month. In April Slovakia announced a ban on the import of grain and other agricultural imports from Ukraine, after Poland and Hungary had imposed similar bans, in response to protests by farmers over the impact of the tariff-free imports on local prices. The European Commission criticized the bans as unacceptable. Čaputová and Czech President Petr Pavel made a state visit to Ukraine on 28 April, meeting Zelensky and visiting sites of suspected war crimes committed by Russian forces. In September the Slovakian Government announced that it would end a renewed ban on grain imports from Ukraine, after reaching a preliminary agreement on a licensing system with Ukraine (which had filed a complaint against Hungary, Poland and Slovakia at the 
            <xr pageref="Y" ref="WTO.IO">World Trade Organization</xr>
            ). Immediately after returning to government in October, Prime Minister Fico announced that Slovakia would no longer supply weapons to Ukraine and would henceforth only provide humanitarian aid; however, he later indicated that he would not oppose exports by Slovakian private defence companies to Ukraine.

                         <p>In February 1994 Slovakia joined NATO’s Partnership for Peace’ programme. At a NATO summit meeting in Prague at the end of November 2002, Slovakia was formally invited to join the Alliance, and it became a full member on 29 March 2004. In November 2013 Prime Minister Fico met US President Barack Obama in Washington, DC, USA, where US-Slovak co-operation was discussed. Following increased geopolitical tensions resulting from the conflict in Ukraine (see above), in October 2015 NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg announced that a new command centre was to be installed in Slovakia (as well as in Hungary), to complement six existing bases in Eastern Europe. The new NATO headquarters in Bratislava was officially established in January 2017.</p>

            A controversial Defence Co-operation Agreement, allowing the US military to use two Slovak air force bases for 10 years, and providing for Slovakia to receive US&#160;$100m. from the USA for their modernization, was signed by Slovakian Minister of Defence Jaroslav Naď and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Washington, DC, on 3 February 2022, and received parliamentary approval soon afterwards. After authorizing NATO overflights, on 9 March the Government approved the presence of a NATO enhanced forward presence battalion in Slovakia; the proposal was endorsed by the National Council on 15 March. US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin visited Slovakia two days later. Jill Biden, the wife of US President Joe Biden, visited the eastern border town of Košice on 8 May, meeting Slovakian government leaders and pledging support to Ukrainian refugees. At November the NATO battlegroup based in the Lešť area totalled 1,056 troops, led by the Czech Republic and also comprising personnel from Germany, Slovakia and Slovenia. In March 2023 the USA offered to sell Slovakia 12 new military helicopters at a substantial discount, following Slovakia’s agreement to supply fighter jets to Ukraine. Despite the stance of a new Fico Government on ending military aid to Ukraine (see 
            <i>Regional Relations</i>
            ), on 1 March 2024 Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence Kaliňák met Austin in Washington, DC, to discuss enhanced defence co-operation.

               <p id="SK.IS.58">Energy is derived principally from nuclear power, which provided some 58.2% of electricity generated in 2015. In that year hydroelectric power accounted for 14.5% of electricity production, and coal for 12.5%. A nuclear power station at Jaslovské-Bohunice has been in operation since the early 1980s, although two reactors there were closed in 2006 and 2008. In 1998 the first block of a new nuclear power installation, at Mochovce, commenced operations; construction work on two unfinished reactors there was ongoing. According to official preliminary figures, mineral fuels and lubricants accounted for 8.7% of the value of total merchandise imports in 2023.</p>

In 2023, according to official preliminary figures, the principal source of imports was Germany, which accounted for 14.3% of the total; other major suppliers were the Czech Republic, the People’s Republic of China, Poland, the Republic of Korea (South Korea) and Poland. Germany was also the principal market for exports in that year (accounting for 21.0%); other important purchasers were the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, France and Austria. The main imports in 2023 were machinery, mechanical appliances and electrical equipment, mineral products, vehicles and transport equipment, mineral products, iron and steel, other base metals and articles of base metal, chemicals and related products, and plastics and rubber.

        <xr pageref="Y" ref="WB02047.IO.TXT">European Union (EU)</xr>
         closed an excessive deficit procedure against Slovakia in June 2014, after the general government deficit had been successfully reduced. Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government introduced containment restrictions, together with support measures, including wage subsidization for affected businesses and greater social benefits. In 2020 real GDP contracted by 3.3%; however, growth resumed at a rate of 4.9% in 2021, despite the reinstatement of pandemic-related restrictions in that year. Slovakia was vulnerable to the regional impact of the wide-ranging sanctions that were imposed by the EU against Russia, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Owing to its high energy dependence on Russia, Slovakia received a temporary exemption from an EU ban on the import of Russian seaborne crude oil that entered into effect in December, and was also permitted to export certain refined oil products obtained from Russian crude oil to Ukraine. However, a surge in global food and fuel prices (with the domestic annual inflation rate reaching more than 15% in early 2023) caused a severe cost of living crisis. Popular discontent contributed to the collapse of the Government by a parliamentary vote of no confidence in December. In 2022 the rate of real GDP growth in Slovakia declined to 1.8%. In June 2023 the European Commission approved Slovakia’s modified post-pandemic National Recovery and Resilience Plan, which was allocated €6,400m. in grants for its implementation. 
        <!--https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_6017-->
        In September Slovakia submitted a third payment request, for €662m. in grants, under the EU’s Recovery and Resilience Facility (having by that time received €1,900m., including €823m. in pre-financing). Following political instability and early legislative elections, a new coalition Government, under the premiership of Robert Fico, was established in October. Government measures of €1,500m., intended to consolidate public finances, were adopted in December; these included a new levy of 30% on bank profits and an extended `solidarity’ tax of 70% on excess oil profits. Amid depressed private consumption, 
        
        growth in real GDP slowed to an estimated 1.1% in 2023. However, annual consumer price inflation had declined significantly, to a rate of 2.3% by March 2024.
