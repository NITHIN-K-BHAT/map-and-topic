          <heading>Introduction</heading>
          <p id="SLOVENIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P1">Slovenia is a small, export-orientated economy with a population of just over 2m. people, located at a major transport crossroads, with easy access to the markets of Central and South-Eastern Europe. It was the most developed republic of Yugoslavia, accounting for gross domestic product (GDP) per head twice that of most other parts of that country (except for Croatia and the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, in northern Serbia). It gained independence in 1991, experiencing an economic downturn in 1990-92 and then recovering in 1993, reaching a GDP growth rate of up to 5.4% by 1999. Compared with other post-socialist countries, it surpassed the pre-transition level of economic performance relatively quickly: the 1990 level of pre-transition development was reached in 1996, and in 1998 the country attained the level of development recorded in 1987, when Yugoslavia’s economic output had started to decline. Unemployment levels were high during the transition period, exceeding over 14% by the mid-1990s and not falling below 10% until 2005, and the inflation rate decreased from 32.3% in 1993 to 7.9% in 1998 and 5.6% in 2003.</p>
          <p id="SLOVENIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P2">Slovenia undertook a gradual and pragmatic approach to market transition compared with other post-socialist economies. By 1992 it had conducted fiscal reform, established a banking and foreign exchange system, privatized most of its stake in the housing sector and adopted legislation on the denationalization and privatization of co-operatives. Externally, the state liberalized economic relations with the rest of the world, especially through the elimination of quantitative restrictions on imports and the gradual reduction of tariff barriers. By the mid-1990s Slovenia had privatized 54% of its firms (according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development—OECD), a proportion comparable with the extent of privatization in Poland at the time (55%), but much less than that undertaken in the Czech Republic (87%) and Slovakia (74%). By the end of the 1990s the banking sector was still predominantly under domestic ownership, with ownership capital of 41.4% held by the state. Since independence Slovenia has conducted a restrictive monetary and fiscal policy with a managed floating exchange rate regime. Slovenia’s process of accession to the European Union (EU) began in 1997, and it became a member of the EU and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 2004. It adopted the euro and became a member of the Schengen area of border-free travel in 2007.</p>
          <p id="SLOVENIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P3">Constitutionally, Slovenia is a socially orientated state, characterized by strong state involvement in public services provision and the compulsory social insurance systems for the protection of employees and their family members. In practice, however, since the 2008 financial crisis there have been important changes in the social welfare system. In 2019 the country’s Gini coefficient (a measure of income inequality) was 0.24, and the at-risk-of-poverty or social exclusion rate was 14.4%. This rate was highest in the regions of Zasavska (21.4%) and Koroška (19.3%), and the lowest in those of Gorenjska (9.6%), Osrednjeslovenska and Posavska (11.6% in both cases). The employment rate in 2019 was 76.4%, and the female employment rate was 72.9%, which is higher than the EU average. The unemployment rate in 2019 was 4.5%, and the youth unemployment rate was 8.1%. Real GDP per head was €19,190 in 2008 and €20,700 in 2019. The level of development before the impact of the global financial crisis on Slovenia in 2008 was 91% of the EU average, and by 2019 it had climbed back to only 89% of the average.</p>
          <p id="SLOVENIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P4">The principal economic sectors are the automobile industry, logistics and transport, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, electronics, information and communications technology, machinery and metalworking, and wood processing. In 2022 the agricultural sector contributed only 1.9% of overall economic output, while industry accounted for 32.8% and services for 65.3%. In that year the agricultural sector employed 4.3% of the employed labour force, the industrial sector 30.1% and the services sector 65.7%. In 2019 Slovenian farms produced 44.1% of the country’s fruit consumption, 43.2% of vegetable consumption, 81.0% of meat consumption and 74.8% of cereals consumption. Since 1991 the share of agriculture in GDP has decreased by more than one-half, from 5.7%. The share of industry has also declined, from 44% of GDP in 1991, while that of services has increased significantly, from 50.3% of GDP in 1991.</p>

          <heading>Financial Crisis and its Aftermath (2008-14)</heading>
          <p id="SLOVENIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P5">The Slovenian economy was gravely affected by the 2008 financial crisis, with rates of economic growth falling from the high level of 6.9% recorded in 2007 to 3.3% in 2008, and GDP then contracting by 7.8% in 2009. Exports fell year on year by almost 30% in 2009, and the unemployment rate increased from 4.1% in September to 11.1% in March 2013. Real GDP per head fell from €19,200 in 2008 to €17,000 in 2013, representing a decline of 11.4%. Relative to the EU average, living standards decreased from 89.5% in 2008 to 81.6% in 2013. A significant domestic factor that led to the contraction in economic output was a slump in investment, both in the corporate sector and in housing construction. The crisis was preceded by credit expansion in the property sector, which was enabled by lower inter-bank interest rates and easier access to international financial markets after entry into the EU’s exchange rate mechanism (ERM-II) in June 2004 and prior to the adoption of the euro in 2007. The number of loans to the non-banking sector increased by almost two-thirds between 2006 and 2008. Consequently, when the property market contracted in 2010, large construction companies such as Slovenija Ceste Tehnika, Primorje and Vegrad, collapsed. The availability of credit was reduced by more than one-third between 2010 and 2016. as domestic banks deleveraged to pay back their foreign loans rather than to extend new loans to Slovenian businesses.</p>
          <p id="SLOVENIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P6">The newly elected centre-left Government led by Prime Minister Borut Pahor initially believed in 2008 that the economic crisis would be short-term and thus focused its policy response primarily on providing fiscal stimulus to households and companies. The Government adopted the first package of fiscal measures in December, followed by another set in February 2009. The fiscal stimulus included subsidies for investment in new technologies and research and development (R&amp;D) in companies, partial subsidies for companies that temporarily introduced shorter labour hours, state guarantees for additional foreign borrowing by banks and lending to companies through the capitalization of the state development SID Bank, loans and subsidies towards the operating costs of vulnerable industrial sectors, retraining programmes for workers and the energy rehabilitation of buildings in public ownership. Fiscal stimulus was estimated at 2.1% of GDP. Moreover, as part of its policy response to the crisis, the Government also increased expenditure to finance additional unemployment benefits (under the Special Allowance for Socially Disadvantaged Persons Act). During this time the level of public debt increased from 21.8% of GDP in 2008 to 34.6% in 2009, and the budget deficit increased from 1.4% to 5.8%.</p>
          <p id="SLOVENIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P7">At the end of 2009 Slovenia came under the EU’s excessive deficit procedure, whereby it was required to bring its budget deficit under control. The Government responded by adopting a fiscal consolidation and structural reform agenda, the `Slovenian Exit Strategy 2010-2013’. The main objective of the strategy was to raise economic growth and boost competitiveness through the consolidation of public finances. Measures notably included the introduction of fiscal regulations, a reduction in public sector workers of 1%, the rationalization of services provided by the public sector, and the relaxation of restrictions in labour markets through the reduction of labour costs and structural reforms of the pension system, long-term care and the health system. However, owing to fierce resistance from the opposition, trade unions, students and other civil society actors, which culminated in the rejection of three major reforms at referendums, only a few of the structural reforms adopted were implemented. One example was the welfare reform (Social Assistance Benefits Act), which was adopted in 2010 and only gained public attention after it started to be implemented in 2012. The reform limited the right to social assistance by income and the property status of the claimant, moving welfare policy in Slovenia away from a universal system of social rights towards a more targeted set of means-tested measures.</p>
          <p id="SLOVENIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P8">In February 2012 a centre-right coalition led by Prime Minister Janez Janša came to power and more systematically undertook to consolidate public finances. The Government adopted the Fiscal Balance Act in May, which amended 40 other laws in an express parliamentary procedure, after reaching an agreement with trade unions. The `superlaw’ introduced changes such as a reduction in pay for public sector workers, limitation of the recruitment of new public sector workers, lower public investment (e.g. in the housing sector or infrastructure), lower unemployment benefits and lower parental benefits. The Government also adopted a pension reform, increasing the retirement age to 65 years for both men and women (previously, the effective retirement age was 63 years for men and 61 for women), and a labour market reform, which relaxed the procedures for creating employment and dismissing workers. These measures helped to lower the budget deficit to 4% of GDP in 2012, although this was still in breach of EU criteria (which set a maximum of 3%). After charges brought by the anti-corruption commission against Prime Minister Janša and a series of public protests between 2012 and 2013, the coalition Government collapsed in February 2013.</p>
          <p id="SLOVENIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P9">In March 2013 a new centre-left coalition was formed by the opposition under the premiership of Alenka Bratušek, amid turmoil in the financial market. The banking system was facing severe solvency and liquidity problems, and a major recapitalization of banks could be delayed no longer. Hence, the Government’s main objectives were to restructure the banking system, consolidate public finances without curbing growth, and improve the management of state assets. In the same month the Bank Assets Management Company was established, popularly known as `the bad bank’, which purchased non-performing loans from banks of systemic importance: in 2013, from the two largest banks, Nova Ljubljanska Banka (now NLB) and Nova KBM (NKBM), and by the end of 2014, from Abanka Vipa and Banka Celje. The central bank, Banka Slovenije, headed by Governor Boštjan Jazbec, conducted stress tests in mid-2013 to assess the banks’ risk-based capital requirements. On the basis of the results, which were later disputed, and the belated approval of the European Commission, in December the Government recapitalized three government-owned banks (NLB, NKBM and Abanka Vipa) and two smaller banks undergoing special administration (Factor Banka and Probanka). The bank bailouts raised the general government deficit by 10.3% of GDP in 2013 (to 14.7% of GDP overall). As a result, public debt amounted to 71.7% of GDP at the end of 2013.</p>
          <p id="SLOVENIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P10">Among other crisis measures, the Bratušek Government also introduced a new enterprise finance guarantee scheme to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), including €140m. allocated to ongoing projects and the creation of at least 2,000 new jobs in different regions of the country, €5m. to 200 micro- and small enterprises, €100m. to R&amp;D in SMEs, and €400m. to financial engineering instruments for SMEs. Moreover, the Government continued to reduce both the number of public sector workers and public sector wages. The main value-added tax (VAT) rate was raised from 20% to 22%, and the reduced VAT rate from 8.5% to 9.5% (on goods such as food, medicine, passenger transport and books), and exporters were exempt.</p>

          <heading>Stabilization and Return to Strong Economic Growth (2014-18) </heading>
          <p id="SLOVENIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P11">Under the Bratušek Government, privatization processes were accelerated. The Minister of Finance in Janša’s administration, Janez Šušteršič, had already started to prepare an act providing for the establishment of the Slovenian Sovereign Holding (SDH), which would centralize and provide a uniform framework for the management of state capital assets. The act was revised under the Bratušek Government and adopted in March 2014. It followed the OECD Guidelines on Corporate Governance of State-Owned Enterprises and stipulated a non-controlling treatment of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) by the state to improve their competitiveness and decrease political influence over their management. Until the SDH began to operate in practice, the Slovenian Restitution Fund managed the portfolio assets. The Bratušek Government also prepared a list of 15 SOEs to be divested, which was ratified in June 2013, comprising airline Adria Airways; manufacturer of drawing materials Aero; sporting goods manufacturer Elan; laser systems manufacturer Fotona; coatings manufacturer Helios; airport Aerodrom; aeroplane maintenance provider Adria Airways Tehnika; NKBM bank; telecommunications company Telekom Slovenije; chemical processing company Cinkarna Celje; exhibition and convention centre Gospodarsko Razstavišče; hygienic paper manufacturer Paloma; spa resort Terme Olimia; tools manufacturer Unior; and food manufacturer Žito.</p>
          <p id="SLOVENIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P12">In May 2014 Bratušek resigned as Prime Minister. Following elections in July, a new Government was formed in September, led by Miro Cerar, leader of the most successful party, which was initially named the Stranka Mira Cerarja (SMC—Party of Miro Cerar) before being renamed the Stranka Modernega Centra (Modern Centre Party). Securing 36 seats in the 90-member legislature, the SMC managed to attract the support of voters with a platform for creating corruption-free and more effective public institutions, improved rule of law and a revised privatization programme. The party also pledged to keep strategic infrastructure under state ownership. In July 2015 the parliament ratified an asset management strategy prepared by the Government, which for the first time defined the principles and objectives of the state’s active management of SOEs, and classified SOEs into strategic, important and portfolio assets. Despite anti-privatization rhetoric during the electoral campaign, the Government continued with the privatization processes of the 15 companies designated for divestiture by the previous administration.</p>
          <p id="SLOVENIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P13">By mid-2019 nine of the companies on the list had been sold. Helios was sold to the Austrian holding Ring in 2013 and then sold again within two years to the Japanese Kansai Paint. Fotona was purchased by the Gores Group and Technology4Medicine (both of the USA) and then sold to the Chinese-European fund AGIC Capital. Adria Airways was sold to the German restructuring fund 4K Invest, and Žito was acquired by the Croatian food company Podravka. NKBM bank was sold to US-based private equity fund Apollo and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Telekom Slovenije was due to be purchased by the British private equity firm Cinven in 2015; however, in August Cinven withdrew from the negotiations, and the privatization process was abandoned. In 2015 public opinion pollsters reported that the majority of Slovenian respondents opposed the sale of strategic state capital assets, such as Telekom Slovenije, but most political parties in Slovenia were, at least nominally, in favour. Following persistent pressure from the European Commission, the Government was also planning to sell a majority stake in NLB; however, owing to public and political opposition, the privatization process stalled until the end of 2018.</p>
          <p id="SLOVENIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P14">In 2017 the Government was also successful in concluding greenfield investment deals with the Yaskawa Electric Corporation of Japan and automobile manufacturer Magna Steyr, creating new job opportunities in areas with high unemployment rates. Yaskawa’s new investment project, involving a new robot factory and a European robotics R&amp;D centre, was valued at €25m. and was expected to create at least 200 new jobs in the southern town of Kočevje. The Slovenian Government contributed €5.6m. in grants to the project. The new factory was inaugurated in April 2019 and was expected to produce up to 10,000 industrial robots per year, satisfying around 80% of the European market’s demand for Motoman industrial robots. Magna Steyr, based in Austria and forming part of the Canadian Magna International group, constructed a new paint shop in Hoče, near Maribor, in what was planned to be the first phase of its expansion into Slovenia. The new plant was to employ some 400 people and represented about €86m. of investment. The Slovenian Government supported the investment with a subsidy of €18.6m., requiring Magna to employ at least 1,000 workers and invest over €100m. overall in the first five years, and a special law (referred to as `Lex Magna’ in the media) was adopted to enable a speedy acquisition of land for the industrial zone.</p>
          <p id="SLOVENIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P15">Operations at the plant were delayed, however, because environmental non-governmental organizations (NGOs) appealed against the granting of an environmental permit by the environment agency. The NGOs raised concerns about the effects of the investment project on the local forests, the quality of air and drinking water, as well as on the established procedures in construction, environmental and spatial planning legislation. After achieving a planned increased control of the water-protection area around Magna, the NGOs considered their demands to be satisfied. As a result of pressure from the NGOs, the Government also had to amend the Lex Magna to clarify that the investment would be exempt from Article 69 of the Waters Act, which prohibits the use or storage of hazardous materials in water-protection areas. Eventually, Magna commenced the trial phase of production in March 2019. This case shows the willingness of Slovenian governments to accommodate the needs of foreign investors, while putting aside environmental concerns.</p>
          <p id="SLOVENIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P16">By 2016 the Slovenian economy had moved from recovery into rapid expansion, registering growth of 2.3% in GDP in 2015, 3.1% in 2016 and 4.9% in 2017. Exports were the strongest contributor to economic growth, which also reflected an improved global business environment. In 2017 exports of automobiles, electrical and other equipment, pharmaceutical products, metals and chemical products contributed most significantly to the increase in exports of goods. Economic growth was also supported by a sharp increase in private sector investment, which was financed by retained earnings in the corporate sector rather than through borrowing. Domestic consumption was also increasingly important, strengthening in line with rapid growth in employment, and supported by higher wage growth in the second half of 2017. Increased government expenditure was another important factor contributing to higher growth, which was restrained to enable visible improvement in the general government fiscal balance. As a result, the European Commission ended the excessive deficit procedure for Slovenia in June 2016. Despite these positive trends, real GDP returned to pre-crisis levels only in 2017, almost 10 years after the financial crisis.</p>
          <p id="SLOVENIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P17">The return to strong economic growth and falling levels of unemployment encouraged public sector trade unions to demand a higher share of profits for workers at the end of 2017 and in early 2018. The trade unions demanded a general increase in pay, the abolition of austerity measures, including the reduction in public sector wages, and a government guarantee of funds for the pay increase. These demands were in addition to an existing agreement with the Government, reached in December 2016, which rescinded most of the austerity measures in the public sector imposed from 2012 (to be implemented in 2018-19), and followed partial pay increase agreements between the Government and the police, doctors and firefighters. After a series of strikes and protests by public sector workers, and a decision by the Supreme Court to repeat a referendum on a controversial major railway project planned by the Government, Prime Minister Cerar resigned in March 2018.</p>
          <p id="SLOVENIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P18">In an early election in June 2018, the party of former premier Janša, the Slovenska Demokratska Stranka (Slovenian Democratic Party), was first-placed, with 25 seats; however, as left-wing and centre-left parties won most of the remaining seats, it was not able to form a coalition. The Lista Marjana Šarca (LMŠ—List of Marjan Šarec), the second strongest party, formed a minority Government with other centre-left organizations, supported by Levica (The Left) alliance. During the pre-election campaign, the LMŠ leader, Šarec, declared support for electoral reform (raising the parliamentary threshold from the current 4% to ensure more stable governments) and health care reform, and opposed the privatization of strategic companies and the complete privatization of the banking sector. He also pledged to maintain balanced budgets and continue with the reduction of public debt if future economic growth allowed it. Following pledges under the coalition agreement to raise the minimum wage by including capital gains in income taxation, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Slovenia and various business lobbies threatened to move their production and investment abroad.</p>
          <p id="SLOVENIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P19">Owing to continued pressure from the European Commission, the Government sold a 65% stake in the largest Slovenian bank, NLB, in late 2018, and was required to divest a further 10% of shares by the end of 2019, so that the state would be left only with 25% plus one share. The Government also privatized the third largest bank, Abanka (formed by the merger of Abanka Vipa and Banka Celje in 2015); in June 2019 SDH announced that NKBM had been selected to purchase the 100% state interest in Abanka for €444m.; the transaction was completed in February 2020. Meanwhile, in December 2018 the new Government reached an agreement with trade unions over public sector pay. The Government also raised the minimum wage from €638 to €667 (after taxes) in 2019, and it increased it again in 2020, to €700 (after taxes). Owing to strong economic growth in 2017, the final austerity measures in social transfers were abolished from 1 January 2019.</p>
          <p id="SLOVENIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P20">Despite presiding over a positive economic climate (with GDP growth of 4.4% in 2018 and 3.2% in 2019), as well as implementing pay increases for public sector workers and workers on a minimum wage, the minority Šarec Government collapsed in January 2020, owing to a lack of support among coalition partners for implementing the agreed structural reforms, including in the health care sector.</p>

          <heading>The COVID-19 Crisis and Future Challenges</heading>
          <p id="SLOVENIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P21">In March 2020 Janša formed a centre-right coalition Government in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing economic crisis. By mid-March Slovenia’s export markets and the principal supply chains in the manufacturing industry had been disrupted, leading to a fall in demand. At the same time, Slovenia went into a general lockdown, which banned all non-essential service activities. All schools, bars, restaurants, hotels, shops (apart from food stores and pharmacies), sports centres and cultural institutions were closed and all public transport, including air traffic, was put on hold. By the end of April a total of 88,648 persons were unemployed—some 20% more than one year earlier. Consumer confidence saw the greatest fall among the different measures of economic sentiment, registering a 15-year low. (The overall unemployment rate increased to 5.0% in 2020, from 4.5% in 2019, before declining to 4.8% in 2021.)</p>
          <p id="SLOVENIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P22">In early April 2020 parliament approved the so-called `Anti-corona Mega Law’, comprising a set of government intervention measures worth about €3,000m. (some 6% of GDP) to help businesses and individuals to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic. The measures included direct grants to businesses, wage subsidies, exemptions from paying social security contributions, the reduction of certain taxes and water fees, bank guarantees, the deferred payment of certain credits and compensatory payments. One-off financial assistance was also given to students, large families, and pensioners whose monthly pension was lower than the minimum wage. The legislative package included a wage increase for those working in difficult conditions, for example, doctors and nurses, and reduced the wages of government officials by 30% for the duration of the epidemic. At the end of April Slovenia adopted another package of business support, which would offer state guarantees of up to €2,000m. (about 4% of GDP) for loans to companies.</p>
          <p id="SLOVENIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P24">The Government started to relax lockdown measures at the end of April 2020, allowing most shops to open. By mid-May most schools, kindergartens, libraries and cultural institutions had also reopened. Social life in Slovenia returned to a `new normal’ by the end of May, but a second wave of infection spread later in the year, and a new lockdown was imposed in October. According to Eurostat, Slovenia’s GDP contracted by 4.2% in 2020, but it recovered strongly, with growth of 8.1% in 2021. Statistics from the Institute of Macroeconomic Analysis and Development showed that although there was a sharp decline in the export of goods at the time of the first lockdown in April 2020, by the end of that year goods exports had recovered to pre-crisis levels. On the reopening of parts of the services sector in February 2021, household expenditure in retail increased, and sales in March surpassed those during the same period in 2019. Private consumption continued to be one of the most important drivers of economic growth during 2021, while exports began to slow down by the end of that year, due to supply chain disruptions. </p>
          <p id="SLOVENIA.ECONOMY.ED.DF.P25">Following an agreement by the European Council in July 2020, EU member states established the Next Generation EU fund, providing for a recovery and resilience programme worth a total of €672,500m. in loans and grants to aid economic recovery from the COVID-19 crisis. Slovenia was expected to receive almost €2,500m. in support under the EU’s recovery fund, including €1,777m. in grants and €705m. in loans available until 2026. To access the EU funds, the Slovenian Government submitted a national recovery plan to the European Commission in April 2021, which received approval from the Commission in July. Slovenia was expected to undertake 34 reforms and 58 investments, with 43% of the funds designated to green transition projects, 13% towards digital transformation, 30% towards smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and 15% to health. To meet its international obligations under the Paris Agreement on fighting climate change, Slovenia was also required to phase out the operations of its two lignite-powered plants (in Šoštanj and Ljubljana) over the next two decades. In January 2022 the Janša Government set 2033 as the target date for ending the use of coal for the production of electric energy in Slovenia. </p>
          <p>In April 2022 the liberal Gibanje Svoboda (Freedom Movement) won the parliamentary elections in Slovenia with almost 35% of the votes cast, securing 41 seats in the 90-member National Assembly. It subsequently formed a centre-left coalition Government with the Socialni Demokrati (Social Democrats) and the Levica (The Left) party, which was approved by the National Assembly at the beginning of June. The new coalition Government, led by Prime Minister Robert Golob, declared the fight against climate change and the green energy transition, intergenerational solidarity, digitalization and regional development in Slovenia to be its main priorities. In March 2023 Slovenia received an instalment of €50m. in grants out of the total allocated under the EU’s post-pandemic Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), following the fulfilment of the first package of regulatory, public administration and business environment reforms demanded by the European Commission. This followed a disbursement of €231m. in RRF pre-financing in September 2021, to be used for the upgrading of strategic railway infrastructure and stations, projects aimed at the digitalization of the economy and the extension of infectious disease clinics at the University Medical Centre Ljubljana and in Maribor.</p>

      The new Government’s ambitious plans were quickly undermined by the economic environment brought about by the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, which impeded post-pandemic economic recovery. This led to an increase in electricity and natural gas prices across the EU, with prices tripling between September 2021 and August 2022. The war in Ukraine also caused sharp increases in agricultural commodity prices in the EU, with the price of milk, cheese and eggs rising by 27% year-on-year in March 2023, fats and oils by 23%, and bread and cereals by 20%. Supply chain blockages resulting from both the continuing effects of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, and the energy and food price increases
      
      , drove the inflation rate in the euro area to 10.6% in October 2022. In Slovenia, consumer prices increased by an average of 8.8% in 2022 (compared with 1.9% in 2021). In order to alleviate the cost of living crisis for households, public sector organizations and businesses, the Government introduced energy price caps and lowered the VAT rate on energy consumption. It also adopted subsidy programmes to offset the increased energy costs for small businesses and large companies.

          <p>With ongoing negotiations on the revision of the EU’s fiscal rules, public debt reduction again became an important item on the Slovenian Government’s agenda. Under agreed proposals, the requirement for budget deficits not to exceed 3% of GDP and public debt 60% of GDP would remain the same. However, governments with public debt above 60% of GDP would negotiate individual debt reduction plans with the European Commission, rather than following the standard annual debt cuts of one-20th of the excess above 60% of GDP. In 2021 Slovenia’s budget deficit amounted to 4.6%, while in 2022 it was reduced to 3.0% of GDP. Likewise, public debt as a percentage of GDP stood at 74.5% in 2021, but dropped to 69.9% in 2022.</p>
          <p>The cost of living crisis and renewed efforts to restrain public debt levels have delayed many of the reforms pledged by Prime Minister Golob during the 2022 electoral campaign. At mid-2023, one year after its formation, the new Government was still seeking consensus among societal stakeholders and developing the outlines of the promised reforms, principally in the areas of income tax, public sector pay and salary rises due to high inflation, the public health care sector and elderly care. In the area of public health care, after an announcement by a major private health care insurance company of a sharp rise in health care plan premiums caused an outcry, the Government decided in April 2023 to abolish voluntary insurance fees for additional health care coverage in favour of a fixed mandatory contribution, planning to adopt the necessary legislation by 1 September.</p>
