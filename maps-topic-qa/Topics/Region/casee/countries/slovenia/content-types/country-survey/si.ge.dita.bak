          <p id="SI.GEOG.1">The Republic of Slovenia lies in south-central Europe. Slovenia has frontiers with Italy in the west, Austria to the north, Hungary along a short border in the east, and its southern border is with Croatia. In the south-west of the country there is a short coastal strip of 40 km (25 miles) on the Adriatic Sea, around the Istrian port of Koper (Capodistria). The country covers an area of 20,273 sq km (7,827 sq miles).</p>
          <p id="SI.GEOG.2">Slovenia is an Alpine area, being dominated by the Julian and Karawanken Alps. Slo­venia’s highest peak, Triglav (2,864&#160;m, 9,394&#160;ft), is in the Julian Alps, close to the northern part of the border with Italy. Most of the territory is mountainous, the main areas of lower terrain being in the south-west near the coast, in the central southern areas, along the Sava river, and in the north-east around the Mura river, where Slovenia becomes a narrowing strip of territory abutting onto the Pannonian plains. The country’s river valleys and its Karst region (a limestone plateau in the Dinaric Alps) contribute to the agri­cultural territory, and some 58% of the country is forested.</p>

          <heading>Population</heading>
          <p id="SI.GEOG.4">
      The population of Slovenia was officially enumerated at 2,116,972 at 1 January 2023, giving a population density of 104.4 per sq&#160;km. At the 2
      
      002 census 83.1% of the population were ethnic Slovenes. The largest minority ethnic groups in Slovenia were Serbs (2.0%), Croats (1.8%) and Bosniaks (1.1%). The official language is Slovene, a Southern Slavonic tongue, which is distinct from the principal languages spoken in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro and Serbia. Hungarian and Italian also have official status in those regions (of the north-east and south-west, respectively) where there are significant numbers of native speakers of those languages. The traditional religion of the Slovenes is Christianity, as practised by the Roman Catholic Church, to which most of the population adhere. There are small communities of other Christian denomin­ations, including Eastern Orthodox Christians, and of Muslims and Jews. The capital of Slovenia is Ljubljana, the largest city in the country, with a population of 296,228 at 1 January 2023, according to official estimates. It is located in the centre-west of Slovenia. Other important towns include Maribor (population estimated at 113,000), Kranj (57,171), Koper (Capodistria, 53,875) and Celje (48,776).
