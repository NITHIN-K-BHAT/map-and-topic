          <p>
      The ancestors of the modern Slovenes probably settled in the eastern Alps in the fifth or sixth centuries, and formed part of a succession of mass movements from the east by Slavonic tribes. The oldest piece of writing in the Slovene language, the ninth century Freising Fragments, are considered by some to represent a transitional phase between the Late Common Slavic and Slovene languages, and by nationalists to represent an important stage in Slovenia’s road to statehood. The extent of Slavonic settlement in the Alps was initially much wider, but this territory diminished over the centuries, and by the 21st century, outside Slovenia, Slovene was spoken only by small minorities in Austria and Italy, whose traditional culture had come under various assimilatory pressures. As a political state Slovenia was a relative latecomer, really only coming into existence as a Yugoslav republic at the end of 1945. Nevertheless, Slovenia’s national history covers several centuries, as a discernible national consciousness clearly existed by the 16th century and probably predated this period. In the seventh century the Slovenes had an elaborate investiture ceremony, which determined who would be Duke of Karantanija (roughly equivalent to modern Carinthia). Although the ducal stone used for this ceremony is in modern-day Austria, the modern Slovene state resisted Kosovo-style irredentism (by not using the stone as a national symbol) and pursued a policy of good relations with its northern neighbour. After 745

      , the Slovenes lived under the domination of the Franks and were incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire and the Catholic Church.

          <heading>The Slovenes Under Habsburg Domination</heading>
          <p>The Habsburg dynasty acquired Styria in 1278, followed by Carniola and Carinthia in 1335 and Trieste (Trst) in 1385. Other than those residing in a small area of Italy, the vast majority of Slovenes lived under Habsburg rule until 1918. On the whole, Slovene was the language of the peasants ruled over by a German-speaking nobility, although sections of the nobility such as the Dukes of Celje in the 15th century had a good deal of autonomy and it is evident that many also read Slovene. The 16th century was a great turning point in Slovene history. In 1573 a vast peasant rebellion uniting Slovenes and Kajkavian Croats was put down with brute force. The Habsburg authorities suppressed the Slovene Reformation, which had led to the production of a vernacular Bible in 1584. Like Croatia, Slovenia became the frontier of Christendom in the 16th century, experiencing frequent Turkish incursions. There was a reduction in Slovene-language publication from the 17th century, but it experienced a rapid revival in the 19th century.</p>
          <p>
      The first recognizably modern history of the Slovenes was produced in 1791 and the first Slovene newspaper was published in 1797. During the Napoleonic Wars (1803-15), the Slovene lands were incorporated into the Illyrian Provinces (1809-13) and vernacular publication was encouraged. Reincorporation into the Habsburg lands in 1815 meant that the Slovenes were gradually influenced by Central European cultural nationalism. A standardized Slovene grammar was published in 1808 and the poet France Prešeren (1800-49) produced some of the greatest work in the language, including the national anthem, 
      <i>Zdravljica</i>
      . In economic life Janez Bleiweis founded an agricultural society in 1843, which was to evolve into the Slovenska Ljudska Stranka (Slovene People’s Party) in 1905. By 1848, with the outbreak of revolutions across the Habsburg monarchy, some Slovenes were to demand a `United Slovenia’.
    </p>
          <p>After the reorganization of the state as a `dual monarchy’ in 1867, to accommodate Hungarian demands, Slovenes became increasingly involved in a `trialist’ solution to the monarchy’s problems, which would recognize the Slavs as the third great element in the state alongside the Hungarians and Austrians. South Slav political solutions became increasingly attractive to the Slovenes in the years immediately preceding the First World War, although many had misgivings as to whether ethnic groups with such different historical experience as the Serbs and Slovenes would be able to live comfortably in a single state. An earthquake destroyed much of the old city of Ljubljana (Laibach) in 1895 and its subsequent reconstruction led to a national revival. The Slovene lands were a significant theatre of war during 1915-18 and many Slovenes died fighting for the Habsburg monarchy. One of the most significant battles of 1917 was fought at Caporetto (now Kobarid), which later became a significant focus for peace dialogues between European nations. Slovene commitment to Yugoslavism increased, particularly with the formation of home-rule national councils in mid-1918. The defection of the Slovenes, particularly the influential cleric Anton Korošec, had helped to bring down the Habsburg dynasty in October. In November 1918 former Habsburg officer Rudolf Maister organized volunteer forces of over 4,000 and thus secured the Styrian city of Maribor (Marburg) for an emerging South Slavic state. The Slovenes then rapidly formed part of a new state ruled by the Karađorđević dynasty, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, established in December.</p>

          <heading>The Slovenes and the Two Yugoslavias</heading>
          <p>The formation of the new kingdom (formally renamed Yugoslavia in 1929) divided the Slovenes as a nation for virtually the first time in history. Slovenes living in the Klagenfurt basin decided to remain within Austria, after a plebiscite in October 1920, although this was difficult to achieve in some areas. The Italians had been promised Slovene ethnic territory in the Treaty of London (United Kingdom) of 1915 (the punitive terms of which had helped to cement the Yugoslav orientation of Slovene politics) and, under the terms of the Treaty of Rapallo in November 1920, Italy gained the Adriatic littoral, the town of Gorizia (Gorica) and a section of the Julian Alps. Italy and Austria then embarked on programmes intended to eradicate the Slovene language and culture. Under the Italian fascist leader, Benito Mussolini, Slavs were obliged to italianize their names, and many intellectuals were moved to other parts of Italy to accelerate assimilation. (Notably, the persecution of the Slovene minority under fascism was a subject covered by novelist Boris Pahor, 1913-2022, who was also a frequent commentator on Slovene culture and politics.) The city of Ljubljana succeeded Klagenfurt (now in Austria, and known in Slovene as Celovec) and Trieste (now in Italy) as the central point of Slovene culture.</p>
          <p>The state ruled by the Karađorđević dynasty, which was considered by many of its subjects to be Serb-dominated, was beset with national problems from its inception, although many Slovenes participated willingly, particularly the Slovene leader, Korošec, who became Prime Minister. The liberal Vidovdan Constitution of 1921 was suspended in 1929 when King Aleksandar (Alexander) began to rule as a dictator, until his assassination in 1934 by Croatian and Macedonian nationalists. A weak regency succeeded Aleksandar, and by 1939 Yugoslavia was disintegrating, with some Slovenes demanding the same autonomies for their province of Dravska that Croatia had gained in the so-called Sporazum (Mutual Understanding) of the same year.</p>
          <p>Yugoslavia collapsed in April 1941, when German and Italian forces invaded and its Government fled to London. Slovene Styria and a part of Carniola were annexed to the German Third Reich, while control of the south, including Ljubljana, went to the Italians. A Liberation Front, composed of liberals, Christian socialists and communists (including Edvard Kardelj, who, after the war ended, would become the most influential figure in the inner circle of the Yugoslav leader Josip Broz—Tito), was established to oppose the occupation. Nationalists formed the so-called Domobranci (Home Defence) and frequently collaborated with the occupying forces against the combined left. Nevertheless, the divisions in Slovene politics were never quite as extreme as elsewhere in continental Europe. The Liberation Front joined forces with the Yugoslav partisans, led by Tito, and by 1945 expelled the remaining Germans, who had taken over from the Italians after the latter’s collapse in 1943. These combined forces also liberated Trieste in May 1945.</p>
          <p>The victorious remade Yugoslavia as a federal state of national republics. They duly proclaimed a Socialist Republic of Slovenia in January 1946 and added a small Adriatic littoral, consisting principally of the towns of Koper (Capodistria), Izola (Isola) and Piran (Pirano), to the territory, although this area historically had only a small Slovene population. Italians and Germans fled the new state and their homes were taken by the local Slavs, a process that made Slovenia remarkably ethnically homogeneous by Central European standards. Many of those considered to be Nazi collaborators were detained and killed in the weeks after the end of the war. In 2010 a mass grave of about 700 people shot without trial by the communists was discovered in Prevalje, near the Austrian border. Similar mass graves of soldiers and civilians have been found across Slovenia since 1991, when the issue became more openly discussed. Although the Yugoslavs had wished to retain Trieste, they were overruled by the Soviet leader, Stalin (Iosif Dzhugashvili), and the Western Allies, who insisted that the status of the city be resolved by the creation by the United Nations (UN) Security Council of the Free Territory of Trieste, in 1947. The city was then partitioned into zones A and B. Only the latter zone, which contained certain suburbs but no economically important features, was retained by Yugoslavia.</p>
          <p>The loss of Trieste (confirmed in 1954) with its Slovene-speaking proletariat was an incalculable economic and cultural blow for the fledgling republic. However, the existence of Slovene communities outside the communist republic ensured that there was a free flow of ideas from the West, as well as flourishing illicit trade. From 1948 Kardelj set about reshaping the ideological bases of Yugoslav socialism, including economic decentralization (which, his critics stated, favoured Slovenia) and an international policy of careful `neutrality’ through the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). Nevertheless, the second Yugoslavia, like the first, was beset by nationalist disputes, which began to emerge in the 1960s. Inter-republican tensions erupted in mid-1969, when the Slovenes protested to the central Government over the redirection of funds lent by the World Bank to rebuild the Karawanken tunnel (linking Slovenia with Austria). In 1974 a new federal Constitution was introduced, intended further to devolve power by giving more authority to the republics, which held the theoretical right to secede from the Federation.</p>

          <heading>The Disintegration of Yugoslavia, 1980-91</heading>
          <p>
      The deaths in Ljubljana of Kardelj in 1979 and of Tito in May 1980 marked the end of an era in Slovenian politics. Tito was not replaced by a strong leader to unite all Yugoslavs, and nationalism, in Slovenia as in the other federal republics, began to emerge as a response to this power vacuum. In 1981 the journal 
      <i>Nova revija</i>
       (New Review) was founded, the editors of which were clearly inspired by the Polish Solidarity movement. In 1987 it published an edition that discussed the perceived negative position of the Slovenes within Yugoslavia. Publications such as the youth journals 
      <i>Mladina</i>
       and 
      <i>Katedra</i>
       and the independent broadcaster Radio Študent encouraged intellectuals and artists to explore previously forbidden ideas and concepts, including the idea of an independent Slovenia. The Slovenes also began to create closer ties with their non-communist neighbours through organizations such as Alpe-Adria (which included Austrian and Italian participation). Within Yugoslavia, Slovenia defended the civil liberties of Kosovo Albanians (in the Serbian province of Kosovo) who lived under martial law after riots in 1981. In 1989 the election as President of the Presidency of Serbia of Slobodan Milošević, who was willing to use extreme Serb nationalism to legitimize his own position (also as President of Serbia in 1991-97) unleashed a dangerous factor into Yugoslav politics. For Milošević and his supporters, freedom of expression in Slovenia was anathema; from the mid-1980s the republic was provoked with economic boycotts and with threats of rallies.
    </p>
          <p>On 27 September 1989 a majority in the Slovenian Assembly adopted a constitutional amendment asserting republican sovereignty. On 13 December the newly formed Demokratična Opozicija Slovenije (DEMOS—Democratic Opposition of Slovenia) coalition announced its alternative political programme, which included Slovenian economic sovereignty, the suspension of federal legislation, the introduction of a temporary Slovenian monetary unit and a commitment to a plebiscite on independence. In January 1990 the entire Slovenian delegation withdrew from an emergency congress of the Savez Komunista Jugoslavije (SKJ—League of Communists of Yugoslavia). The Zveza Komunistov Slovenije (League of Communists of Slovenia) officially left the SKJ in the following month, having renamed itself the Stranka Demokraticne Prenove (SDP—Party of Democratic Reform), and arranged democratic elections. Although DEMOS won an overall majority in the multi-party polls held in April, with 126 of the 240 contested seats, the SDP candidate, Milan Kučan, defeated the DEMOS candidate, Jože Pučnik, in a presidential election. Lojze Peterle, of the Slovenski Krščanski Demokrati (SKD—Slovenian Christian Democrats), became Prime Minister. On 2 July the Državni Zbor (National Assembly) declared Slovenia to be an independent state, without explicitly addressing the issue of secession. From that time Slovenian laws took precedence over federal laws. In September Slovenia refused to accept the authority of the Federal Constitution, on the grounds that Kosovo Albanians had effectively been excluded from the Federal Assembly.</p>
          <p>The question of Slovenian involvement in the Yugoslav People’s Army (JNA), which had played a notable role in the republic’s politics in the late 1980s, when several journalists, including future Minister of Defence (and later Prime Minister) Janez Janša, had been arrested and charged with disclosing military secrets, emerged again in 1990. In February Slovenia withdrew its units from Kosovo and announced its intention to exercise control over both its own frontier posts and the JNA units within the republic. In July the JNA seized territorial defence weapons, including most of Slovenia’s heavy artillery, and ignored an ultimatum issued for their return. When the JNA refused to allow Slovenian conscripts to carry out their military service solely in Slovenia, the republican Government suspended military payments. Following a crisis in 1988, when the communist authorities had effectively protected citizens against the JNA, the Government, including Janša, had reorganized its territorial forces into a republican army. In October 1990 the JNA forcibly took control of the republican army’s headquarters in Ljubljana, which led Slovenia to accelerate its plans. In the same month Croatia and Slovenia proposed a restructuring of Yugoslavia into an alliance of sovereign states, which would control their own foreign policies, with only a consultative parliament remaining in the Serbian and Yugoslav capital, Belgrade. The Slovenian Government then organized a plebiscite on independence. Of the 93.5% of the electorate who voted on 26 December, 88.5% supported full independence. Over the next six months the Slovenian Government made the necessary arrangements to finalize the transfer of power from federal to republican bodies. In January 1991 Croatia and Slovenia signed mutual defence agreements, and in March conscription to the JNA was suspended.</p>

          <heading>After Independence</heading>
          <p>On 25 June 1991 Slovenia and Croatia declared full independence from Yugoslavia and ordered their territorial forces to take control of the borders of their respective republics. The JNA initially restricted its troop movements to the seizure of international borders on 27-28 June, but an impasse was reached when Slovenia refused to countenance a ceasefire until the JNA had returned to barracks. Over the following week there was aerial bombardment of Brnik Airport (now Ljubljana Jože Pučnik Airport), ambushes, blockades of military bases and mass desertions from the JNA. Official figures stated that 79 people were killed. The Slovenian Government also waged a diplomatic campaign, which effectively secured Slovenian independence and a non-military defeat of Yugoslav forces.</p>
          <p>On 28 June 1991 the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, representing the European Community (EC, now the European Union—EU), initiated negotiations for a ceasefire between the federal authorities, the JNA and the Slovenian Government. This included a three-month suspension of Slovenian independence and a return to barracks by JNA troops. By 5 July Slovenia had demobilized 10,000 men and the EC had imposed an arms embargo on Yugoslavia. Further plans, agreed on 7 July, allowed an unarmed EC mission to monitor the ceasefire and gave control of the international borders to the Slovenian police. JNA troops were to be withdrawn from Slovenia by 25 October. On 7 October Slovenia issued its own currency, the tolar. In December a new republican Constitution was adopted, based upon the principle of the division of power between the judiciary, executive and legislature. The 90-member National Assembly was to be elected for a four-year term and a directly elected President for five years. On 15 January 1992 the countries of the EC officially recognized Slovenian independence, followed by the USA in April. Slovenia was admitted to the UN in May.</p>
          <p>On 6 December 1992 Slovenia held its first post-independence parliamentary and presidential elections. Kučan was confirmed in the largely ceremonial post of President, winning 63.9% of the votes cast. He remained President until late 2002, serving two full terms of office, being elected to a second term in 1997. Despite the fact that presidential powers were limited, Kučan was considered to have a stabilizing influence on politics, although Janša suggested that he used his party `networks’ even after 1991. It was significant that Slovenia managed to avoid excessive recriminations about its communist past, and individuals associated with the old regime were not isolated from the mainstream as they were, for example, in the Czech Republic. This led to some criticism of Kučan from elements within the Catholic Church and from non-communist politicians, who would have appreciated, in particular, a more robust repudiation of the period in the aftermath of the Second World War, when Tito’s Partisans killed thousands of their opponents. The 1992 parliamentary elections failed to secure a majority for any party. Janez Drnovšek, an economist and a former member of the Yugoslav presidium, who had taken over from Peterle in May, formed a coalition Government in January 1993, comprising his own party, the Liberalno Demokratska Stranka (Liberal Democratic Party—which later merged with three other parties to form the Liberalna Demokracija Slovenije—LDS—Liberal Democracy of Slovenia), the SKD, the Združena Lista (United List—an alliance including some former communists, later renamed the Združena Lista Socialnih Demokratov—ZLSD—United List of Social Democrats), and the Socialdemokratska Stranka Slovenije (SDSS—Social Democratic Party of Slovenia).</p>
          <p>Commentators have often noted the importance of personalities in Slovenian politics; in part, this is probably due to the small size of the political elite. Although individuals also change roles with relative frequency, the political system is fundamentally quite stable. Since independence, environmental and human rights causes have been central to Slovenian politics and their national identity. The Zeleni Slovenije (Greens of Slovenia) party, established in 1989, initially performed well in elections, although its success has dwindled in recent years.</p>
          <p>The first coalition Government was characterized by ill-tempered infighting, partly because of the volatile personality and influence of Janša. In July 1993, as Minister of Defence and leader of the SDSS, he was implicated in an arms-trading scandal. Following his dismissal from the Government in March 1994, Janša withdrew his party from the coalition. Peterle resigned as Minister of Foreign Affairs in September, in protest at what he believed was disproportionate LDS representation in the Government. Peterle was replaced by Zoran Thaler, another LDS member. In April 1998 the SDSS alleged that Drnovšek had violated the Constitution by signing a secret security agreement with Israel in 1995. Janša’s proposal that Drnovšek be impeached was rejected by the National Assembly in June 1998 and indirectly led to Janša’s own resignation as head of Slovenia’s delegation to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in the same month.</p>
          <p>In 1994 Italy stated that until Slovenia agreed to compensate Italian nationals who had fled from Istria after the Second World War and had thereby lost their property, it would obstruct Slovenian efforts to join the EU. This action delayed scheduled accession negotiations, and it was not until May 1996 that Slovenia and Italy reached a compromise agreement. Slovenia was to amend its Constitution to allow EU nationals to purchase property within four years of its Association Agreement with the EU being ratified; EU citizens who had previously been resident in Slovenia for three years would be allowed to purchase property immediately. Although this excluded the Italian nationals, it was seen by some politicians as a betrayal of Slovenian national interests and the SKD approved a motion of no confidence in Thaler. Drnovšek, angered by the attempt to destabilize his Government, dissolved the coalition, although he subsequently reversed this decision and retained Thaler as acting Minister of Foreign Affairs. Thaler resigned from this post in July 1997, following opposition claims that Slovenia’s accession to the EU would be on less favourable terms than those for other states (his negotiated agreement on accession had been ratified by the National Assembly in the same month).</p>
          <p>In legislative elections held on 10 November 1996, the LDS increased its legislative representation to 25 deputies and, following the formation of a coalition with the ZLSD, the Demokratična Stranka Upokojencev Slovenije (DeSUS—Democratic Party of Pensioners of Slovenia), the Slovenska Nacionalna Stranka (SNS—Slovenian National Party), and the Italian and Hungarian minorities’ parties, could rely on the support of 45 deputies. However, an electoral alliance comprising the Slovenska Ljudska Stranka (SLS—Slovenian People’s Party), the SKD and the SDSS also obtained 45 seats. President Kučan proposed that Drnovšek continue as premier; however, it was not until January 1997 that he was re-elected by the National Assembly, after an SDSS deputy had become an independent. Finally, in February the SLS agreed to join a government coalition with the LDS and DeSUS.</p>
          <p>In March 2000, in an attempt to broaden the appeal of the centre-right parties, the SLS and the SKD announced that they were to merge in the following month, at which time the nine SLS ministers would withdraw from the governing coalition. In April Drnovšek, who no longer commanded a parliamentary majority, nominated eight independents to replace the departing ministers. However, the National Assembly failed to endorse his proposed new Government, and the premier was forced to resign. Following their merger, the SLS and the SKD nominated Andrej Bajuk as a candidate for the premiership; he was confirmed as Prime Minister in May. His interim coalition administration, which included Peterle as Minister of Foreign Affairs and Janša as Minister of Defence, governed until the legislative elections held on 15 October.</p>
          <p>The 2000 elections were a rejection of Bajuk’s style of government and political orientation, in particular his special relationship with the Catholic Church and tendency to appoint close associates to principal posts. Drnovšek’s LDS increased its share of the votes, obtaining 36.3% and 34 seats. The ZLSD obtained 12.1% of the votes, while Janša’s SDSS took 15.8% (slightly less than in 1996). However, the real loser in the elections was Bajuk’s Nova Slovenija—Krščanska Ljudska Stranka (N.Si—New Slovenia—Christian People’s Party), which included former members of the SLS, with just 8.6% of the votes. The reconstituted SLS (as it was again known) secured 9.6%, compared with a combined total of 29.0% for the SLS and the SKD in 1996. In December 2000 Drnovšek formed a coalition Government comprising the LDS, the ZLSD, the SLS and DeSUS.</p>

          <heading>Slovenia Joins the EU and NATO</heading>
          <p>Kučan was succeeded as President in late 2002 by Drnovšek, a pivotal figure in the success of Slovenian independence, who defeated an independent supported by the SDSS and N.Si, Barbara Berziger, after two rounds of popular voting. Following the appointment of Anton Rop of the LDS as premier in mid-December, most of the principal posts in the Government remained unchanged. In July 2004 Rop appointed Ivo Vajgl as Minister of Foreign Affairs, replacing Dimitrij Rupel (who returned to the post in December). Also in July the ZLSD leader, Borut Pahor, became a member of the European Parliament.</p>
          <p>After being diagnosed with cancer, Drnovšek became more reclusive, supporting diverse human rights causes and founding a social organization, the Gibanje za Pravičnost in Razvoj (Movement for Justice and Development). He left office at the end of 2007, and died in February 2008. His successor was an independent, Danilo Türk, who conclusively defeated his more right-wing challenger, Peterle, in the second round of voting. A former dean and law professor at the University of Ljubljana, Türk held widespread appeal for leftist and centrist voters, and was credited with some of Slovenia’s early diplomatic successes at the time of the country’s international recognition in 1992.</p>
          <p>By the time of the elections to the National Assembly in October 2004 the political climate had changed. Slovenia’s recent accession to NATO and the EU meant that the question of Slovenia’s relationship with those organizations was no longer a major election issue. The Slovenska Demokratska Stranka (SDS—Slovenian Democratic Party—as Janša’s SDSS had been renamed in 2003) campaigned successfully in favour of lowering taxes and increasing privatization, in accordance with EU recommendations. The elections had the lowest rate of participation of any held since independence, an indication perhaps that the electorate had become disenchanted with some of the major political figures. The ZLSD obtained 10 seats (compared with the 11 seats that it had held in the outgoing National Assembly), having retained support in certain urban strongholds. Drnovšek’s LDS lost 13 of the 36 seats previously held, winning only 22.8% of the popular vote. Significant gains were made by the SDS, which obtained 29.1% of the votes, more than any other party. Janša was able to form a coalition Government composed of the SDS, N.Si (which had obtained nine seats), DeSUS (four seats) and the SLS (seven seats). By mid-2006 Janša’s Government was considered to have moved increasingly to the right.</p>
          <p>At the elections to the National Assembly held on 21 September 2008, the SDS obtained 29.3% of the votes, compared with the 30.5% obtained by the Socialni Demokrati (SD—Social Democrats—as the ZLSD had been renamed); the latter party thereby increased its parliamentary representation substantially, from 10 to 29 seats, while that of the SDS decreased marginally, from 29 to 28 seats. As in all previous post-independence elections, no single party won sufficient votes to govern outright (even DEMOS had been a coalition), and a coalition Government was formed by the SD, the LDS (which had obtained five seats) and Zares—Nova Politika (Zares—For Real—New Politics), a party recently formed by a breakaway group from the LDS, which had secured nine seats. DeSUS obtained seven seats, the SNS five, and the SLS five. Pahor of the SD became Prime Minister, defeating Janša, who had been embroiled in a scandal earlier in the month, after a broadcast on Finnish television had alleged that he had received bribes from the Finnish state-owned company Patria in association with a tender to supply military vehicles. As a former communist who had maintained some links on the left, Pahor’s assumption of the premiership represented a break with Janša’s political agenda. Rupel was appointed as a Special Envoy for Foreign Affairs. Samuel Žbogar, who had served as a senior diplomat under the Drnovšek Government and was considered to be sympathetic to the humanitarian concerns of the former Prime Minister and President, was also included in Pahor’s cabinet, being assigned the foreign affairs portfolio.</p>
          <p>By early 2011 Pahor’s `consensus’ approach to government had become more unpopular, in part owing to the quantity of national referendums that had been conducted: on proposed media legislation in December 2010; on proposed part-time employment legislation in April 2011; while in June 2011 three referendums were held simultaneously, the most significant of them concerning a proposed increase in the retirement age, which was rejected. In September the Government lost a parliamentary motion of confidence, which was connected to a vote on required economic austerity measures. Consequent early elections to the National Assembly in December brought a new, centre-left political party, Pozitivna Slovenija (PS—Positive Slovenia), led by Zoran Janković, to prominence. Janković was already well known as the Mayor of Ljubljana and director of the Mercator retail chain. He mobilized considerable support in the capital with promises of greater economic responsibility and improvements in conditions, relying heavily on his personal charisma. Although PS won 28.5% of the votes cast and 28 seats, Janković was unable to form a stable governing coalition.</p>
          <p>At the end of January 2012 Janša, whose SDS had secured 26.2% of the votes and 26 seats, formed a broad coalition, after negotiating an agreement with the SLS, DeSUS and the newly established, liberal Državljanska Lista Gregorja Viranta (Gregor Virant’s Civic List). Janša resumed his former role as Prime Minister in the following month. However, Slovenian politics had been dominated by a few experienced or charismatic individuals since the late 1980s, and Janša’s return to power was not wholly unexpected, despite his party’s loss of support. His predecessor, Pahor, was rejected by the electorate, following the challenge of PS, and the SD lost a total of 19 parliamentary seats, winning only 10. At the second round of the next presidential election, which took place on 2 December 2012, Türk was defeated by Pahor, who received 67.4% of the votes. Pahor had in June been defeated in a contest for leadership of the SD by Igor Lukšič, which had left him free to campaign for the presidency. As President, Pahor’s style was described as populist and celebrity-driven, and he was known by the nickname `Barbie’, owing to his past work as a model and his account on the social networking service Instagram.</p>

          <heading>Support for Populism and a New Green Movement</heading>
          <p>Meanwhile, Janša was ousted in a parliamentary vote of no confidence in February 2013, after an investigation into corruption allegations relating to his dealings with Patria. He was found guilty in June, and began a two-year prison sentence in June 2014, when 3,000 supporters rallied outside. Much as he had done in 1988, Janša claimed that the charges against him were politically motivated; he was released in December 2014 and his conviction was overturned in 2015. His successor, Alenka Bratušek, was not only the first female Prime Minister in Slovenia, but also the first to have been born as recently as the 1970s. However, a loss of support from within her own party, PS, led to Bratušek’s resignation in May 2014, causing pre-term elections to be scheduled for July, some 18 months early. Although the left had been predominant in Slovenian political life since independence, the increasingly fractious nature of politics favoured the centre-right in the short term and the populist right in the longer term. In May Bratušek became leader of her own group, the Zavezništvo Alenke Bratušek (ZAB—Alliance of Alenka Bratušek), after Janković defeated her in a contest to become leader of the PS in April.</p>
          <p>In the event, the legislative elections, held on 13 July 2014, were won by a party formed only weeks earlier, the Stranka Mira Cerarja (SMC—Party of Miro Cerar), which was named after its leader, a prominent law professor, and which had campaigned on a programme that included reducing the country’s budget deficit. The new party obtained 36 of the 90 seats in the National Assembly. Notably, PS, the largest party in the outgoing legislature, failed to obtain representation, while the ZAB won just four seats. Cerar became Prime Minister, leading a coalition Government comprising the SMC, the SD and the DeSUS, which between them held 52 seats; Cerar’s own party was subsequently renamed the Stranka Modernega Centra (SMC—Party of the Modern Centre), and the ZAB as Stranka Alenke Bratušek (SAB—Party Alenka Bratušek). Meanwhile, Janša gathered some powerful allies abroad, notably the Hungarian Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, who had led an anti-immigration, populist political agenda in his own country since 2010, and remained outspoken about topics such as the refugee and migration crisis in the Mediterranean.</p>
          <p>On 12 November 2017 Pahor was elected for a second (and, under the terms of the Constitution, his last) term as President, with 53.1% of the votes cast in the second round, defeating the Major of Kamnik and satirist, Marjan Šarec, but with a historically low voter turnout, of 42.1%. </p>
          <p>On 14 March 2018 the Supreme Court annulled the results of a referendum that had endorsed a controversial railway construction project, on the grounds that public funds had been used to finance the government campaign in its support. Prime Minister Cerar immediately announced his resignation, and on 14 April President Pahor dissolved the National Assembly and brought forward parliamentary elections to 3 June.</p>
          <p>In June 2018 Janša’s SDS won 24.9% of the votes cast, securing 25 of the 90 seats in the National Assembly. Second-placed was an anti-corruption party led by Šarec, the Lista Marjana Sarča (LMŠ—List of Marjan Šarec), which obtained 12.6% of the votes and 13 seats. The SD took 9.9% of the votes and 10 seats, Cerar’s SMC 9.8% and 10 seats, the newly reconstituted Levica (The Left) alliance 9.3% and nine seats, N.Si 7.2% and seven seats, Bratušek’s SAB 5.1% and five seats, and DeSUS 4.9% and five seats. The inconclusive nature of the elections, providing no party with an overall majority, made the formation of a coalition inevitable. Pahor subsequently invited Janša to form a new government. However, a political impasse ensued, after Janša’s efforts to negotiate a new ruling coalition proved unsuccessful. LMŠ leader Šarec subsequently reached an agreement with the SD, the SMC, the SAB and DeSUS on the formation of a minority government, which was also supported by Levica. The National Assembly voted to designate Šarec as Prime Minister on 17 August, and the new coalition agreement was officially signed on 29 August. The country’s first minority Government, which held 43 seats in the National Assembly, received parliamentary approval on 13 September.</p>
          <p>On 27 January 2020 Šarec resigned as Prime Minister and urged early elections, after he was unable to hold together his minority coalition and secure the approval of essential health sector reforms. President Pahor nominated Janša to succeed him on 26 February, and a new, SDS-led coalition Government, also comprising the SMC, N.Si and DeSUS, which held a narrow parliamentary majority, took office following parliamentary approval on 13 March. This was Janša’s third term as Prime Minister and he was quickly congratulated by international allies such as Orbán. His Government planned to reintroduce military conscription, which had been phased out in 2003, and to secure the country’s border with Croatia in order to reduce the influx of migrants. President Pahor made a special address to the National Assembly in June, urging electoral reform (in accordance with a 2018 ruling by the Constitutional Court) in order to avert the need for further minority governments in the future. Meanwhile, the first cases of COVID-19 in the country, amid the escalating pandemic, coincided with Janša’s assumption of office and his Government imposed a strict testing and containment strategy. A campaign of protests held in Ljubljana and other major cities began in late April 2020 over the restrictions on personal freedoms, which were perceived as a political manoeuvre by the Government. A mass rally was staged in Ljubljana on 28 May 2021 to demand the resignation of Janša’s Government (which had continued to lose support) and early elections. Around 7,100 deaths due to COVID-19 had been recorded in Slovenia by June 2023. By that time some 61% of the population had been vaccinated.</p>
          <p>Upon the 30th anniversary of Slovenian independence in June 2021, Prime Minister Janša presented the years since 1991 as a triumph of democracy and pluralism against the one-party system imposed by Tito. Paradoxically, Janša’s Government drew widespread criticism for its promotion of intolerant nationalism in the cultural and education sectors (including the termination of employment contracts for supporters of opposition groups). In April 2021 Janša was forced to deny reports that he planned to use Slovenia’s forthcoming Presidency of the EU Council to open discussions (via an informal paper presented to President of the European Council Charles Michel) on the reorganization of borders within the Balkan region, including territorial exchanges between Kosovo and Serbia, as well as the possible dissolution of Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
          <p>
      Legislative elections on 24 April 2022 resulted in the removal from office of the Janša-led Government, perhaps as a result of his unpopular alliances abroad. The new Government created after the elections was led by Robert Golob, the former CEO of state-owned power company GEN Energija. His centre-left party, the Gibanje Svoboda (GS—Freedom Movement), previously the Stranka Zelenih Dejanj (Green Actions Party), won 34.5% of the votes cast and 41 seats. Janša’s SDS won 23.5% of the vote, only slightly less than its result in 2018, and 27 seats. The remaining votes were split between the smaller parties, with only N.Si, the SD and Levica returning representatives to parliament. The GS then formed a new coalition Government with the SD and Levica, in which former Prime Minister Šarec received the post of Minister of Defence, and Tanja Fajon, the leader of the SD and hitherto a Member of the European Parliament, became Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs. Golob issued pledges that his Government, which was approved by the National Assembly at the beginning of June
      
       2022, would deliver environmentally friendly policies, combined with enhanced social security and greater levels of personal freedom. Golob has been compared to former Prime Minister Drnovšek, and his Government has been regarded as a renaissance for non-populist, progressive politics.
    </p>
          <p>In May 2022 a court in Celje upheld a three-month suspended prison sentence imposed on Janša (who had been dubbed `Marshall Tweeto’ due to his nationalist voice on social media network Twitter) for defamation against two journalists on the social media platform in 2016. On 13 November 2022 an independent candidate, Nataša Pirc Musar, was elected as Slovenia’s fifth President with 53.9% of the votes cast in the second round. She defeated a longstanding ally of Janša, former Minister of Foreign Affairs Anže Logar. A centre-left lawyer, who had previously led the Slovenian Red Cross, championed freedom of speech and written several academic books on data protection, Musar became the first woman to be elected to the presidency. Musar’s candidacy had the broad support of Golob’s Government, as well as of former Presidents Kučan and Türk.</p>

          <heading>Foreign Relations and Cultural Change</heading>
          <p>After independence Slovenia sought closer integration into the international community, particularly the EU and NATO. In May 1993 Slovenia joined the Council of Europe and participated in NATO’s Partnership for Peace programme. Slovenian troops formed part of the NATO-led Stabilization Force (SFOR) in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1996-98 and were deployed in Albania in 1997. They also formed part of the NATO-Russian peacekeeping force, KFOR, deployed in Kosovo after 1999. Nevertheless, Slovenia’s application to be included in the first round of NATO enlargement was rejected in 1997. As Prime Minister, Drnovšek regarded NATO membership as a principal policy objective and argued that Slovenia’s long-term interests lay with the alliance. In 1999 US President Bill Clinton visited Slovenia, as in June 2001 did his successor, George&#160;W. Bush (to participate in a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin). These visits consolidated already good Slovenian-US relations. Drnovšek successfully pursued a policy of promoting Slovenia as a `bridge’ between Eastern and Western nations: at a NATO summit held in Prague, Czech Republic, in November 2002, he took a special interest in development issues, and in 2006 he offered to act as a mediator in the conflict in the Darfur region of Sudan. President Putin visited Slovenia in July 2016 to attend a commemoration ceremony at a Russian memorial on the Vršič Pass in north-western Slovenia, which marked the 100th anniversary of several hundred Russian soldiers dying as prisoners of war in an avalanche there.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, Pahor, after becoming Prime Minister in November 2008, concentrated his initial diplomatic efforts on European countries, visiting Belgrade (Serbia), Bratislava (Slovakia) and London; in March 2009 he made an official visit to Germany, meeting Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin. Following his election as President in December 2012, Pahor again visited Berlin in April 2013. Janša, who concentrated on maintaining good relations with both the USA and the Russian Federation while he was Prime Minister, was heavily involved in debates about the future of the single European currency, the euro, in 2012 (amid the ongoing debt crisis in the eurozone), regaining a reputation for moderation as a result.</p>
          <p>
      At the time of independence, Slovenia’s politicians expressed the hope that their country would enjoy closer relations with Western European institutions and countries. In 1998 Slovenia began its Strategy for Accession to the European Union. By early 2002 it had harmonized most of its laws with the EU 
      <i>acquis communautaire</i>
       (the body of EU legislation, treaties and case law). In April there was a public outcry over the planned sale of shares in the state-owned banks Nova Ljubljanska Banka and Nova Kreditna Banka Maribor to foreign owners (in accordance with EU recommendations), indicating that some popular resentment about the implementation of EU norms remained. Also in April former Prime Minister Peterle was elected to represent candidate countries at the presidency of the Convention on the Future of the EU in Brussels, Belgium, seemingly in acknowledgement of his crucial role in negotiations with the EC in 1991-92. In 2002 Slovenia was invited to become a full member of the EU, moving away from its associate member status with the signature of the Treaty of Accession in Athens, Greece, in April 2003. The Slovenian public had voted in favour of both NATO and EU membership at a referendum on 23 March. Of the votes cast, 89.6% supported accession to the EU, while only 66.1% endorsed membership of NATO. Slovenia was also formally invited to join NATO, and was duly admitted to the Alliance in March 2004. On 1 May Slovenia, together with nine other countries, formally joined the EU.
    </p>
          <p>During 2005, in a further indication of its integration into international organizations, Slovenia chaired the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). In January 2007 Slovenia became the 13th EU member state to adopt the euro, abolishing the Slovenian tolar, which had been a short-lived but important symbol of independence. Former Prime Minister Bajuk was allocated the finance portfolio in the Janša Government to promote these changes. As elsewhere in the EU, there was widespread suspicion that the change in currency had led to covert price rises, although prices in both currencies remained on display for comparison until the end of June. Slovenia held the rotating Presidency of the EU Council for a period of six months from January 2008, and assumed the role again in the second half of 2021. In May 2010 Slovenia was invited to join the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).</p>
          <p>Relations with Austria were somewhat strained in the 1990s. The Slovenian press has been consistently critical of nationalism in Austria, particularly as expressed by the Governor of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, prior to his death in 2008, against the background of a concerted attack on the civil rights of the Slovene minority in Austria. Slovenia was also unwilling to endorse the claim made in some Austrian quarters that it had a minority of Slovenes of German origin, or that it might owe compensation to ethnic Germans who had lost their properties in 1945, as a result of the so-called AVNOJ (Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia) resolutions, which sought to expel ethnic Germans from communist-controlled Yugoslavia.</p>
          <p>Although it was anticipated that the Slovenian property market would be of interest to those Italian nationals who lost land after 1945, EU accession actually led to other Europeans investing in property in the country, a trend that has been accelerated by Slovenia’s membership of the eurozone. Ljubljana has experienced a rapid expansion of its property market, after its citizens were cushioned from the effects of the housing market for years, particularly those who received privileges under communism. Unlike many of the former communist states of Central and South-Eastern Europe, Slovenia has experienced net immigration since joining the EU.</p>
          <p>Relations with Croatia have been problematic since independence. Ownership of the nuclear plant at Krško, in south-eastern Slovenia, was divided between the two countries in 1995, but in July 1998 Slovenia temporarily disconnected power lines to Croatia, after the latter refused to pay for its energy supply. In November both sides agreed to resolve the Krško dispute on the basis of co-ownership, which has remained rather troubled in practice. (In June 2022 the International Atomic Energy Agency commended the Krško plant in a report on radioactive waste management.) Although the Governments of both countries were united in their opposition to the autonomy of Istria (which peninsula is shared between Croatia, with the larger part, and Slovenia) and keen to retain the terms of the 1975 Treaty of Osimo (delineating the Yugoslav-Italian border), Slovenia and Croatia could not always agree where their mutual borders should lie. Resolution of a dispute over the Bay of Piran region and the control of access to and management of the Adriatic waters proved to be among the most intractable political issues in foreign relations. After January 2000, with the installation of a new Croatian Government, bilateral relations improved temporarily; however, an agreement resolving the outstanding issues of contention between Slovenia and Croatia, signed in July 2001 by President Drnovšek and Croatian Prime Minister Ivica Račan, remained unratified by the Croatian legislature.</p>
          <p>In July 2009 Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader resigned, following Slovenia’s veto of Croatia’s EU accession and incipient allegations of corruption against him. Concerns about press freedom in Croatia and other legacies from the past encouraged some other EU countries to support the Slovenian case. Following discussions between Prime Minister Pahor and his new Croatian counterpart Jadranka Kosor, it was finally agreed that the border dispute should be resolved by international arbitrators. In September a Slovenian parliamentary committee on EU affairs voted in favour of ending its veto on Croatia’s accession in the Council of the EU, and an agreement on legally binding international arbitration was signed by Slovenia and Croatia in November. The Slovenian National Assembly ratified the settlement in April 2010, and subsequently approved a proposal that it be endorsed by a national referendum. At the referendum, which was conducted on 6 June, the public voted in favour of the Government’s initiative, but, as it received the support of 51.5% of voters, only by a narrow margin. The SDS, led by Janša, had opposed the agreement, accusing the Government of being weakened by its desire to seek international approval, and had used the campaign slogan `They have taken Carinthia, Trieste and Gorizia—they will not take the sea!’ to remind Slovenes that territory liberated by the partisans had been lost once before, in 1945, owing to international pressure; after the referendum, the party stated that Slovenia had effectively lost its access to the sea, although the inhabitants of the coastal towns had overwhelmingly supported the proposal of arbitration in the referendum. Croatia welcomed the decision, as it removed the impediment to its EU accession and improved bilateral relations with its neighbours. In June 2011 the European Commission formally recommended that Croatia’s accession negotiations be concluded, and Croatia joined the EU on 1 July 2013.</p>
          <p>Following the 2010 referendum in Slovenia, the continuing border dispute was referred to the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague, Netherlands, where proceedings finally began in 2012. In July 2015 Croatia withdrew from the process, following media reports of unauthorized contact between the Slovenian judge at the Court and the Slovenian government representative; however, at the end of June 2016 the PCA announced the resumption of work on the issue. In 2016 Italy abandoned plans to build liquefied natural gas terminals in the Gulf of Trieste (in the Adriatic Sea), after years of opposition from Slovenia, which had submitted a petition to the European Commission in 2013, and from environmental groups in both Italy and Slovenia. In June 2017 the PCA issued a ruling on the border between Slovenia and Croatia, including the disputed village of Hotiza on the Mura river, which awarded a `corridor’ of some 10 nautical miles, together with around 75% of the Bay of Piran, to Slovenia. Nevertheless, the bilateral dispute continued, as Croatia refused to abide by the Court’s decision. After the European Commission declared its neutrality, in July 2018 Slovenia brought an action over Croatia’s refusal to abide by the PCA’s ruling at the European Court of Justice. However, on 31 January 2020 the Court issued a decision that the dispute was outside its jurisdiction, urging both sides to resolve their differences.</p>
          <p>Slovenian politicians generally supported NATO’s aerial bombardment of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (comprising Serbia and Montenegro) in 1999 and participated in the UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). After the fall of Milošević, following the Yugoslav presidential election of September 2000, Slovenia established diplomatic and economic relations with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (and its successor, the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro) and regarded it as a potential ally. Relations with Montenegro, which declared its independence from the State Union in June 2006, also improved considerably. Slovenia was one of the first nations to send congratulations to Montenegro on its independence, ahead of the EU, and was also among the first states to establish an embassy in the Montenegrin capital, Podgorica. Slovenia rapidly extended recognition to Kosovo following its declaration of independence from Serbia in February 2008 and established an embassy in Prishtina, the capital of Kosovo, in April, becoming one of the largest investors in the Kosovo economy. However, Serbia was strongly opposed to independence for Kosovo, and several countries, including Bosnia and Herzegovina, Romania and Greece, refused to recognize the new state, indicating that one of the last remaining regional issues from the Yugoslavian conflagration was far from being settled. In 2012 Janša supported the candidacy of both the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia (FYRM—now North Macedonia) and Serbia for EU membership. During the US Administration of President Donald Trump, Slovenia’s good bilateral relations with the USA were often emphasized due to the Slovenian origins of his wife Melania, who also promoted Slovenian culture. Janša, who initially reported erroneously on Twitter that Trump had been re-elected in the US election in November 2020, is considered by some critics to be a representative of the era of social media-driven populism. A controversial statue of Melania Trump in her hometown of Sevnica was destroyed in July 2020 by arson, having been unveiled a year earlier. US President Joe Biden sent congratulations to President Pahor on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of Slovenian independence in June 2021. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, in mid-March Janša visited the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, where he met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. In a demonstration of strong support, he stated: `Ukraine is a European country, every path in Ukraine is European’. Golob’s Government, which was installed on 1 June, continued to support Zelensky.</p>
          <p>Many Yugoslavs of non-Slovene ethnicity living in Slovenia in 1991 chose to remain and take Slovenian citizenship, even though the 1991 Constitution did not give them the same collective rights as the tiny Hungarian and Italian populations. At a referendum held in April 2004, almost 95% of participants (voter turnout was 31.5%) rejected legislation proposing to restore citizenship rights, rescinded in 1991, of nationals of other former Yugoslav republics. An estimated 6,000 people remaining in Slovenia were `erased’ from the registers of citizens at the time of the fragmentation of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. The failure of the Slovenian Supreme Court to resolve their status has attracted criticism from human rights groups. Some 300,000 customers of the Nova Ljubljanska Banka resident in other former Yugoslav republics were not reimbursed for the funds in their accounts, which had been frozen in 1991. In June 2015, however, the Government approved a plan to return approximately €385m. to former bank customers in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia, which was expected to improve Slovenia’s relations with its neighbours. In 2001 direct railway connections between Hungary and Slovenia were restored. Some 9&#160;km of the Pragersko-Hodoš line on which services linking Trieste, Koper and Rijeka (Croatia) with the Hungarian capital, Budapest, and towns further to the east operate were electrified in 2016; work was completed on the section to coincide with the 25th anniversary of Slovenia’s independence in June of that year. In May 2017 Croatian popular singer Marko Perković, who had featured Second World War fascist themes in his songs, was banned from performing in Maribor, prompting protests by Croatian diplomats.</p>
          <p>As inflows of refugees and other migrants into Europe increased from late 2015, in a regional crisis largely precipitated by conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic, many attempted to travel through Slovenia on a route into Europe that had previously traversed North Macedonia, Serbia and Croatia. The Slovenian authorities constructed a razor-wire fence on the border with Croatia in late 2015 (as the latter was not yet part of the Schengen border-free area). In addition, Austria established a border fence with Slovenia at the small town of Spielfeld to stem the flow of migrants, effectively challenging the Schengen Agreement. Large numbers were obliged to wait for days at Slovenian border crossings, and in March 2016 Prime Minister Cerar announced that stricter border controls would be implemented in an attempt to control the movement of people. Both Croatia and Slovenia imposed an upper limit of 580 migrants per day entering their country. Meanwhile, in mid-March a new EU agreement was reached with Turkey, providing for refugees travelling on to Greece from Turkey to be returned to that country. Despite these measures, the number of illegal migrants increased, and in the first half of 2019 alone more than 5,000 were recorded. In July the Italian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior, Matteo Salvini, suggested the restoration of border controls between Italy and Slovenia, with the construction of a fence. Joint border patrols between the Slovenian and Italian police forces were launched in June 2021, using technology such as drones. Although the new Government headed by Golob sought to lift border restrictions and return to Schengen conditions, the Austrian Federal Minister for European and International Affairs, Alexander Schallenberg, continued to insist, during an official visit to Slovenia in June 2022, that controls be maintained on the Austria-Slovenia border, citing instability caused by the conflict in Ukraine.</p>
          <p>In July 2004 the Supreme Court ruled that it was illegal to hold a referendum on the planned building of a mosque in Ljubljana, which was opposed by some residents. For years, Ljubljana had been one of the very few European capitals with no mosque, although Muslims (mostly of Bosnian descent) represented the second largest religious group in the country and just under 6% of the population in 2002. Work on the Bežigrad district mosque commenced in 2013 and was largely completed by late 2018, following substantial funding from Qatar. The site has already been vandalized by anti-Muslim extremists, and Mufti Nedžad Grabus, the head of the Slovenian Muslim community, expressed his concern about continued hostility towards Muslims. However, there are signs that official attitudes towards Muslims are becoming more liberal.</p>
          <p>At the 2002 census just under 58% of Slovenians declared themselves as Catholics, a decline of about one-third since the Second World War. Although the Catholic Church has remained an important force in Slovenian culture and politics, its influence is felt less strongly than in Croatia or Poland. In May 2023 President Musar met Pope Francis during a visit to the Vatican; their discussions focused on the war in Ukraine, with Musar pledging Slovenia’s continued aid to the country, and she gave the pontiff a replica of an 18th century beehive, viewed as a typically Slovenian artefact.</p>
          <p>Although `Yugo-nostalgia’ is not uncommon in Slovenia, by the early 21st century the country could no longer be meaningfully regarded as part of the Balkans; nevertheless, its economy relies on a substantial number of guest workers from the region, and its culture retains strong ties through music, food and even words in the Slovene language. Membership of the NAM during the Cold War also brought overseas students to Ljubljana. In 2010 Slovenia became the first former communist country in which an African-born mayor was elected; Peter Bossman became Mayor of Piran in 2010, and was re-elected to a second term in 2014.</p>
          <p>During the 1980s and early 1990s politicians from both ends of the political spectrum had promoted being part of the EC as the only long-term option for Slovenia. Despite the slow pace of accession to what by then had become the EU, most Slovenians accepted it as inevitable, although the rate of participation in elections to contest seven seats to the European Parliament on 13 June 2004 was only 28.4%. These first European Parliament elections reflected the widespread apathy in Slovenia towards elements of the EU mandate. In November 2010 President Türk defended the EU in response to public discontent over the financial assistance offered to the ailing economies of other member states, reminding Slovenians of their duty to be `responsible citizens’. In the May 2014 elections to the European Parliament, Igor Šoltes, the grandson of Edvard Kardelj, leading a new left-wing party, Verjamem (I Believe), secured one seat in the Parliament. The SDS elected three of the eight representatives allocated to Slovenia, and the SD only one. Neither the LDS or Zares secured representation in the elections, while N.Si, in alliance with the SLS, returned two representatives and DeSUS one. In the European Parliament elections of May 2019, the SDS, this time in alliance with the SLS, again secured three of the eight seats allocated to Slovenia, while the SD and the LMŠ each obtained two seats, and N.Si only one; Šoltes lost his seat. The participation rate amounted to only 28.9% of the electorate. The next elections to the European Parliament were scheduled to be held in June 2024.</p>
          <p>Slovenia experienced similar economic problems to those encountered elsewhere in the eurozone during the period of financial crisis. There were some public protests and minor riots against rising poverty, especially in Maribor, in late 2012 and early 2013. As premier, Bratušek was widely credited with having safeguarded the economy from the worst of the recession. Upon becoming Prime Minister in September 2014, Cerar pledged to address Slovenia’s budget deficit and to implement new austerity measures. By 2017 the budget deficit had been successfully reduced to less than 1% of gross domestic product (GDP), in conformity with European Commission requirements (stipulating a deficit of no more than 3% of GDP). However, following the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the general government deficit exceeded 3% of GDP from 2021, in part due to the cost of government schemes to protect jobs and services during the pandemic.</p>
