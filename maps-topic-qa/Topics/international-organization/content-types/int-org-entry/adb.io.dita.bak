          <p id="ADB.IO.3">Established in 1964, the Bank began operations in July 1966, with the aim of financing economic and social development in African countries. Non-African countries were admitted to the Bank from 1982. The Bank aims to contribute to development and poverty reduction by mobilizing funds for investment and by providing policy and technical assistance. The Bank and two other institutions, the African Development Fund and the Nigeria Trust Fund, constitute the African Development Bank (AfDB) Group.</p>

               <p id="ADB.IO.65">The African Development Bank Group of development financing institutions uses a unit of account (UA), which at December 2022 was valued at US&#160;$1.33084.</p>
               <p id="ADB.IO.66" usage="edio ass mena">The capital stock of the Bank was at first exclusively open for subscription by African countries, with each member's subscription consisting of an equal number of paid-up and callable shares. In 1978, however, the Governors agreed to open the capital stock of the Bank to subscription by non-regional states on the basis of nine principles aimed at maintaining the African character of the institution. The decision was finally ratified in May 1982, and the participation of non-regional countries became effective on 30 December. It was agreed that African members should still hold two-thirds of the share capital, that all loan operations should be restricted to African members, and that the Bank's President should always be a national of an African state.

In February 2019 the AfDB and AU Commission and partners issued a Continental Nutrition Accountability Scorecard, compiled by the ALN to promote commitments towards ending malnutrition.</p>
               <p>The Bank launched an African Gender Equality Index in May 2015. In March 2016 the Bank and UN Women signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on jointly advancing gender equality in Africa. In May 2016 the AfDB established an Affirmative Finance Action for Women in Africa (AFAWA) initiative, with a view to raising US&#8201;$3,000m. towards reducing the risks incurred by commercial banks and microfinance institutions in financing businesses owned by women in the region. In April 2020 the AfDB Board of Directors endorsed a Gender Equality Trust Fund dedicated to supporting the AFAWA agenda. The Bank funds a continental 50 Million African Women Speak Project (50MAWSP), which aims to address specific challenges confronting women, including female entrepreneurs, in securing access to financial and non-financial services. A 50 Million Women Digital Platform was launched in November 2019. In December a digital skills training platform for young people, Coding for Employment, was launched. In December 2020 the Bank’s Board of Directors initiated a Gender Strategy for 2021-25, based on three pillars: Empowering women through access to finance and markets; Accelerating employability and job creation for women through skills enhancement; and Increasing women's access to social services through infrastructure. An AfDB People Strategy for 2021-26, fostering resilience and diversity, was also introduced in 2020. In 2022 100% of the Bank’s sovereign operations were categorized under its Gender Marker System—a tool for systematizing the mainstreaming of gender in its business processes.</p>
               <p>In April 2020 the Bank initiated a US&#8201;$10,000m. COVID-19 Rapid Response Facility, to support the continental recovery from the impacts of the ongoing public health, social and economic emergency. During 2020 the AfDB Group significantly refocused its lending programme to meet the challenges posed by the pandemic crisis, as a result of which loan approvals declined by 43%, compared with 2019, while disbursements increased by 44%. In February 2022 the Bank’s Board of Directors approved a new Strategy for Quality Health Infrastructure in Africa 2022-30 to support national health systems, including through strengthening health information systems, promoting regional collaboration and harmonizing health policies and regulation.</p>

               <p>In April 2022 the AfDB approved a Knowledge Management Strategy, covering the period 2022-31, which aimed to enhance the Bank’s provision of knowledge required to optimize the outcomes of development strategies.</p>
               <p>An Africa Integrity Fund was established in November 2016, to support member states in combating corruption. The AfDB hosts the African Legal Support Facility, which since 2010 has provided legal advice and technical assistance to African governments negotiating complex commercial transactions.</p>
               <p>The Bank Group, with ECA and UNDP, organizes an annual African Economic Conference (AEC), which aims to foster dialogue and the exchange of knowledge on issues affecting the continent. The 18th AEC was held in November 2023, in Addis Ababa (Ethiopia).</p>
               <p>The Bank provides technical assistance to regional member countries in the form of experts' services, pre-investment feasibility studies and staff training. Much of this assistance is financed through bilateral trust funds contributed by non-African member states. The Bank's African Development Institute provides training and seminars for officials of regional member countries in order to enhance the management of Bank-financed projects and, more broadly, to strengthen national capacities for promoting sustainable development. The Institute also manages an AfDB/Japan Fellowship programme that provides scholarships to African students to pursue further education.</p>

               <p>The Bank hosts the secretariat of an African Financing Partnership, which was established in 2008 to mobilize private sector resources through collaborations with regional development finance institutions. It also hosts the secretariat of the Making Finance Work for Africa Partnership (MFW4A), which aims to support the development of the financial sector in the sub-Saharan region. Through a Migration and Development Initiative Fund, initiated in 2009, the Bank supports the development of financial services for migrant workers, and facilitates channelling remittances towards productive uses in workers’ countries of origin. In 2019 it initiated an Africa Digital Financial Inclusion Facility, which aimed to promote digital financial tools to ensure engagement by a further 332m. Africans (with a particular focus on women) in the formal economy.</p>
               <p>In 2008 the AfDB initiated the African Financial Markets Initiative (AFMI), to support the development of bond markets throughout the continent and to stimulate domestic resource mobilization. In February 2015 an AFMI-Bloomberg African Bond Index was launched. A new Sustainable Bond Framework was introduced in September 2023, supporting the issuance of social, green and sustainability bonds.</p>
