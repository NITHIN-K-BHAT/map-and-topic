               <p>
        During 2020-40 the AMF was pursuing a Strategic Vision 2040, focused on fulfilling its role as the Arab countriesâ€™ closest partner in ensuring stability and economic, financial and monetary development, and laying the monetary foundations for Arab economic integration. The Strategic Vision 2040 framework was to be implemented through four five-year medium-term strategic plans. In 2020-25 the AMF was implementing a strategy focused on consolidating its role as the regionâ€™s single Arab-owned monetary institution and platform for economic, financial and monetary policymaking consultations; enhancing its role as a centre of excellence for knowledge and capacity building; developing lending to support efforts to redress economic and financial imbalances in member states; and strengthening the financial sector (including through the development of bond markets in local currencies, promoting financial inclusion and modern financial technology, assisting the development of the 
        <i>Shari`a</i>
        -compliant finance sector, and promoting financial integration among Arab countries and with other financial blocs).
      </p>
          </p-group>
          <p>From early 2020 the AMF supported member states in combating adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in January 2021 initiated a phase aimed at assisting economic recovery, with a focus on supporting economic, monetary, and financial reforms, resolving emergency balance of payments situations, strengthening the enabling environment for small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs), and promoting financial sustainability and economic diversification.</p>
          <p id="AMF.IO.284">Loans are intended to finance an overall balance of payments deficit and a member may draw up to 75% of its paid-up subscription, in convertible currencies, for this purpose unconditionally (automatic loans). A member may, however, obtain loans in excess of this limit, subject to agreement with the AMF on a programme aimed at reducing its balance of payments deficit (ordinary and extended loans, equivalent to 175% and 250% of its quota, respectively). In addition, a member has the right to borrow up to 100% of paid-up capital under a compensatory loan in order to finance an unexpected deficit in its balance of payments resulting from a decrease in its exports of goods and services or a large increase in its imports of agricultural products following a poor harvest.</p>
          <p id="AMF.IO.285">Automatic and compensatory loans are repayable within three years, while ordinary and extended loans are repayable within five and seven years, respectively. Loans are granted at concessionary and uniform rates of interest that increase with the length of the period of the loan. In 1996 the AMF established the Structural Adjustment Facility, initially providing up to 75% of a member's paid-up subscription and later increased to 175%. In 2009, in order to enhance the flexibility and effectiveness of its lending to meet the needs of member countries affected by the global financial crisis, the Fund determined to extend an access limit of 175% for lending for both the public finance sector and for the financial and banking sector under the Structural Adjustment Facility. A Short Term Liquidity Facility was approved in that year to provide resources to countries with previously strong track records undergoing financial shortages owing to the sharp contraction in international trade and credit. A Trade Reform Facility was initiated in 2007. An Oil Facility was also introduced in that year, but was deemed by a decision of the Fundâ€™s Executive Directors in March 2017 to be no longer in force. In 2016 an SMEs Conducive Environment Support Facility was inaugurated to extend resources of up to 100% of a memberâ€™s paid-up subscription in convertible currencies to support reforms in the SME sector. The first loans under the new Facility were approved in 2018.</p>
          <p>The AMF deploys technical missions to member states to follow up reform programmes supported by the Fundâ€™s resources and to assess new requests for loans.</p>
          <p id="AMF.IO.286">During the period 1978-2022 the AMF extended 199 loans, amounting to AAD&#8201;2,851.8m. In 2022 the Fund approved three loans totalling AAD&#8201;119.6m. (compared with AAD&#8201;147.7m. in 2021), to Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia.</p>
          <p>At the end of December 2022 Somalia, Sudan, the Syrian Arab Republic and Yemen were in arrears to the Fund (collectively totalling AAD&#8201;243.7m.).</p>
          <p>The AMF's technical assistance activities are extended in the form of specialized training of officials or through the deployment of expert support missions. The Fundâ€™s Training and Capacity Building Institute (TCBI) offers courses (62, conducted in a virtual format, in 2022) to officials in the financial, monetary, economic, commercial and statistical sectors of Arab countries. The AMF implements an Arab Statistics Initiative (ArabStat).</p>
          <p>In February 2023, jointly with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the AMF organized the Seventh Arab Fiscal Forum, in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE), on the theme `Fiscal sustainability in the Arab World beyond the COVID-19 pandemic: Challenges and opportunitiesâ€™. The AMF convened the fifth Annual Arab Regional Tax Forum in March 2023, in Abu Dhabi, UAE.</p>
          <p>During 2002-22 the Fund provided AAD 62m. in humanitarian support to the Palestinian people. Some 769 Palestinians were receiving TCBI training at the end of 2022.</p>
          <p id="AMF.IO.300">
      The AMF collaborates with Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (AFESD), the League of Arab States and the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) in writing and publishing a 
      <publ-name>Joint Arab Economic Report</publ-name>
      . The Fund provides the technical secretariat for the Council of Arab Central Banks and Monetary Authoritiesâ€™ Governors, and also serves as the technical secretariat of the Council of Arab Finance Ministers, and for various related task forces and committees.
    </p>
          <p> In 1991 the Council established the Arab Committee on Banking Supervision. In 2005 the Council inaugurated a second technical grouping, the Arab Committee on Payments and Settlements Systems. An Arab Economic Database was initiated December 2014. The AMF actively supports the Financial Inclusion for the Arab Region Initiative (FIARI), which was launched by the Council in September 2017. In February 2020 the AMF launched the Buna Regional Payment Platform, to provide centralized multicurrency clearing and settlement services for financial transactions between Arab states and with their principal external trading partners. It was agreed in April 2021 that the Platform would be hosted by the UAE. A Buna Instant Payment Service was initiated in April 2023.</p>
          <p>The AMF participatesâ€”with the Islamic Development Bank OPEC Fund, Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa, and other partnersâ€”in the Arab Coordination Group (ACG), a strategic alliance that was established in 1975, and aims collectively to optimize resources to advance sustainable development.</p>
          <p>A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was concluded between the AMF and the European Stability Mechanism in March 2022 that provided for a general framework on strengthened collaboration. In April an AMF-African Export-Import Bank MOU was signed, with a view to enhancing economic and financial co-operation.</p>
          <p>
      In May 2022 the AMF published 
      <publ-name>Public Debt in The Arab World: Asymmetric Effects on Economic Growth,</publ-name>
       based on data from 10 Arab countries.
    </p>
          <p>
      In June 2023 the AMFâ€™s 
      <publ-name>Arab Economic Outlook</publ-name>
       envisaged that, collectively, Arab economies would demonstrate growth in 2023 of 3.4%, rising to 4% in 2024.
