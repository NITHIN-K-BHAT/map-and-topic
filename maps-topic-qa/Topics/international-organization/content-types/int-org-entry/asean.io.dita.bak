          <p id="ASEAN.IO.3">ASEAN was established in August 1967 to accelerate economic progress and to increase the stability of the region. At the first ASEAN summit meeting, convened in February 1976, a Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in South-East Asia and a Declaration of ASEAN Concord were adopted. In November 2007 its 10 members signed an ASEAN Charter, which, upon its entry into force in December 2008, formally accorded the grouping the legal status of an intergovernmental organization.</p>

          <p>A new Charter, codifying the principles and purposes of ASEAN and according it the legal status of an intergovernmental organization, was signed in November 2007, and entered into force in December 2008. The occasion was commemorated at a Special ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting (AMM)—which was also the inaug­ural meeting of the new ASEAN Co-ordinating Council. In March 2009 ASEAN heads of state and of government, meeting in Thailand, signed the Cha-am Hua Hin Declaration on the Roadmap for an ASEAN Community (2009-15), comprising Blueprints towards the establishment, by 31 December 2015, of an ASEAN Political-Security Community, the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), and an ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community.</p>
          <!--APSC AEC ASCC -->
          <p>In October 2010 ASEAN leaders adopted a declaration on Bali Concord III (extending previous agreements), promoting a common ASEAN platform on global issues of common interest and concern, based on a shared global view.</p>
          <p>Heads of state and of government attending the 27th ASEAN summit, held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in November 2015, welcomed the formal establishment of an ASEAN Community. The meeting adopted the ASEAN Community Vision 2025, a Kuala Lumpur Declaration on ASEAN Community Vision 2025, as well as `Blueprint 2025’ documents relating to the Political-Security Community, the AEC and the Socio-Cultural Community, all of which constituted the initiative of ASEAN 2025: Forging Ahead Together. In late March-early April 2022 the inaugural meeting was held of a High-Level Task Force tasked with developing an ASEAN Community Post-2025 Vision. Concord IV was adopted by the 43rd summit meeting, held in Jakarta, Indonesia, in September 2023.</p>
          <p usage="edio fea">In June 2020 the 36th ASEAN summit adopted the Ha Noi Plan of Action on Strengthening ASEAN Economic Cooperation and Supply Chain Connectivity in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. An ASEAN Comprehensive Recovery Framework was approved by the 37th summit, in November, along with an Implementation Plan. An ASEAN Travel Corridor Arrangement Framework was also initiated between member states. In March 2021 the 27th ASEAN Economic Ministers’ Retreat (held in a virtual format) endorsed 13 priority deliverable actions that focused on regional recovery, digitalization, and sustainability. Later in that month an ASEAN Partnership Conference was convened, themed `Towards Post-COVID Recovery and Resilience in ASEAN’. In March 2022 ASEAN ministers responsible for economic affairs extended certain exceptional measures under the Ha Noi Plan of Action until 13 November 2024.</p>

               <heading>Situation in Myanmar</heading>
               <p>In March 2021 an Informal AMM, held in a virtual format, issued a statement which included comment on the situation in Myanmar, following the reinstatement of military leadership in that country in the previous month. In the context of ongoing popular protests at the coup and violent retaliation by the military authorities, ASEAN urged all parties to refrain from instigating further violence and to work towards reconciliation. An extraordinary summit of ASEAN heads of state and of government, held in late April, agreed a Five-Point Consensus (5PC) on the situation in Myanmar, which called for an immediate cessation of violence there, and the exercise of utmost constraint by all parties; the initiation of constructive dialogue aimed at achieving a peaceful solution to the crisis; the appointment of a Special Envoy of the ASEAN Chairmanship to facilitate the dialogue process (with the assistance of the ASEAN Secretary-General); the provision of humanitarian assistance to Myanmar; and for the Special Envoy and other delegates to visit Myanmar to meet all relevant stakeholders. In mid-October a special meeting of ASEAN ministers responsible for foreign affairs decided that a non-political representative of Myanmar would henceforth be invited to participate in ASEAN meetings, owing to the failure of Myanmar’s military regime to enter into construction engagement with the Special Envoy and 5PC. A 15-point statement agreed by ASEAN heads of state in November 2022 aimed to prompt constructive dialogue with the (still un-co-operative) Myanma leadership. In January 2023 an Office of the ASEAN Special Envoy to Myanmar was established, tasked with co-ordinating regular contact with a broad spectrum of Myanma stakeholders. In September the 43rd summit agreed to establish an informal troika consultation mechanism, comprising the holders of the current, previous and incoming ASEAN Chairmanships, to address the Myanmar situation. It was also decided at that time that the Philippines would assume the ASEAN Chairmanship in 2026, in place of Myanmar, and that the policy of excluding the Myanma leadership from summits of heads of state and meetings of ministers responsible for foreign affairs (replaced by non-political representation) was to continue. Leaders participating in the 43rd summit urged the engagement of all Myanma stakeholders in the ongoing 5PC process. A meeting of ministers of foreign affairs, convened in January 2024, was attended by a Myanma official. The Laos Chairmanship of ASEAN in 2024 suggested it would seek greater engagement with the authorities in Myanmar and promote the provision of humanitarian assistance, consistent with the 5PC.</p>

                    <p id="ASEAN.IO.24">An agreement to create an ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) by 2008 was signed by heads of state and of government in January 1992. In accordance with the agreement, a common effective preferential tariff (CEPT) scheme came into effect in January 1993, covering all manufactured products, including capital goods and processed agricultural products (which together accounted for two-thirds of intra-ASEAN trade). In September 1994 ASEAN ministers responsible for economic affairs agreed to accelerate the implementation of AFTA, advancing the deadline for its entry into operation to 1 January 2003. Viet Nam was admitted as a member of ASEAN in July 1995 and was granted until 2006 to implement the AFTA trade agreements. Lao PDR and Myanmar became members of ASEAN in July 1997 and were granted a 10-year period, from 1 January 1998, to comply with the AFTA schedule. In December 1998 ASEAN leaders advanced the AFTA deadline, for the original six members, to 2002. In April 1999 Cambodia, on being admitted as a full member of ASEAN, signed an agreement to implement the tariff reduction programme over a 10-year period, com­mencing on 1 January 2000. In November 2000 a protocol was approved permitting further temporary exclusion of products from the CEPT scheme for countries that were experiencing economic difficulties.</p>
                    <p>On 1 January 2002 AFTA was formally realized among the original six signatories (Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand). By 1 January 2005 tariffs on just under 99% of products on the 2005 CEPT inclusion list had been reduced to the required 0%-5% range among the original signatory countries, with the average tariff standing at 1.93%. With regard to Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Viet Nam, some 81% of products fell within the 0%-5% range. On 1 August 2008 comprehensive revised CEPT rules of origin came into effect. In September 2021, in the context of combating the COVID-19 pandemic, 107 new tariff lines (agricultural and food products) were listed under AFTA as essential goods, in addition to 152 tariff lines already listed, to facilitate their free flow through the region. The list of essential goods was expanded further in March 2022.</p>
                    <p>To complement AFTA in facilitating intra-ASEAN trade, member countries committed to the removal of non-tariff barriers, the harmonization of standards and conformance measures, and the simplification and harmonization of customs procedures. A legal framework for regional co-operation, designed to simplify and harmonize customs procedures, legislation and product classification was signed in March 1997 at the inaugural meeting of ASEAN ministers responsible for finance. (Lao PDR and Myanmar signed the customs agreement in July and Cambodia assented to it in April 1999.) In 2001 ASEAN finalized its system of harmonized tariff nomenclature, implementation of which commenced in the following year. In November the summit meeting determined to extend ASEAN tariff preferences to ASEAN's newer members from January 2002, under the ASEAN Integration System of Preferences (AISP). In April 2002 ASEAN ministers responsible for economic affairs signed an agreement to facilitate intraregional trade in electrical and electronic equipment by providing for the mutual recognition of standards.</p>

          In December 1995 ASEAN ministers responsible for trade adopted the ASEAN Framework Agreement on Services (AFAS), providing for enhanced co-operation in services among member states. A protocol finalizing the 10th (and last) package of commitments to the liberalization of services under the AFAS was signed in August 2018. Additionally, since 2005, several mutual recognition arrangements have been adopted, enabling the qualifications of professional services suppliers to be recognized in other member states.

                    <p>In November 2004 ASEAN heads of state adopted an ASEAN Framework Agreement for Integration of the Priority Sectors and its Protocols. Import duties (on 85% of products) were to be eliminated by 2007 for the original members and by 2012 for newer member states in 11 sectors, accounting for more than 50% of intra-ASEAN trade in 2003. A Blueprint and Strategic Schedule for realizing the AEC by 2015 was also endorsed by the 2004 summit meeting. In May 2010 an ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA) entered into force, which aimed to consolidate all trade commitments and tariff liberalization schedules. In March 2022 ASEAN ministers responsible for economic affairs launched a process to upgrade ATIGA, with a view to enhancing ASEAN’s competitiveness as a production base, investment hub and single market. An ASEAN Agreement on Movement of Natural Persons was adopted in November 2012 and entered into force in June 2016. A follow-on AEC Blueprint 2025, covering the period 2016-25, was endorsed by the 27th ASEAN summit in November 2015. The AEC became operational at that time, as well as an AEC 2025 Monitoring and Evaluation Framework. An ASEAN Strategic Action Plan on Consumer Protection was being implemented during 2016-25. An ASEAN Consumer Empowerment Index, covering consumer awareness, skills, and behaviour, was initiated in 2020. In February 2017 an AEC 2025 Consolidated Strategic Action Plan, complementing the AEC Blueprint 2025, was endorsed by ASEAN economic affairs ministers and by the AEC Council. During 2015 agreement was reached on developing and implementing, on a pilot basis, an ASEAN Single Window (ASW), to facilitate the electronic exchange of customs data in order to enhance trade efficiency and competitiveness between member states. The ASW became operational on 1 January 2018 in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam, and during 2019 in Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and the Philippines.</p>
                    <p>The ASEAN-Chambers of Commerce and Industry (CCI) aims to enhance ASEAN economic and industrial co-operation and the participation in these activities of the private sector. In March 1996 a permanent ASEAN-CCI secretariat became operational at ASEAN headquarters. An ASEAN Business Advisory Council held its inaugural meeting in April 2003. An ASEAN Business-Investment Summit (ASEAN ABIS) has been held annually since 2003; ASEAN ABIS 2023 was organized in September, in Jakarta.

The establishment of an ASEAN SME Regional Development Fund was envisaged. An online ASEAN SME Academy was established in 2016 to provide courses in marketing, branding, finance, trade and technology. In April 2022 a redesigned version of the Academy was launched, with the aim of strengthening the supporting environment for the region’s business recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. As at January 2024 courses were being conducted through the Academy in the areas of finance and accounting, technology, management, operations, marketing, and trade and logistics.</p>
                    <p usage="edio">In March 2020 ASEAN ministers responsible for economic affairs agreed a collective response to mitigate the economic impacts of the COVID-19 emergency.

                    <p>An ASEAN Comprehensive Investment Agreement (ACIA) entered into force in March 2012, superseding a previous Framework Agreement on an ASEAN Investment Area (1998) and the ASEAN Investment Guarantee Agreement (1987). In August 2014 ASEAN ministers responsible for economic affairs signed a protocol to the ACIA that aimed to facilitate modification by member states of their investment reservations under the ACIA schedule. In April 2016, meeting in Vientiane (Lao PDR), ASEAN finance ministers and governors of central banks endorsed the creation of an ASEAN Insurance Forum.</p>
                    <p>In December 1997 the first meeting was convened of leaders of ASEAN countries, the People’s Republic of China, Japan and the Republic of Korea (South Korea) to discuss the financial difficulties being experienced in the region at that time. That grouping, referred to as ASEAN Plus Three (APT, or ASEAN+3), subsequently became an extensive framework for regional co-operation. In May 2001 APT ministers responsible for finance formally approved the so-called Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization (CMIM) on currency swap arrangements—an enhanced currency swap mechanism, enabling countries to draw on liquidity support to defend their economies during balance of payments difficulties or speculative currency attacks. An Asian Bond Markets Initiative (ABMI) was launched by APT countries in 2003 to develop local currency denominated bond markets. In February 2009, in the context of the then global economic and financial crisis, APT ministers of finance issued an Action Plan to Restore Economic and Financial Stability of the Asian Region. Ministers agreed to expand the CMIM (from US&#160;$80,000m. to $120,000m.) and to establish an independent regional surveillance unit to strengthen economic monitoring. In May 2010 APT ministers, convened in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, announced the launch, within the ABMI framework, of a Credit Guarantee and Investment Facility, with initial capital of $700m., as a trust fund of the ADB. Ministers also agreed on the establishment of a Singapore-based ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO), to monitor and analyse regional economies and to support the effectiveness of the CMIM. The Office was inaugurated in April 2011. In May 2012 APT ministers of finance and governors of central banks, meeting in Manila, adopted an ABMI New Roadmap+, aimed at enhancing the Bonds Market. They also agreed further to expand the CMIM (to $240,000m.—effected in 2014), and to initiate a crisis prevention mechanism: the CMIM Precautionary Line (CMIM-PL), in addition to an existing CMIM Stability Facility (CMIM-SF) that was available for crisis resolution. A revised agreement on the CMIM, which entered into effect on 31 March 2021, enhanced consistency between CMIM and IMF arrangements, and strengthened co-ordination between the AMRO and the Fund.</p>
                    <p>In September 2011 ASEAN and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) signed an agreement to establish the Malaysia-based ASEAN Infrastructure Fund (AIF), which was to channel finance to support regional infrastructure development and the Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity. The AIF was launched in April 2012; by 1 January 2024 co-financing had been approved under the AIF for 15 projects—including in June 2023 a contribution of US&#8201;$10m. towards an initiative to develop a modern public bus transport network in Davao City (Philippines). In April 2019—within the framework of an AIF Green and Inclusive Infrastructure Window—ASEAN, the ADB and other financiers initiated an ASEAN Catalytic Green Finance Facility (ACGF), which provides loans and technical assistance in support of green infrastructure projects, for example in the areas of clean energy, resilient water systems and sustainable transport. By early 2024 access to $1,800m. in co-financing and technical assistance funds had been made available under the ACGF. An AIF Inclusive Finance Facility was also introduced in April 2019, to provide concessional financing towards critical infrastructure projects in Cambodia, Lao PDR and Myanmar.</p>

A second Special ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on the Rise of Radicalization and Violent Extremism (SAMMRRVE) was convened in September 2017 (the first having been held in October 2015). A Plan of Action to Prevent and Counter the Rise of Radicalization and Violent Extremism during 2018-25 was adopted by the 12th AMMTC, convened in Nay Pyi Taw, Myanmar, in October 2018. The seventh annual ASEAN Ministerial Conference on Cybersecurity was convened in October 2022. An ASEAN Cybersecurity Strategy that was being implemented during 2021-25 had the following five pillars: Advancing cyber readiness co-operation; Strengthening regional cyber policy co-ordination; Enhancing trust in cyberspace; Regional capacity building; and International co-operation. In May 2023 the 42nd ASEAN summit issued an ASEAN Leaders’ Declaration on Combating Trafficking in Persons Caused by the Abuse of Technology.</p>
                    <p>In November 2002 ASEAN and China’s ministers responsible for foreign affairs adopted a Declaration on the Conduct (DOC) of Parties in the South China Sea, agreeing to promote a peaceful environment and durable solutions for the area, to resolve territorial disputes by peaceful means, to refrain from undertaking activities that would aggravate existing tensions (such as settling unpopulated islands, reefs, shoals and cays), and to initiate a regular dialogue of defence officials. Guidelines on the Implementation of the DOC were agreed by senior officials from ASEAN and China in July 2011. During April-May 2012 tensions escalated significantly between the Philip­pines and China concerning territorial rights in the Scarborough Shoal (a reef area claimed by China, the Philippines and Taiwan). In July ASEAN ministers responsible for foreign affairs issued a Statement on the Six-Point Principles in the South China Sea, reaffirming member states’ commitment to the full implementation of the DOC; the 2011 Guidelines for the Implementation of the DOC; the early conclusion of a legally binding Code of Conduct (COC); full respect for universally recognized principles of international law, with particular reference to the 1982 United Nations (UN) Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS); the continued exercise by all parties of self-restraint; and the peaceful resolution of disputes, in accordance with universally recognized principles of international law. Formal high-level consultations between ASEAN and China aimed at finalizing the COC were initiated in September 2013. In July 2016 (in which month the Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled that China’s territorial demarcation in the South China Sea was unlawful) the ministers responsible for foreign affairs of ASEAN and China issued a statement on the Full and Effective Implementation of the DOC of Parties in the South China Sea. The heads of state of ASEAN member states and China issued a joint statement in September on the application in the South China Sea of the Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea (a non-binding initiative agreed by 21 states participating in the Western Pacific Naval Symposium, held in Qingdao, China, in April 2014, with a view to reducing tension between militaries at sea). The application of the Code was tested during an ASEAN-China Maritime Exercise that was undertaken in October 2018, off Zhanjiang, southern China. In April 2020 Viet Nam protested against an incident in which a Chinese coastguard ship sank a Vietnamese fishing vessel in disputed waters near the Paracel Islands. In mid-April a Chinese geological survey ship was deployed to Viet Nam’s maritime exclusive economic zone, and, soon afterwards, significantly escalating tensions, China announced that it had established administrative control over the Paracel and nearby Spratly Islands. In June, during the 36th summit meeting, ASEAN leaders emphasized that UNCLOS should constitute the reference point for determining jurisdiction, sovereign rights and entitlements over maritime zones. By that time it was reported that in recent years China had developed seven disputed reefs into military-protected bases. Negotiations on the formulation of the long-awaited COC were resumed in January 2022, following a pause (attributed to the COVID-19 situation) during 2020-21. In February 2023 officials from Indonesia (the holder in that year of the rotating ASEAN Chairmanship) and China reported that negotiations on the COC would be intensified during that year. The 38th session of the negotiations process was held in March. The initiation of joint maritime patrols by the Philippines coastguard and Australia—to counter China’s continuing assertive maritime presence—was agreed in September 2023.</p>

In April 2018 ASEAN foreign affairs ministers welcomed an inter-Korean summit recently held between President Kim Jong Un of North Korea and his South Korean counterpart, Moon Jae-In (the third such meeting ever to have taken place). Likewise, in June they welcomed the conclusion of the first of a series of US-North Korea summit meetings. Further inter-Korean summits were held in May and in September.</p>

                    <p id="ASEAN.IO.46">In July 1993 the meeting of ASEAN ministers responsible for foreign affairs sanctioned the establishment of the ARF to discuss and promote co-operation on security issues within the region. The first formal meeting of the Forum—comprising member states, ASEAN’s dialogue partners and invited states—was held in July 1994, and it was subsequently convened on an annual basis. The 1995 meeting, held in Brunei Darussalam, in August, attempted to define a framework for the future of the Forum. It was perceived as evolving through three stages: the promotion of confidence building (including disaster relief and peacekeeping activities); the development of preventive diplomacy; and the elabo­ration of approaches to conflict. The third ARF, convened in July 1996, agreed a set of criteria and guiding principles for the future expansion of the grouping. The eighth ARF, meeting in July 2001, agreed to enable the ARF Chair to issue statements on behalf of ARF participants and to organize events during the year. An administrative unit supporting the ARF was established within the ASEAN Secretariat in June 2004. The first ARF Security Policy Conference, held in November, in Beijing, recommended developing various aspects of bilateral and multilateral co-operation, including with regard to non-traditional security threats. Timor-Leste joined the Forum in 2005 and signed the ASEAN Treaty on Amity and Cooperation in South-East Asia (TAC) in January 2007. The 14th ARF, held in Manila, in July, approved the establishment of a `Friends of the Chair' mechanism, comprising three ministers, to promote preventive diplomacy and to respond rapidly to political crises. In July 2008 North Korea acceded to the TAC. A Hanoi Plan of Action (HPOA) to Implement the ARF Vision Statement, adopted in May 2010, aimed to evolve the Forum beyond the confidence-building stage, into a more action-oriented entity. The USA acceded to the TAC in July 2009, Canada and Türkiye (Turkey) in July 2010, and the EU in July 2012. In July 2012 the 19th Forum, meeting in Phnom Penh, failed to agree a concluding statement, following the inability of participating ministers responsible for foreign affairs to establish a common position concerning the formulation of a draft Code of Conduct in the South China Sea. The 20th Forum, convened in July 2013, noted the Statement on the Six-Point Principles in the South China Sea that was concluded by ASEAN ministers in July 2012 following the 19th Forum, and agreed to strengthen preventive diplomacy training in the region. The 27th ARF, held in September 2020, in a virtual format, adopted an HPOA II, covering the period 2020-25, which focused on seven areas of co-operation: disaster relief; counter-terrorism and transnational crime; maritime security; non-proliferation and disarmament; ICT security; defence co-operation; and peacekeeping operations. The 28th ARF, held in August 2021, also virtually, welcomed the recent appointment of an ASEAN Special Envoy to Myanmar. At the time of the 29th ARF, convened in August 2022, Denmark, Greece, the Netherlands, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates acceded to the TAC; Ukraine acceded to the Treaty in November, and Saudi Arabia in July 2023. The 30th ARF, organized in July 2023, in Jakarta, recognized the transboundary and cross-cutting nature of regional security challenges, and the importance of cross-pillar, cross-sectoral co-ordination between ARF participants; enhanced information-sharing with other ASEAN-led mechanisms was urged.</p>

               <p>In October 2010 the first so-called ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting (ADMM)-Plus was held, in Hanoi, incorporating ASEAN ministers and their counterparts from eight dialogue partner (`Plus’) countries, i.e. Australia, China, India, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, Russia and the USA. The new body aimed to complement the work of the ARF. The first ADMM-Plus Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief/Military Medicine Exercise was conducted in June 2013, in Brunei Darussalam. From 2017 it was agreed to hold ADMM-Plus meetings on an annual basis. In 2024 the ADMM-Plus format was focused on seven areas of practical co-operation: maritime security; peacekeeping operations; counter-terrorism; cyber security; military medicine; humanitarian assistance and disaster relief; and humanitarian mine action. An ASEAN Defence Senior Officials’ Meeting (ADSOM)-Plus is also convened annually.</p>

In March 2009 ASEAN heads of state resolved that, in the event of a major disaster in a member state, the Secretary-General would act as the ASEAN Humanitarian Assistance Co-ordinator. An ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster management (AHA Centre) was inaugurated in Jakarta, in March 2012. In April 2015 ASEAN heads of state issued a Declaration on Institutionalising the Resilience of ASEAN and its Communities and Peoples to Disasters and Climate Change, in which they pledged to mainstream climate change adaptation and disaster risk management into policymaking at all levels. The ASEAN Vision 2025 on Disaster Management, finalized in 2016, focused on three strategic areas: further institutionalizing AADMER at national, provincial, city and community level; mobilizing finance and resources towards the implementation of AADMER; and supporting the Agreement through the development of partnerships and innovation. In September 2016 ASEAN leaders issued the ASEAN Declaration on One ASEAN, One Response: ASEAN Responding to Disasters as One in the Region and Outside the Region. In the following month the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Disaster Management adopted an ASEAN Joint Disaster Response Plan, and ASEAN Risk and Vulnerability Assessment Guidelines. The ASEAN High-Level Symposium on Disaster Management 2020, held in February of that year, considered means of enhancing regional strategies on disaster management.

                    <p>Under the terms of a co-operation agreement, signed in 1980 to strengthen trade links and increase co-operation in the scientific and agricultural spheres, a Joint Co-operation Committee meets annually. In 2001 an ASEAN-EU Business Network was established to develop political and commercial contacts between the two sides. The 22nd ASEAN-EU Ministerial Meeting, convened in January 2019, in Brussels, Belgium, determined to intensify bilateral engagement and dialogue, including through the Ministerial Meeting, the ASEAN Post-Ministerial Conference with the EU, ASEAN-EU Trade Commissioner Consultations, the ASEAN-EU Senior Economic Officials’ Meeting, the ASEAN-EU Senior Officials’ Meeting, and the Joint Co-operation Committee. The first EU-ASEAN Experts’ Dialogue on COVID-19 Vaccines was organized in December 2020. A Commemorative Summit to mark 45 years of ASEAN-EU dialogue relations was convened in November 2022, in Brussels.</p>
                    <p>In May 1995 ASEAN and EU senior officials endorsed an initiative to strengthen relations between the two economic regions within the framework of a regular Asia-Europe Meeting of heads of government (ASEM). At the first ASEM, convened in Bangkok, in March 1996, leaders approved an Asia-Europe Partnership for Greater Growth. At the session of the Joint Co-operation Committee held in February 2005, in Jakarta, it was announced that the European Commission’s communication titled `A New Partnership with Southeast Asia’, issued in July 2003, would form the basis for the development of the EU’s relations with ASEAN, along with Bali Concord II and the VAP. Under the new partnership, a Trans-Regional EU-ASEAN Trade Initiative (TREATI) would represent the framework for dialogue on trade and economic issues, whereas the READI (Regional EC ASEAN Dialogue Instrument) would be the focus for non-trade issues. The sixth ASEM, convened in Helsinki, Finland, in September 2006, was attended for the first time by the ASEAN Secretariat, Bulgaria, India, Mongolia, Pakistan and Romania. A Declaration on an Enhanced Partnership was endorsed in March 2007. Australia, New Zealand and Russia acceded to the grouping during the eighth ASEM, held in October 2010, in Brussels. At the ninth ASEM summit, convened in Vientiane, in November 2012, Bangladesh, Norway and Switzerland were admitted into the grouping, bringing the number of member partners to 51 (including the ASEAN Secretariat and the European Commission). In June 2014 an ASEM Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction and Management, held in Manila, adopted a Post-Haiyan Tacloban Declaration, aimed at advancing co-operation in disaster risk reduction, drawing on best practices developed in the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan that struck the Philippines in November 2013. A new ASEAN-EU Strategic Partnership was agreed in principle in January 2019, and implemented from 1 December 2020. Negotiations on an ASEAN-EU Comprehensive Air Transport Agreement were finalized in June 2021. The 13th ASEM summit was hosted by Cambodia, in November.

                    <p>ASEAN-China Dialogue Relations were established in 1991. The first formal consultations between senior officials of the two sides were held in April 1995. In July 1996, in spite of ASEAN's continued concern at China's territorial claims to the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, China was admitted to the PMC as a full dialogue partner. In February 1997 a Joint Co-operation Committee was established to co-ordinate the China-ASEAN dialogue and all aspects of relations between the two sides. Relations were further strengthened by the decision to form a joint business council to promote bilateral trade and investment. Subsequently, China has been a key founding member of the APT process. A Framework Agreement on Comprehensive Economic Co-operation between ASEAN and China entered into force in 2003, and envisaged the establishment of the proposed ASEAN-China Free Trade Area (ACFTA) by 2010 (with the target for the newer member countries being 2015). The Agreement provided for strengthened co-operation in key areas including agriculture, health, information and telecommunications, and human resources development. In October 2003 China acceded to the Treaty on Amity and Co-operation and signed a joint declaration with ASEAN on a Strategic Partnership for Peace and Prosperity, strengthening co-operation in politics, economy, social affairs, security and regional and international issues.

                    <p usage="edio">In June 2019 ASEAN ministers of foreign affairs designated Chile a formal Development Partner, establishing an ASEAN-Chile Development Partnership Committee. The first ASEAN-Chile meeting at the enhanced level was held in February 2020, and addressed areas including maritime co-operation; disaster risk reduction; transnational crime; trade and investment; science, technology and innovation; sustainable development; and education. The second ASEAN-Chile meeting at the enhanced level, held in January 2022, adopted a guidance document on ASEAN-Chile Practical Cooperation Areas to cover 2021-25.</p>
