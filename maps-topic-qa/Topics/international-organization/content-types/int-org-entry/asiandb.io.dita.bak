        A fifth General Capital Increase (GCI V), augmenting the ADB's resources by some 200% to US&#160;$165,000m., was concluded in January 2012. The Bank's ordinary capital resources (which are used for loans to the more advanced developing member countries) were until the end of 2016 held and used entirely separately from its Special Funds resources. In April 2015, however, the Board of Governors and donors to the Bank’s Asian Development Fund (ADF) agreed to merge the ordinary capital resources with the ADF loan portfolio. Accordingly, on 1 January 2017 loans and other assets of $30,812m. were transferred from the ADF, thus tripling the ADB’s equity base, from about $17,500m. to around $48,300m. It was envisaged that the Bank would consequently increase its assistance to developing member countries by up to 50% and to lowest-income countries by 70%, thereby facilitating the fulfilment of the objectives (`Addis Ababa Action Agenda’) of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, convened in July 2015, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and of the UN’s 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-UNDP.001">2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development</xr>

               <p id="ASIANDB.IO.19">The Bank also borrows funds from global capital markets. Total borrowing during 2022 amounted to US $36,109m. At 31 December 2022 total outstanding debt stood at $131,571m.</p>
               <p id="ASIANDB.IO.20" usage="edio fea">In July 1986 the Bank abolished the system of fixed lending rates, under which ordinary operations loans had carried interest rates fixed at the time of loan commitment for the entire life of the loan. Under the present system the lending rate is adjusted every six months, to take into account changing conditions in international financial markets.</p>

          <p id="ASIANDB.IO.223" usage="edio fea sasia eerca">In re­sponding to requests from member governments for loans, the ADB assesses the financial and economic viability of projects and the way in which they fit into the economic framework and development priorities of the country concerned. From 1985 the Bank began to provide direct financial assistance, in the form of equity and loans without government guarantee, to private enter­prises. The currency instability and ensuing financial crises affecting many Asian economies in 1997/98 prompted the Bank to strengthen its activities as a broad-based development institution, rather than solely as a project financier.</p>
          <p>In July 2018 the Board of Directors approved a long-term `Strategy 2030’, aligned with the SDGs, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, and the 2015-30 Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. The Strategy had the following seven operational priorities: (i) reducing continuing poverty and inequalities; (ii) accelerating progress towards gender equality; (iii) addressing climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and improving environmental sustainability; (iv) making cities more liveable; (v) promoting rural development and food security; (vi) strengthening governance and institutional capacity; and (vii) fostering regional co-operation and integration. In support of the implementation of Strategy 2030, the ADB aimed to diversify and expand its private sector operations—including in small island states and in fragile states, and through support for more public-private partnerships (PPPs)—to account for one-third of its operations. The ADB also aimed to match by 2030 every US&#8201;$1 in financing for its private sector operations with $2.50 in long-term co-financing. An ADB operational plan for private sector operations, in the context of Strategy 2030, placed enhanced focus on developing opportunities in the areas of infrastructure, agribusiness, education, and health.</p>
          <p>In March 2020 the ADB announced a US&#8201;$6,500m. rescue package (increased to $20,000m. in mid-April) to support the response of its developing member states to the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. Financial support focused on public health, protecting the vulnerable, and promoting economic resilience. A particular concern was to assist vulnerable micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), businesses in sectors directly impacted by the crisis, and domestic and regional trade.</p>

          , UN agencies, and multilateral development banks, which aimed to promote social inclusion and green growth at national level. The ADB issued its first Green Bond in that year, to support the funding of climate change mitigation and adaptation initiatives. In April 2017, with the Government of Germany, the ADB established an Asia-Pacific Climate Finance Fund. The Bank launched an NDC Advance Platform in December 2018, with a view to supporting the mobilization of finance by member states to implement voluntary commitments on Nationally Determined Contributions made within the framework of the 2015 Paris Agreement. In 2019 the ADB established an Ireland Trust Fund for Building Climate Change and Disaster Resilience in Small Island Developing States, through which US $13.4m. was to be channelled during 2019-24. An Australia Climate Finance Partnership was created in 2020, to which $94.2m. had been contributed by 31 December 2022. The ADB President’s Advisory Group on Climate Change and Sustainable Development, chaired by the Chairperson of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, meets periodically. In July 2017 the Bank adopted a Climate Change Operational Framework, covering the period 2017-30, in order to help developing member countries to reach their climate commitments under the Paris Agreement, the SDGs and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. The Bank aimed to invest, cumulatively, $100,000m. in climate financing by 2030. In May 2023 the Bank launched a new Innovative Finance Facility for Climate in Asia and the Pacific (IF-CAP), which aimed to secure $3,000m. in loan guarantees to accelerate funding for climate projects in the region and to contribute to its 2030 target. The ADB and the Global Environment Facility jointly established a Natural Capital Fund (NCF) in November 2023. This was to support projects in member states that simultaneously restore natural capital and enhance food security. In January 2024 the ADB reported that its climate financing commitments in 2023 had been 46% higher than in 2022.

                    <p>A Blue Pacific Finance Hub, to build ocean and coastal resilience in countries threatened by the impacts of climate change, was launched in November 2022. ADB supports the Asset Regeneration (REGEN) Platform, which promotes green infrastructure in South East Asia.</p>
                    <p>Through its emergency assistance loan programme the ADB provides fast-tracked support to developing member states to counter the impact of disasters, including rebuilding physical infrastructure and other assets, and restoring economic, social and governance activities. The Bank also prioritizes the extension of support to developing member countries for building national resilience to future disasters. In August 2019 the Bank’s Board of Directors approved a Contingent Disaster Financing (CDF) mechanism, which aimed to extend financial support for disaster preparedness and planning in developing member countries as well as accessible funds in the event of a natural disaster.</p>
