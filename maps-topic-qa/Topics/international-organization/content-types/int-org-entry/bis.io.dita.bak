A Financial Stability Institute (FSI) was established in 1998 to support the implementation of global regulatory standards and supervisory practices.</p>
               <p>In July 1998 the BIS inaugurated its first overseas administrative unit, the Representative Office for Asia and the Pacific, which is based in Hong Kong. A Regional Treasury dealing room became operational at the Hong Kong office in October 2000, with the aim of improving access for Asian central banks to BIS financial services during their trading hours. In November 2002 a Representative Office for the Americas was inaugurated in Mexico City, Mexico. A dealing room in that office was opened in May 2020, as part of the Bank’s new medium-term strategy.</p>

          <p id="BIS.IO.9">The BIS is an international financial institution whose role is to promote international monetary and financial co-operation and stability, and to fulfil the function of a `central banks' bank'. Although it has the legal form of a company limited by shares, it is an international organization governed by international law, and enjoys special privileges and immunities in keeping with its role.</p>
          <p>In mid-2019 the Bank formally launched a medium-term strategy, Innovation BIS 2025, which incorporated initiatives to broaden economic analysis and research, to support central banks to respond to and to apply new technologies, to strengthen digital capacities within the organization, and to use new innovations to enhance cyber security. A BIS Innovation Network was initiated in January 2021, comprising six working groups to support the objectives of the Bank’s Innovation Hub. The fourth annual BIS Innovation Summit was to be held in May 2024, in Basel, on the theme `Navigating rapid technological innovation in the financial sector and in central banking’. During 2020-23 the BIS Innovation Hub issued a series of reports that explored the development of central bank digital currencies.</p>

        Until the end of the 2002/03 financial year the Bank's unit of account was the gold franc. An extraordinary general meeting in March 2003 amended the Bank's statutes to redenominate the Bank's share capital in Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), the unit of account of the 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-UN.2193">International Monetary Fund (IMF)</xr>
        , in order to enhance the efficiency and transparency of the Bank's operations. The meeting decided that the nominal value of shares would be rounded down from SDR 5,696 at 31 March 2003 to SDR 5,000, entailing a reduction of 12.2% in the total share capital. The excess of SDR 92.1m. was transferred to the Bank's reserve funds.
      </p>
               <p>The authorized capital of the Bank at 31 March 2023 was SDR&#160;3,000m., divided into 600,000 shares of equal value; SDR&#160;710.2m. was paid up.</p>

               <!--foreign exchange reserves %-->
               <p id="BIS.IO.65">The BIS uses the funds deposited with it partly for lending to central banks. Its credit transactions may take the form of swaps against gold; covered credits secured by means of a pledge of gold or marketable short-term securities; credits against gold or currency deposits of the same amount and for the same duration held with the BIS; unsecured credits in the form of advances or deposits; or standby credits, which in individual instances are backed by guarantees given by member central banks.</p>
               <p id="BIS.IO.67">The BIS also engages in traditional types of investment: funds not required for lending are placed in the market as deposits with commercial banks and purchases of short-term negotiable paper, including Treasury bills. Increasingly, the Bank has developed its own investment services for central banks, including short-term products and longer-term financial instruments.</p>
               <p id="BIS.IO.68">Central banks' monetary reserves often need to be available at short notice, and need to be placed with the BIS at short term, for fixed periods and with clearly defined repayment terms. The BIS has to match its assets to the maturity structure and nature of its commitments, and must therefore conduct its business with special regard to maintaining a high degree of liquidity.</p>
               <p id="BIS.IO.69">The Bank's operations must be in conformity with the monetary policy of the central banks of the countries concerned. It is not permitted to make advances to governments or to open current accounts in their name. Real estate transactions are also excluded.</p>

        Governors of central banks gather every two months for discussions at the BIS to co-ordinate international monetary policy and to promote stability in the international financial markets. The two main meetings are the Global Economy Meeting (comprising the Governors of 30 BIS member central banks in major advanced and emerging market economies accounting for about 80% of global gross domestic product) and the All Governors’ Meeting (comprising the Governors of all member central banks). Furthermore, during the bimonthly consultations the Governors of central banks in small, open economies, and in major emerging market economies, meet to address themes with particular relevance to their economies. The BIS fosters close co-operation with the IMF and the World Bank, and participates as an observer in meetings of the Group of 10 (G10) industrialized nations (see

                    <p>
          The BIS provides the secretariat of the BCBS (established in 1974 by the Governors of central banks of the G10, and comprising in 2024 45 institutions from 28 jurisdictions), and hosts regular meetings of the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS), which oversees the Committee’s work. The BCBS pools information on banking supervisory regulations and surveillance systems, including the supervision of banks' foreign currency business, identifies possible danger areas and proposes measures to safeguard the banks' solvency and liquidity. It considers the conclusions of annual assessments of so-called Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs)—which are required to maintain a higher level of capital than other banks. The BCBS’s full set of 14 standards, known as the Basel Framework, represents a global benchmark for prudential banking regulation, covering: Scope and definitions; Definition of capital; Risk-based capital requirements; Calculation of risk-related asset (RWA) for credit risk; Calculation of RWA for market risk; Calculation of RWA for operational risk; Leverage ratio; Liquidity coverage ratio; Net stable funding ratio; Large exposures; Margin requirements; Supervisory review process; Disclosure requirements; and Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision. In 2010, in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, a reformed capital framework programme, Basel III, was agreed by the GHOS; Basel III was endorsed in November 2010 by a meeting of the 
          <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-OTHERORGS.ECANDFIN.002">Group of 20 (G20)</xr>
           heads of state and of government, and introduced gradually from 1 January 2013. Final Basel III minimum standards were implemented from 1 January 2023, with certain elements to be phased in fully by 1 January 2028. In December 2022 the GHOS endorsed the implementation, from 1 January 2025, of BCBS proposals regarding a capital standard for crypto assets. In October 2023 the BCBS issued a report addressing banking sector turmoil that had arisen in the previous March —when, over a period of 11 days, four distressed banks with combined assets totalling around US&#8201;$900,000m. were shut down, placed into receivership or rescued, followed on 1 May by the failure of a fifth bank (with assets of some $230,000m.). This chain of events was deemed to be the most significant systemwide banking disruption since the 2008 global financial crisis. The BCBS issued a discussion paper in November 2023 on digital fraud and banking. In 2024 the BCBS comprised a Risks and Vulnerabilities Assessment Group; a Supervisory Cooperation Group; a Policy and Standards Group; a Basel Consultative Group; a Task Force on Climate-related Financial Risks; and a Task Force on Evaluations.

A Markets Committee (formerly known as the Committee on Gold and Foreign Exchange) comprises senior officials responsible for market operations in 27 central banks. It meets regularly to consider developments in foreign exchange and related financial markets, possible future trends and short-run implications of events on market functioning. A Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI), comprising representatives of 27 member central banks, promotes the efficiency and safety of payment, clearing and settlement arrangements. The Irving Fisher Committee on Central Bank Statistics, comprising 103 central banks or monetary authorities, addresses monetary and financial stability-related issues, and has operated under the auspices of the BIS since January 2006. The BIS Central Bank Governance Network became operational in 1999 to facilitate the transfer of information on governance. A BIS Central Bank Governance Forum promotes good governance.</p>

               <p>The Bank's Monetary and Economic Department conducts research, particularly into monetary and financial questions; collects and publishes data on securities markets and international banking developments; and administers a Data Portal for central banks. A Central Bank Research Hub, established by the BIS in 2004, promotes and facilitates the dissemination of economic research published by central banks. Statistics on aspects of the global financial system are published regularly, including details on international banking activities, international and domestic securities markets, derivatives, global foreign exchange markets, external debt, and payment and settlement systems. The Bank is a co-sponsor of the Statistical Data and Metadata Exchange initiative, established in June 2002.</p>
               <p>BIS working groups have addressed highly leveraged, or unregulated, institutions, offshore financial centres, short-term capital flows, deposit insurance schemes, measures to promote implementation of international standards, and the establishment of a unified set of global principles of good practice for foreign exchange markets.</p>

               <p id="BIS.IO.76">Throughout its history the BIS has undertaken various duties as Trustee Fiscal Agent or Depository with regard to international loan agreements.</p>
               <p id="BIS.IO.77" usage="edio">In April 1994 the BIS assumed new functions in connection with the rescheduling of Brazil's external debt, which had been agreed by the Brazilian Government in November 1993. In accordance with two collateral pledge agreements, the BIS determined to act in the capacity of Collateral Agent to hold and invest collateral for the benefit of the holders of certain US dollar-denominated bonds, maturing in 15 or 30 years, which have been issued by Brazil under the rescheduling arrangements. The Bank was to act in a similar capacity for Peru, in accordance with external debt agreements concluded in November 1996 and a collateral agreement signed with the BIS in March 1997, and for Côte d'Ivoire, under a restructuring agreement signed in May 1997 and a collateral agreement signed in March 1998. In October 2005 the BIS served in an escrow agent role in a loan with the Central Bank of Nigeria; the arrangement was terminated upon the final release of funds in February 2007.</p>
