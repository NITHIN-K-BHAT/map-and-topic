          <p id="CAN.IO.15" usage="sacac">In May 1989 the previous framework for Andean solidarity, the Grupo Andino (Andean Group), undertook to revitalize the process of Andean integration, by withdrawing measures that obstructed the programme of trade liberalization, and by complying with tariff reductions that had already been agreed upon. In May 1991, in Caracas, Venezuela, a summit meeting of the Group agreed the framework for the establishment of a free trade area on 1 January 1992 (achieved in February 1993) and for an eventual Andean common market.</p>
          <p usage="sacac">In March 1996 heads of state, meeting in Trujillo, Peru, signed the Trujillo Protocol, providing for the establishment of the Andean Community, which was to have greater ambitious economic and political objectives than the Andean Group. In August 1997 the Andean Community was inaugurated, and the Group's Junta was replaced by a new General Secretariat, headed by a Secretary-General with enhanced executive and decision making powers. In January 2003 heads of state, convened in Quirama, Colombia, endorsed a strategic direction for the Andean integration process based on developing the Andean common market, common foreign policy and social agenda, physical integration, and sustainable development. Meeting in Tarija, Bolivia, in June 2007, CAN heads of state determined to intensify the social, political, environmental and cultural dimensions of regional integration.</p>
          <p id="CAN.IO.1214" usage="sacac">
      In April 2006 the President of Venezuela announced his intention to withdraw that country from the Community, with immediate effect, expressing opposition to the bilateral free trade agreements signed by Colombia and Peru with the USA, on the grounds that they would undermine efforts to achieve regional economic integration. The Community countered that Venezuela's commitment to Andean integration had been placed in doubt by its declared allegiance to other regional groupings, in particular the 
      <xr pageref="N" ref="MERCOSUR.IO">Mercado Común del Sur</xr>
       (MERCOSUR—Southern Common Market). In June 2012 Colombia and Peru, together with Chile and Mexico, inaugurated the

      , aimed at furthering economic integration.
    </p>
          <p>In February 2010 the Council of Foreign Ministers approved an Andean Strategic Agenda focused on 12 priority areas: citizen participation; common foreign policy; trade integration and economic complementation, and promotion of production, trade and sustainable consumption; physical integration and border development; social development; environment; tourism; security; culture; co-operation; energy integration and natural resources; and development of the Community’s institutions.</p>
          <p>In August 2022 the Presidential Council issued a declaration in which the Andean leaders renewed their commitment to upholding the Andean integration process and to continuing to promote post-COVID-19 subregional economic and social reactivation. They stated willingness to pursue collective solutions to the adverse impacts on food supply chains of the Russian Federation-Ukraine conflict.</p>

               <p id="CAN.IO.19" usage="sacac">A council for customs affairs met for the first time in January 1982. In December 1984 the member states launched a common currency, the Andean peso, aiming to reduce dependence on the US dollar and to increase regional trade. The new currency was to be supported by special contributions to the Fondo Andino de Reservas (now the Fondo Latinoamericano de Reservas), and was to be `pegged' to the US dollar, taking the form of financial drafts rather than notes and coins.</p>
               <p id="CAN.IO.20">The Caracas Declaration of May 1991 provided for the establishment of an Andean Free Trade Area (AFTA), which entered into effect (excluding Peru) in February 1993. Heads of state also agreed in May 1991 to create a common external tariff (CET), to standardize member countries' trade barriers in their dealings with the rest of the world, and envisaged the eventual creation of an Andean common market. In November 1994 ministers responsible for trade and integration, meeting in Quito, concluded a final agreement on a four-tier structure of external tariffs (although Bolivia was to retain a two-level system). The CET agreement came into effect on 1 February 1995, covering 90% of the region's imports. The process of incorporating Peru into AFTA (agreed in 1997) was completed by January 2006.</p>
               <p id="CAN.IO.22" usage="sacac">In January 2002 Community heads of state agreed to consolidate and improve the free trade zone and apply a new CET. To facilitate this process a common agricultural policy was to be adopted and macroeconomic policies were to be harmonized. In October member governments determined the new tariff levels applicable to 62% of products and agreed the criteria for negotiating levels for the remainder. Implementation of the new CET was, however, postponed. In January 2006 ministers responsible for trade approved a working programme to define the Community’s common tariff policy, which was to incorporate a flexible CET.</p>
               <p>
        In November 2012 CAN ministers responsible for labour—with a view to facilitating workers’ employability in any of the four member states—endorsed the establishment of an Andean Employment Network, which was to match labour supply and demand within member states; approved new regulations aimed at ensuring equal labour conditions in the member states; and also determined to promote the regional mutual labour skills certification mechanism (CERTIANDINA). Social and labour policies in the Community are analysed through an Andean Labour Observatory Pilot Plan implemented under the auspices of the

               <p>In May 2011 the Commission approved the establishment of an Andean Committee on Micro, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (MSMEs). An INTERCOM project that was initiated by the Community in March 2021 aimed to strengthen the exchange of online customs and foreign trade data between member states. An Andean Business Meeting is convened periodically to promote interregional trade (the 12th edition was organized in October 2023, in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia).</p>
               <!--updated Community rules on origin-->
               <p>From the onset of the COVID-19 crisis in early 2020, CAN-wide measures were implemented to facilitate intra-community trade and to maintain value chains, to promote the digitalization and automation of processes (including electronic commerce), to co-ordinate on safety procedures and on minimizing the risk of coronavirus contagion in rural areas, and to provide training for MSME workers on the changed business environment.</p>
               <p>On 1 March 2021, with the aim of safeguarding health and facilitating trade, a Community directive entered into force on the harmonization of legislation governing the quality control and sanitary surveillance, production, storage, importation, and marketing of cosmetic and absorbent personal hygiene products (which include dental, eye, skin and antibacterial products and insect repellents). An Andean Observatory for the Business Transformation of MSMEs was launched in mid-2021 to monitor the digitalization of their processes (modernizing a previous mechanism on MSMEs that had been introduced in 2011). In March 2022 temporary rules were introduced to mitigate international freight costs for member states. At a meeting held in the following month of the Andean Committee of Telecommunications Authorities a new Andean Digital Agenda was presented, based around the following pillars: digital government and digital transformation; infrastructure and connectivity; digital talent; digital economy; and new technologies for sustainable development. In November CAN organized an international seminar on digital markets and free community competition. DigiCAN, an initiative supporting the Andean Digital Agenda, was launched in June 2023.</p>

In March 1991 the Protocol was amended, with the aim of further liberalizing foreign investment and stimulating an inflow of foreign capital and technology. A further directive covered the formation of multinational enterprises to ensure that at least two member countries have a shareholding of 15% or more of the capital, including the country where the enterprise was to be based. These enterprises were entitled to participate in sectors otherwise reserved for national enterprises, subject to the same conditions as national enterprises in terms of taxation and export regulations, and to gain access to the markets of all member countries. In September 1999 Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela signed an accord to facilitate the production and sale of vehicles within the region; the agreement became effective in January 2000.</p>

        In January 2014 CAN adopted a series of measures aimed at combating unlicensed mining in the region, including 
        
        the destruction of machinery and demolition of properties used in that activity. The Andean Committee Against Illegal Mining develops related strategic guidelines and co-operation measures to minimize the potentially destabilizing social and environmental impacts of illegal mining. In January 2024 the Council instructed the Committee to meet promptly to plan a co-ordinated operation against illegal mining. An Andean Observatory in Charge of the Management of Official Information on Mercury was launched in June 2019, to enhance the traceability of that metal and combat its illegal extraction.

               <p>In July 2004 Andean ministers responsible for agriculture approved a Regional Food Security Policy. A Fund for Rural Development and Agricultural Productivity was launched in the following year. In 2013 an Andean Rural Territorial Development Committee was established to advise on the implementation of an Integral Subregional Rural Territorial Development Program. A CAN phytosanitary electronic portal was initiated in September 2016, to provide current information on plant health for importers, exporters, relevant national institutions, and other regional stakeholders. A similar internet-based portal on animal health was launched in January 2017, covering harmonized Andean legislation for the registration, control, sale and use of veterinary products. In March 2020 CAN and the Permanent Veterinary Committee of the Southern Cone (CVP) concluded a framework co-operation agreement aimed at strengthening regional animal health measures and guaranteeing food safety. A new Andean Agricultural Agenda, agreed in February 2021, aimed to advance regional agricultural trade and integration, including by strengthening productivity, competitiveness, demand-oriented business alliances, smooth customs procedures, the harmonization of sanitary and phytosanitary regulations, and the simplification, digitalization and automation of import and export processes. In December 2022 CAN and the CVP issued a joint statement on co-ordinating regional co-operation mechanisms to detect and prevent the spread of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, cases of which had recently emerged in wild and domestic birds in the region. In August 2023 CAN and the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (German Agency for International Cooperation) concluded an agreement aimed at strengthening the Andean banana sector’s resistance to Fusarium Foc R4T plague.</p>

An information system on the Community tourism sector has been developed in support of the regional Andean tourism observatory. Indigenous gastronomic tourism, agrotourism and landscaping were identified at that time as regional tourism assets, in the context of economic recovery from the COVID-19 crisis. An Ad Hoc Tourism Group was established in October 2021 to promote the sector’s revival. In July 2022 a `Caminos Andinos’ (Andean Roads) project was initiated, with the aim of advancing regional integration through tourism development.</p>

In May 2008 heads of state of the Andean Community confirmed that they would continue to negotiate the agreement as a single group; however, in December the EU announced that it was to commence separate free trade agreement negotiations with Colombia and Peru. Bolivia criticized the decision as undermining the Andean integration process. In June 2012 Colombia and Peru concluded a Trade Agreement with the EU; reservations were expressed at that time by the EU concerning progress on human rights and environmental protection in those countries. The Agreement entered into effect, provisionally, with Peru on 1 March 2013 and with Colombia on 1 August.

In December 2003 MERCOSUR and the Andean Community signed an Economic Complementary Agreement providing for free trade provisions, according to which tariffs on 80% of trade between the two groupings were to be phased out by 2014 and tariffs were to be removed from the remaining 20% of, initially protected, products by 2019. The accord did not enter into force in July 2004, as planned, owing to delays in drafting the tariff reduction schedule. In July 2005 the Community granted Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay associate membership of the grouping, as part of efforts to achieve a reciprocal association agreement. Chile was granted observer status in December 2004, and in September 2006 was formally invited to join the Community as an associate member. In December the first meeting of the CAN-Chile Joint Commission was convened in Cochabamba, Bolivia. An agreement on Chile’s full participation in all Community bodies and mechanisms was approved in July 2007. In February 2010 ministers responsible for foreign affairs of the Community and MERCOSUR agreed to establish a CAN-MERCOSUR Mixed Commission to facilitate enhanced co-operation between the countries of the two organizations.

        , in Quito). The fourth Inter-Secretariat Meeting, convened in July 2023, at the headquarters of ALADI, in Montevideo, Uruguay, focused on productive chains.

In May 2023 the Colombian President Gustavo Petro announced that his country would rejoin UNASUR after an absence of five years.
