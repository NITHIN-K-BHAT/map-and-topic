          <p id="CARICOM.IO.5">CARICOM was formed in 1973 by the Treaty of Chaguaramas, as a movement towards unity in the Caribbean; it was to incorporate a Common Market, replacing the Caribbean Free Trade Association, founded in 1965. A revision of the Treaty of Chaguaramas (by means of nine separate Protocols), in order to institute greater regional integration and to establish a CARICOM Single Market and Economy (CSME), was instigated in the 1990s and completed in July 2001. The single market component of the CSME was formally inaugur­ated on 1 January 2006.</p>

          <p>The CARICOM Secretariat Strategic Framework being implemented during 2022-30 had the following objectives: Improved standards of living and work; Full employment of labour and other factors of production; Accelerated, co-ordinated and sustained economic development and convergence; Enhanced levels of economic competitiveness; Expansion of trade and economic relations with third states; Achievement of a greater measure of economic leverage and effectiveness in dealing with third parties; Enhanced co-ordination of member states’ foreign and economic policies; Organization for increased production and productivity; Enhanced functional co-operation.</p>
          <p>A Protocol to Amend the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas to allow Enhanced Cooperation among Member States and to address Related Issues, signed by Barbados, Belize, Dominica, and Grenada at the 33rd inter-sessional meeting, held in March 2022, in Belize, provided for groups of at least three states to pursue—when deemed appropriate by two-thirds of the whole CARICOM membership—streamlined collaboration in areas with targeted goals that would be achieved less promptly in the broader organizational format. Decisions adopted in areas of Enhanced Cooperation (upon entry into force of the Protocol) would only be binding on the specific group of participating states.</p>

               <p id="CARICOM.IO.47" usage="sacac">In 1989 the Conference of Heads of Government agreed to implement, by July 1993, a series of measures to encourage the creation of a single Caribbean market. These included the establishment of a CARICOM Industrial Pro­gramming Scheme; the inauguration of the CARICOM Enterprise Regime; full implementation of the rules of origin and the revised scheme for the harmonization of fiscal incentives; facilitation of travel for CARICOM nationals within the region; free movement of skilled workers; removal of all remaining regional barriers to trade; establishment of a regional system of air and sea transport; and the introduction of a scheme for regional capital movement. In August 1990 CARICOM heads of government mandated the governors of CARICOM members' central banks to begin a study of the means to achieve monetary union within CARICOM; they also institutionalized biannual meetings of CARICOM ministers responsible for finance and senior finance officials.</p>
               <p>The initial deadline of 1991 for the establishment of a common external tariff (CET—first agreed in 1984) was not achieved. At a special meeting, held in October 1992, CARICOM heads of government agreed to reduce the maximum level of tariffs from 45% to between 30% and 35%, to be in effect by mid-1993 (with the level to be lowered further, to 25%-30%, by 1995). The Bahamas, however, was not party to these trading arrangements (since it is a member of the Community but never signed up to the Common Market). At the Heads of Government Conference, held in July 1995 in Guyana, Suriname was admitted as a full member of CARICOM and acceded to the treaty establishing the Common Market. It was granted until 1 January 1996 for implementation of the tariff reductions. The 1995 Conference also approved the free movement of skilled workers from 1 January 1996. (CARICOM nationals entering another member state with a skills certificate issued by the receiving country must be granted indefinite right to remain.) On 31 March 1997 an agreement on the mutual protection and provision of social security benefits entered into force.</p>
               <p>In July 1997 the Conference, meeting in Montego Bay, Jamaica, adopted Protocol II amending the Treaty of Chaguaramas, which constituted a central element of a CARICOM Single Market and Economy (CSME), to provide for the right to establish enterprises, the provision of services and the free movement of capital and labour throughout participating countries. By mid-2001 all member states had signed and declared the provisional application of Protocol II.</p>
               <p>In July 1999 heads of government signed Protocol VI amending the Treaty of Chaguaramas providing for a common transportation policy, with harmon­ized standards and practices, which was to be an integral component of the development of a single market and economy. A Caribbean Aviation Safety and Security Oversight System was established in July 2008. A Multilateral Air Services Agreement (MASA), establishing a single market for air transport services within the Community, entered into force in August 2020. A Caribbean passport, introduced in January 2005, is issued by all countries participating in the CSME. In July 2007 heads of government agreed to introduce a voluntary CARICOM Travel Card, CARIPASS, to facilitate the establishment of a single domestic space. An agreement to implement CARIPASS was signed by heads of government meeting in Dominica, in March 2010.</p>
               <p>On 1 January 2006 the single market component of the CSME was formally inaugurated, with Barbados, Belize, Guyana, Jamaica, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago as active participants. Six more countries (Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines) formally joined the single market in July.</p>
               <p>In February 2007 CARICOM heads of government agreed that the CSME should be implemented in two phases: firstly, the consolidation of the single market and the initiation of a single economy; and secondly, the finalization of the single economy process, including the harmonization and co-ordination of economic policies in the region and the establishment of new institutions to implement those policies. A Caribbean Competition Commission was inaugurated, in Paramaribo, Suriname, in January 2008, to enforce the rules of competition within the CSME. Haiti signed the revised Treaty of Chaguaramas in the following month.</p>
               <p>In March 2014 CARICOM heads of government issued a policy directive providing for the establishment of a regional Single ICT Space—regarded as the digital dimension of the CARICOM Single Market; in July 2017 they endorsed a workplan for the development of the Single ICT Space. A CARICOM Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICT4D) programme focuses on the implementation of the CARICOM Digital Agenda 2025, which aims to advance the Single ICT Space.</p>
               <p>In July 2018 the 39th summit mandated COFAP, tasked with advancing the CSME, to finalize an investment policy and code, integrated capital market, incentives regime, and model securities legislation, and adopted a Protocol on Contingent Rights, addressing the rights (such as access to social services) of persons moving to another member country. An Agreement on the Protocol for Public Procurement was opened for signature in February 2019. A seven-member prime ministerial Sub-Committee was established in February 2020 to draft a CSME Strategy, and in July 2021 CARICOM heads of government issued the St John’s Declaration on rededication to the implementation of the CSME.</p>
               <p>
        In February 2021 CARICOM heads of government endorsed a framework for a Joint Tourism Policy for CARICOM, including an Emergency Tourism Plan. They agreed that a tourism reserve fund should be established to help build the resilience of the sector which had been devastated by the global measures imposed to control the COVID-19 pandemic. In July 2021 an Interim Tourism Working Group charged the CARICOM Secretariat, together with the 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="CARICOM.IO.001">Caribbean Public Health Agency</xr>
         (CARPHA) and other relevant agencies, with liaising with cruise line companies to establish minimum health and safety requirements to underpin the resumption of cruise sailing in the Caribbean.
      </p>
               <p>In July 2023 the 45th meeting of CARICOM heads of government tasked the CARICOM Secretariat with drafting a timeline of actions to enable the inauguration by July 2024 of a regional capital market. It was also agreed that free movement of all CARICOM nationals within the Community should be effected by 31 March 2024.</p>
               <p>
        In October 2008 an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) was signed (initially, with the exception of Guyana and Haiti) by the Caribbean (the so-called CARIFORUM) and the EU. The first meeting of a CARIFORUM-EU Trade and Development Committee was convened in July 2011 within the framework of the EPA. The text of an updated Joint Caribbean-EU Partnership Strategy was concluded by CARIFORUM and the EU in November 2012, representing a framework for co-operation in areas such as regional integration, climate change, natural disasters, crime, security, the reconstruction of Haiti, and joint action in multilateral fora. In March 2019 the CARIFORUM countries signed an EPA with the UK to govern trade relations following the UK’s departure from the EU. The fifth meeting of the Joint CARIFORUM-EU Council, which was held in November, recommended enhancing co-operation between civil society organizations in the two regions. A new Partnership Agreement between the EU and the 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="ECDEVT.IO.1">Organisation of African, Caribbean and Pacific States (OACPS)</xr>
         was.initialled in April 2021. It was formally signed by both sides in November 2023 and the agreement was provisionally applied from 1 January 2024 (pending ratification by all parties).
      </p>
               <p>In August 1998 CARICOM and the Dominican Republic signed a free trade accord, covering trade in goods and services, technical barriers to trade, government procurement, and sanitary and phytosanitary measures and standards. A protocol to the agreement entered partially into force on 1 December 2001. A Task Force to strengthen bilateral relations was established in 2007. In November 2001 an International Monetary Fund (IMF)-managed Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance Centre (CARTAC) opened in Barbados, to support officials from member countries and the Dominican Republic.</p>
               <p>In July 2023 CARICOM heads of government agreed that existing external trade arrangements should be updated, and emphasized that CARICOM should strengthen its trade and economic linkages with non-traditional partners, and should further explore and strengthen relations with Africa.</p>

               <p>In January 2006 CARICOM heads of government approved a contribution formula allowing for the establishment, in mid-2008, of the Caribbean Development Fund (CDF), with initial financing of US&#8201;&#160;$60m.; the CDF, tasked with providing financial or technical support to vulnerable sectors, countries and regions, commenced full operations in August 2009. In February 2011 heads of government signed an agreement to enable the CDF to grant funds on preferential terms to low-income member countries. In May 2020 CARICOM ministers responsible for trade agreed that the CDF should be replenished and positioned to support the regional post-COVID-19 recovery process. In January 2024 a CDF- and US- supported US&#8201;$100m. CARICOM Resilience Fund was launched.</p>
               <p>In July 2019 CARICOM heads of government welcomed the establishment (in Barbados) of a CARICOM Private Sector Organisation, and designated the Caribbean Congress of Labour as a CARICOM associate institution. In February 2023 the 44th regular CARICOM Conference of Heads of Government decided to amend the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas to provide a framework for mergers and acquisitions in member states.</p>
               <p>In February 2020 CARICOM heads of government endorsed the establishment of a Committee on Caribbean Science and Technology Integration, tasked with formulating a regional Science, Technology and Innovation Policy. A CARICOM Digital Skills Task Force was inaugurated in September 2020. In February 2022 CARICOM ministers responsible for ICT, meeting within a COTED-ICT framework, approved action plans to fast-track regional digital transformation. A US-supported regional Cyber Resilience Strategy 2030 Project was launched in March 2024.</p>

        The CARICOM secre­tariat supports national agricultural programmes through assistance with policy formulation, human resource development and the promotion of research and technology development in the areas of productivity, marketing, agribusiness and water resources management. In April 2021 the inaugural meeting was held of a CARICOM Ministerial Taskforce mandated to direct a new Food Production and Food Security Agenda, focused on transforming the regional agrifood system. A related CARICOM Agri-Food System Strategy aims, 
        <i>inter alia,</i>
         to remove all technical barriers to trade and to support the development of food production corridors. The inaugural CARICOM Agri-Investment Forum was convened in May 2022, in Georgetown (Guyana). A CARICOM `Twenty-five by 2025’ initiative, focused on reducing the cost of extra-regional food imports by one-quarter by 2025, was approved by the Heads of Government Conference in August 2022.

               <p>A Caribbean Regional Fisheries Mechanism (CRFM) was established in 2002 to promote the sustainable use of fisheries and aquaculture resources in the region. It incorporates a Caribbean Fisheries Forum, which serves as the CRFM’s main technical and scientific decision-making body. In October 2014 a Paramaribo-based Caribbean Agricultural Health and Food Safety Agency (CAHFSA) became fully operational. In May 2017 the CRFM, CAHFSA and the CARICOM Regional Organisation for Standards and Quality signed an MOU on future co-operation. A four-year Global Environment Facility-funded initiative was launched in March 2020 to support the sustainable development of the Caribbean Blue Economy through strengthening marine protected areas, fisheries ecosystems, sustainable fisheries value chains, and marine spatial planning. In March 2023 CARICOM welcomed the adoption by UN member states of a draft Implementing Agreement on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biodiversity in Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (this was adopted in June).</p>
               <p>The Caribbean Community Climate Change Centre was formally inaugurated, in Belmopan, Belize, in August 2005. It serves as an official clearing house and repository of data relating to climate change in the Caribbean region, provides advice to governments and other expertise for the development of projects to manage and adapt to climate change, and undertakes training. In June 2012 a Climate Resilient Islands Partnership was established by the Centre, the Indian Ocean Commission and the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme.</p>
               <p>A Caribbean Center for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (CCREEE), endorsed in July 2015 by CARICOM heads of government, was inaugurated in October of that year, in Barbados. In July Community heads of government also endorsed the creation of a Multi-Donor Energy Co-Financing Facility for Caribbean Sustainability, which was to assist member states in transitioning from dependency on fossil fuels towards `cleaner’ alternative and renewable energy resources, and issued a CARICOM Declaration for Climate Action. In March 2016 a Renewable and Energy Efficiency Technical Assistance (REETA) project was initiated, with support from the German Government. In December 2020 CCREEE and the CDF jointly established a CCREEE Project Preparation Facility and Credit Risk Abatement Facility, to support sustainable energy projects in the region. In February 2022 the 33rd inter-sessional meeting requested that urgent focus should be placed on developing CARICOM’s energy policy, in respect both of renewable energy and fossil fuels. An Open-Ended Working Group on Local Content for Sunrise Industries (i.e. new industries) was established.</p>
               <p>CARICOM raised awareness of the specific vulnerabilities of Caribbean SIDS within the Small Island Developing States Accelerated Modalities of Action (`SAMOA Pathway’) plan on building resilience, augmenting partnerships and renewing commitment to the sustainable development of SIDS (2014-24). The Fourth International Conference on SIDS, convened in May 2024, in St John’s, Antigua and Barbuda, adopted the (follow-on) Antigua and Barbuda Agenda for SIDS (ABAS)—a Renewed Declaration for Resilient Prosperity. Under the ABAS, a SIDS Center of Excellence, including a SIDS Data Hub, was to be launched, in Antigua and Barbuda. The international community was urged to support the ABAS, including by reforming the international financial architecture; considering the best means of incorporating multidimensional vulnerability into existing practices and policies for debt sustainability and development support (with consideration to be given to a new Multidimensional Vulnerability Index for SIDS—an initiative of CARICOM subsequently developed by the UN—to be used to determine eligibility for access to concessional financing and development assistance), and supporting the sustainable management of debt; expanding multilateral lending to SIDS; ensuring participation by SIDS and other developing countries in decision-making in global economic and international financial institutions; enhancing the effectiveness of development finance; increasing investment in SIDS; and scaling up climate action and support, including climate finance.</p>
               <p>In July 2019 the 40th CARICOM Heads of Government Conference adopted the St John’s Declaration on reducing the use of plastics and styrofoam, with a view to protecting the Caribbean Sea from waste pollution.</p>
               <p>In June 2022 a new US-Caribbean Partnership to Address the Climate Crisis 2030 (PACC 2030) was launched, following a meeting between CARICOM heads of government and the US Vice-President, Kamala Harris. The initiative aimed to support the development of renewable energy infrastructure. In November the Secretaries-General of CARICOM and the Pacific Islands Forum jointly emphasized that developed countries should urgently follow through a pledge to provide US&#8201;$100,000m. annually to support the climate change adaptation requirements of SIDS and other developing states. A six-member sub-committee established in July 2023 finalized a collective regional approach in advance of the 28th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was held in late November-December, in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.</p>

               <p>CARICOM education programmes have provided assistance for teacher training and facilitated the availability of low-cost educational material throughout the region. In July 2004 CARICOM, in co-operation with the OECS, established a Grenada-based Caribbean Knowledge and Learning Network (CKLN), tasked with strengthening tertiary education institutions throughout the region and enhancing knowledge sharing. A Caribbean Vocational Qualification was introduced in 2007. In March 2010 an Agreement Establishing a Caribbean Knowledge and Learning Network Agency (CKLNA) was opened for signature, providing for the recognition of the Network as a full CARICOM institution. In February 2013 the CKLN initiated C@ribNET, as an online network connecting CARICOM member states and the global research and education community. A CARICOM Education and Human Resource Development 2030 Strategy—addressing systemic education reform in the region—was endorsed in July 2017 by CARICOM heads of government.</p>
               <p>Youth activities supported by the Community have included programmes for disadvantaged youths, a mechanism for youth exchange and the convening of a Caribbean Youth Parliament. The Community has aimed to enhance the capacity of youth and community members to implement programmes aimed at addressing youth gang formation and violence, and to improve livelihood opportunities for marginalized young people. In April 2019, within the framework of a Gangs and Violence: Partnering for Prevention and Social Development project, gang-prevention training was provided in five member states that aimed to equip gang members with life skills that would facilitate their reintegration into law-abiding community life. A CARICOM Regional Youth Development Status Survey, initiated in November 2021, aimed to gather data on challenges confronting young people and on policies to advance their development.</p>
               <p>CARPHA—under which five former regional bodies were merged: the Caribbean Environmental Health Institute, Caribbean Epidemiology Centre, Caribbean Food and Nutrition Institute, Caribbean Health Research Council, and Caribbean Regional Drug Testing Laboratory—was officially launched in July 2013.</p>

PANCAP undertook regional negotiations with pharmaceutical companies to secure reductions in the cost of anti-retroviral drugs. A PANCAP programme on Justice for All: Creating a Facilitating Environment to Reduce HIV-Related Stigma and Discrimination in the Caribbean was introduced in 2011.</p>
               <p usage="edio sacac">In March 2014 CARICOM heads of government established a CARICOM Regional Commission on Marijuana, tasked with studying the health, economic, social, religious, recreational and legal dimensions of marijuana use in member states, and with determining whether the drug should be reclassified. In July 2018 the Commission presented its Final Report to the 39th regular Conference. This recommended that marijuana should be fully declassified as a dangerous drug and reclassified as a strictly controlled substance, within a regulated framework similar to those used for alcohol and tobacco. In response, CARICOM heads of government decided that action should be taken by the relevant authorities in member states to review the status of marijuana, while taking into account relevant international obligations. They stated concern about the impact of marijuana use on young people.</p>

               <p>In July 2005 CARICOM heads of government endorsed a Management Framework for Crime and Security, which provided for regular meetings of a ministerial Council for National Security and Law Enforcement (CONSLE), a Security Policy Advisory Committee, and the establishment of an Implementation Agency for Crime and Security (IMPACS). IMPACS co-ordinates the meetings of five standing committees, comprising member states’ commissioners of police; military heads; chiefs of immigration; heads of customs; and heads of intelligence and financial investigate units. It includes a Regional Crime and Security Strategy Central Coordinating Unit (RCSS-CCU), which provides technical support, advisory services and assistance to member states in implementing the mandate of IMPACS; a Joint Regional Communications Centre; and a Regional Intelligence Fusion Centre. An INTERPOL Liaison Office was established within IMPACS in 2013. The RCSS-CCU played a leading role in shaping the CARICOM Crime and Security Strategy (CCSS), which was adopted in February 2013 by Community heads of government, and co-ordinates implementation of the CCSS both regionally and at national level. A CARICOM Arrest Warrant Treaty (aimed at addressing cross-border crime) was adopted and opened for signature in July 2017 by CARICOM heads of government. At the inter-sessional meeting convened in February 2018 CARICOM heads of government mandated CONSLE and IMPACS to establish an intraregional task force of specialists to recommend innovative solutions to combat a reported increase in violence and crime in member states, and tasked the CARICOM Secretariat with formulating an action plan for the development of statistics on crime and criminal justice. They also endorsed a draft CARICOM Counter Terrorism Strategy.</p>
               <p>A Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI), launched in 2010, aims in particular to advance public safety and security in the region, substantially to reduce the trafficking of illicit substances and to promote social justice. An inaugural Caribbean-US Security Co-operation Dialogue was organized in this context, in May 2010. The first meeting of a CBSI Commission was convened in Kingston, Jamaica, in November. Also in November, at the second meeting of the CARICOM-US Security Co-operation Dialogue, officials agreed to facilitate information sharing throughout the region, and to develop a regional juvenile justice policy. Meeting in October 2016, the Dialogue determined to develop a common regional maritime and airspace strategy. During 2010-22 US&#8201;$832m. in funds were provided through the CBSI. The 11th meeting of the Dialogue was hosted by Saint Lucia in November 2023.</p>

A bilateral Trade and Economic Agreement was signed in July 2000, and in February 2001 a CARICOM office was established in Cuba. At the first meeting of heads of government, convened in the Cuban capital, Havana, in December 2002, it was agreed to commemorate the start of mutual diplomatic relations, some 30 years previously, on 8 December each year as Cuba/CARICOM Day. Subsequently regular summit gatherings have been held. In November 2017 an updated CARICOM-Cuba trade accord was signed, providing for expanded preferential market access. In January 2021 the CARICOM Secretariat denounced the decision by the outgoing US Administration of President Trump to designate Cuba a state sponsor of terrorism. In June 2022 the then CARICOM Chairperson, Belize’s Prime Minister John Briceño, criticized US President Biden for failing to invite Cuba (as well as Nicaragua and Venezuela) to the Ninth Summit of the Americas. The eighth CARICOM-Cuba Summit, convened in December 2022, in Bridgetown, Barbados, welcomed ongoing medical co-operation between Cuba and the CARICOM member states, agreed to continue to share best experiences in the management of the COVID-19 pandemic and other epidemiological conditions, and to continue to assess the potential of using innovative Cuban biotech medicines in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. In the context of a CARICOM-Cuba MOU on sustainable tourism that had been signed five years previously at the sixth bilateral summit, the leaders agreed to renew efforts to promote multi-destination Caribbean tourism. The ongoing multidimensional global crisis was discussed, including the impact of the war in Ukraine on regional food and energy security; in this respect, Cuba agreed to join the CARICOM Ministerial Taskforce on Food Production and Food Security. It was determined that 6 October would be henceforth commemorated as CARICOM-Cuba Day Against Terrorism. The ninth summit was to be organized in December 2025, in Cuba.</p>

               <p>In February 2021 the 32nd CARICOM inter-sessional gathering created a CARICOM Haiti Expert Group. At the beginning of July the 42nd Conference of Heads of Government reiterated grave concern over the political, constitutional, security and humanitarian crisis in Haiti, and shrinking of good governance. Shortly afterwards a special emergency meeting of CARICOM heads of government strongly condemned the assassination of President Moïse, perpetrated by armed attackers on 7 July at his residence in the Pétion-Ville district of Port-au-Prince. On 20 July Ariel Henry was inaugurated as acting President and acting Prime Minister. In mid-August the newly installed CARICOM Secretary-General, Dr Carla Barnett, pledged that the organization would extend support to Haiti, in response to a 7.2 magnitude earthquake, followed by flooding, which had caused more than 2,200 fatalities and 9,000 injuries, and had devastated the local infrastructure in the Grand'Anse, Nippes and Sud areas of that country. In September 2022 CARICOM issued a statement expressing grave concern at the deterioration of the security situation, and of the social conditions, in Haiti. An agreement on a National Consensus for an Inclusive Transition and Transparent Elections, signed in December by acting President and Prime Minister Ariel Henry and by opposition and civil society representatives, provided for a 14-month transition that was intended to culminate in the inauguration of an elected national government in February 2024. In accordance with a decision of CARICOM heads of government, meeting in mid-February 2023, a CARICOM Special Mission, led by the Jamaican Prime Minister, Andrew Holness, visited Haiti at the end of that month, with a view to observing the situation there and engaging with national stakeholders on means of resolving continuing destabilizing gang violence. A three-member CARICOM Eminent Persons Group, established in May, was tasked with extending the Community’s good offices to the Haitian Government and other national stakeholders. In June CARICOM convened a gathering of Haitian stakeholders, in Kingston, Jamaica. At the beginning of October, at Haiti’s request, the deployment was authorized by the UN Security Council of a new mission—the Multinational Security Support (MSS)—that was tasked with supporting the efforts of the Haiti National Police to quell the ongoing gang violence. CARICOM member States were directed by the Council to assist with the establishment of the MSS. The deployment of the MSS was, however, subsequently delayed. Eventually, on 1 March 2024, Kenya formally agreed to supply 1,000 officers to the mission. Shortly afterwards Haiti spiralled further into gang-led anarchy. On 11 March gang elements (which by then had control of around 80% of Port-au-Prince) forced the resignation of Ariel Henry. At that time a meeting convened by CARICOM of Haitian stakeholders and international development partners agreed that a Transitional Presidential Council (comprising seven voting members and two observers) should be established and that the new Council should swiftly appoint an Interim Prime Minister. An inclusive Council of Ministers should then be established. In mid-April CARICOM heads of government welcomed a decree founding the Transitional Presidential Council.</p>

Meeting in July 2015 CARICOM and SICA ministers responsible for foreign affairs agreed to define and strengthen co-operation in integrated disaster risk management, combating climate change, public security, and social and economic development.</p>
               <p>In March 2022 the fourth CARICOM-SICA summit, meeting in Belize, agreed to establish a joint High-Level Technical Committee to co-ordinate and monitor implementation of a revised CARICOM-SICA joint plan of action on socioeconomic development. The two organizations committed to strengthening consultations on foreign policy in regional and international fora in which both were members. In May CARICOM and SICA ministers responsible for foreign affairs met in Panama City to define a common position on the ongoing conflict initiated by the Russian Federation against Ukraine.</p>

               <p usage="sacac">A joint CARICOM-Spain commission was inaugurated in 2002 to foster greater co-operation. In August 2012 a CARICOM-Spain Joint Fund was launched, and, within its framework, a number of regional projects were approved. In March 2006 a CARICOM-Mexico Joint Commission signed an agreement to promote future co-operation, in particular in seven priority areas. The fourth summit-level meeting between heads of state and of government of Mexico and CARICOM was held in October 2017, in Belize City, Belize (the inaugural summit had been held in February 2010, in Mérida, Mexico). A second Colombia-CARICOM ministerial meeting, celebrating 28 years of bilateral relations, was held in Barranquilla, Colombia, in January 2022.</p>

               <p>In July 2019 the 40th CARICOM summit established a sub-committee tasked with establishing a Permanent Africa-Brazil-Caribbean Diaspora (ABCD) Commission. The inaugural CARICOM-African Union (AU) Summit, hosted by Kenya in September 2021, in a virtual format, identified areas for future co-operation, including advancing the Blue Economy. They discussed proposals to establish a new Forum of African and Caribbean Territories and States, a CARICOM/Africa public-private partnership, and a joint CARICOM/AU electronic mass media mechanism. In October 2023 the second annual AfriCaribbean Trade and Investment Forum was convened, in Georgetown (Guyana).</p>

The third Canada-CARICOM Foreign Ministers’ Group Meeting, convened in June 2023, in Washington, DC, USA, committed to continuing to develop a permanent CARICOM-Canada co-operation mechanism (a proposal that had been agreed at their previous meeting, in April 2022). The first Canada-CARICOM leaders’ summit was convened in October 2023.</p>
               <p usage="edio">In July 2014 the first meeting of heads of government of CARICOM and Japan took place, in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. CARICOM-Japan meetings are also held at the ministerial and senior officials level. A CARICOM-Japan Friendship and Cooperation Fund has supported technical co-operation for CARICOM since 2001.</p>

        In December 2017 CARICOM strongly objected to the inclusion of four member authorities in a newly-compiled EU list of jurisdictions deemed to have preferential tax regimes incompatible with international standards of transparency and accountability. In March 2019, in response to the release by the EU of a revised list, containing five CARICOM member states, the Community designated the supportive narrative given by the EU Council as `grossly misleading’ and urged a more collaborative approach. The 40th CARICOM summit meeting, held in July, determined to drive joint action with the EU and the USA on tax governance and related matters. In October 2020 the 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="OTHER.IO.SACAC.123">Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States</xr>
         (OECS), on behalf of CARICOM, raised the issue of blacklisting at the WTO, while also outlining Caribbean states’ relatively limited financial capacity to meet unassisted the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In July 2021 the 42nd CARICOM Heads of Government Conference agreed to pursue more effective co-operation with the OECD's

               <p usage="edio sacac">In July 2021 CARICOM heads of government stated concern at the manner in which the British Governor of the British Virgin Islands (BVI, an associate member) had established—in January, allegedly without due consultation with the elected BVI authorities—a Commission of Inquiry (comprising a sole, British, Commissioner) to address accusations of corruption in the BVI administration. In February 2022 the 33rd inter-sessional gathering agreed to adopt a unified position in support of the BVI at relevant UN fora on decolonization. In early April the Commission of Inquiry reported that a significant level of corruption had occurred, and recommended that the United Kingdom should intervene in the governance of the islands, partially suspending the Constitution and reinstating direct rule for a minimum period of two years. At the end of that month the BVI Premier, Andrew Fahie, was arrested during a visit to the USA and charged with offences relating to alleged drug trafficking and money laundering. In February 2023 the 44th regular Conference endorsed a recent resolution of the UN General Assembly that reaffirmed the BVI’s right to self-determination. In July the 45th Conference congratulated the people of the BVI on a free and fair general election that had been held in April, following which Dr Natalio D. Wheatley (Prime Minister since Fahie’s arrest) had been re-appointed to that role. The Conference called on the UK to remove the threat of direct rule. It was reported in March 2024 that the BVI had stated an interest in becoming a full CARICOM member.</p>

               <heading>Reparations</heading>
               <p>In July 2013 CARICOM heads of government determined that, with respect to the pursuit of reparations for historic acts of slavery and native genocide, national reparations committees should be established in every member state, and that the chairperson of each of these should participate in a new CARICOM Reparations Commission (CRC). The first CARICOM Regional Reparations Conference was held in September, in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. In March 2014 CARICOM leaders endorsed a 10-point CRC action plan aimed at achieving justice for past acts of genocide, slavery, slave trading and racial apartheid, and a new Caribbean Reparatory Justice Programme (CRJP) as the basis for future regional discussions on reparations. Priority areas of the CRJP included seeking a full apology from the governments of European countries that were implicated in the transatlantic slave trade; the initiation of an educational programme to address illiteracy; technology transfer; the establishment of Caribbean cultural institutions; an Indigenous peoples’ development programme; and a debt cancellation initiative. In June 2019 the CRC issued an expanded list of countries that it identified as complicit in trafficking enslaved Africans to the Caribbean; these were to be presented with `letters of demand’ for reparations. In December 2022 the CRC welcomed an apology by the Netherlands Government for that country’s historic engagement in the enslavement of Africans, and hoped that the Netherlands would enter into reparations negotiations with CARICOM, Africa and with Indigenous Caribbean communities.</p>
