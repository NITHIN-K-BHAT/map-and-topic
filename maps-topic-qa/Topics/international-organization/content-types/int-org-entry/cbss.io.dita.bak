          <heading>Activities</heading>
          <p>Heads of government attending the 10th summit of Baltic Sea States, held in Turku, Finland, in June 2014, endorsed three priority areas of co-operation for member states, focused on promoting: Regional Identity; a Sustainable and Prosperous Region; and a Safe and Secure Region. Sustainability, research and innovation, and countering human trafficking are important focal areas of activity. The Council aims to support and to co-ordinate the regional implementation of global initiatives such as the Paris Agreement on climate change, the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and the Sendai Framework on Disaster Risk Reduction. </p>
          <p>
      In June 2021 CBSS ministers (and high representatives) adopted the Vilnius II Declaration, representing a strategic vision for Baltic Sea Region co-operation over the next decade, with a focus on, 
      <i>inter alia</i>
      , the promotion of digitalization in member states, and enhancing youth education and training. 
    </p>
          <p>In March 2022 the Council announced its suspension of the Russian Federation from any participation in its activities, following that country’s military invasion of Ukraine at the end of February in violation of the democratic principles of the organization. Belarus was also suspended as an observer of the Council. On 17 May Russia announced its departure from the organization. A meeting of CBSS ministers responsible for foreign affairs and other high level representatives, held in late May, in Kristiansand, Norway, reiterated the Council’s `unwavering’ support of Ukraine and confirmed that relations with Russia and Belarus, both of which it stated bore full responsibility for the war, would remain severed. A process of reflection on the future orientation of the Council was initiated.</p>
          <p>The 20th meeting of the Ministerial Council, held in June 2023, issued a declaration that emphasized continuing solidarity with Ukraine, support for renewable energy (particularly offshore wind), and the role of the region’s youth in shaping its future. Finland’s presidency of the CBSS during mid-2023-mid-2024 placed a special focus on the cross-cutting themes of comprehensive security, crisis preparedness and resilience.</p>

               <heading>Regional Identity</heading>
               <p>The Regional Identity programme prioritizes culture, youth and higher education. Cultural co-operation is promoted through the Baltic Region Heritage Committee, which was established in 1998 and has working groups on climate change, coastal heritage, underwater heritage and 20th century built heritage, and by the ARS BALTICA agency (formed in 1991). Both are guided by decisions of the Baltic ministers of culture, as well as by relevant regional partnerships. The Eighth Baltic Region Cultural Heritage Forum (addressing `heritage and crisis’) was held in Gdańsk, Poland, in September 2023. During the period January 2023-December 2025 the CBSS was leading a Baltic Sea Region Cultural Pearls initiative, focused on enhancing social resilience; a Culture for Resilience Forum was to be convened in this framework in May 2024, in Jakobstad, Finland.</p>
               <p>The CBSS involves young people in its policy making processes, and has youth working groups on advocacy, culture, security, and environmental sustainability. A Baltic Sea Region Youth Forum (BSRYF) was inaugurated in 2023. The 2023 edition of the annual Baltic Sea Parliamentary Youth Forum was held in August, in Berlin, Germany, and focused on strengthening democratic resilience in the region. The 2023 Baltic Sea Youth Dialogue was convened in November, in Oerversee, Germany, on a related theme.</p>
               <p>Jointly with universities and higher education institutions the CBSS promotes informal education programmes that aim to enhance skills and knowledge throughout the region. CBSS Summer University sessions are held annually, at a variety of venues, covering topics of contemporary relevance.</p>

               <heading>Sustainable and Prosperous Region</heading>
               <p>A CBSS Expert Group on Sustainable Development was established in January 2010. The CBSS promotes, within the framework of the UN SDGs, sustainable economic and social development, and healthy societies and ecosystems, with a particular focus on transitioning towards a competitive green economy. A Baltic 2030 Action Plan was finalized in June 2020 to support the implementation of the SDGs, and the CBSS supports ReGeneration 2030—a regional youth-led movement that promotes the Goals. The CBSS organizes an annual Baltic Sea Science Award, and observes an annual CBSS Science Day.</p>
               <p>The Baltic Sea Labour Forum (BSLF), comprising 28 member organizations (`social partners’) was established in 2011, and in 2024 had the following focal areas: Labour mobility and migration: preventing brain drain, and stimulating brain circulation; Demographic challenges and lifelong learning: addressing ageing population challenges, senior policy, and the silver economy; Knowledge supply: using labour market forecasting, research and technological advances to tackle current challenges to the labour market; Youth employment: maximizing the opportunities of young people in the region by integrating education and labour markets’ needs; and Inclusive labour market. A Baltic Sea Tourism Forum is convened intermittently. A BaltSusBoating 2030 initiative, launched in 2022, aims to develop the Baltic region as a single and sustainable boating tourism destination.</p>
               <p>The Network of Prosecutors on Environmental Crime in the Baltic Sea Region (ENPRO) meets annually and promotes practical co-operation and the exchange of relevant information between member states. The CBSS participates in annual Mare Balticum events (2024: Tartu, Estonia), which focus on the regional bioeconomy. The CBSS Expert Group on Sustainable Maritime Economy focuses on developing the Baltic maritime economy and protecting marine ecosystems. The 10th of a series of Baltic States Climate Change Dialogue Platforms was held in December 2020, focusing on new climate risks. In September 2022 a Baltic Sea Future Forum was convened, in Kiel, Germany. A Baltic Sea Munition Remediation Roadmap (MUNIMAP) project that was underway during 1 March 2024-28 February 2027 aimed to clear hazardous (conventional and chemical) munitions dumped in the Baltic Sea particularly in the aftermath of the Second World War.</p>
               <p>At a dedicated forum that was convened in May 2023, under the auspices of Germany’s CBSS presidency, a Berlin Declaration on Offshore Wind was issued, which identified offshore wind as a major potential source of renewable energy.</p>

               <p>A meeting of CBSS Civil Protection Network Directors-General is convened annually, and the CBSS manages a Baltic Leadership Programme in Civil Protection. During September 2023-October 2024 the CBSS was supporting the establishment of a Ukrainian Civil Protection Faculty. The Baltic Sea Region Border Control Co-operation was initiated in 1996, with participation by member states’ police, border guards, coast guards and customs authorities. Close collaboration is undertaken with the Baltic Sea Task Force on Organized Crime, and regional Prosecutors General. In September 2022 the CBSS initiated a Volunteers and Local Authorities—Baltic Sea Region Network (VOALA) project, with a focus on transboundary disaster prevention and preparedness.</p>
               <p>
        The CBSS Task Force against Trafficking in Human Beings, established in November 2006, had the following cross-cutting strategic objectives during 2020-25: maintaining a regional information and resource centre; enhancing policy coherence on anti-trafficking in the context of migration; strengthening international co-operation and strategic partnerships; and extending technical assistance on migration management and anti-trafficking. Nine strategic priorities were designated for that period: addressing trafficking for labour exploitation (with a particular focus on exploitation in supply chains); emphasizing public procurement as a means of preventing trafficking and forced labour; strengthening efforts to address trafficking for sexual exploitation; enhancing victim protection and empowerment; strengthening multi-stakeholder engagement in combating human trafficking and preventing re-trafficking; highlighting the gender dimension of human trafficking; inter-regional and third country collaboration; addressing human trafficking in a wider migration and soft security context; and discouraging the demand that fuels all forms of human trafficking. The Task Force has issued guidelines for municipalities, diplomatic personnel and the media, and has provided training courses. It has created a Transnational Referral Mechanism in the Baltic Sea Region, which provides points of contact in Bulgaria, Romania and Ukraine—the principal countries of origin for people trafficked to CBSS member states. In October 2022 the Task Force issued a report that addressed the heightened risk of trafficking arising from the ongoing war in Ukraine. In December 2020 the CBSS joined the Inter-Agency Coordination Group Against Trafficking (managed by the 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-UN.1170">UN Office on Drugs and Crime</xr>
        ). A new FRAUD initiative that was launched in February 2024 aimed to address financial crimes and benefit fraud linked to human trafficking.

               <p>In November 2019 a CBSS-hosted PROMISE Barnahus Network was formally established to support a scheme of protective houses for child victims of violence in member states and beyond. The inaugural Barnahus Forum was convened in December 2022, in Stockholm. In May 2020 the CBSS Expert Group on Children at Risk initiated a new mandate and strategy, covering 2020-25, with a focus on the following pillars: prevention and early intervention: strengthening national child protection systems; protection, support and justice: promoting multidisciplinary and interagency services for child victims or witnesses of violence; and promoting joint partnerships for children’s rights and child protection. A Secure Kids initiative, covering the period 2023-25, aimed to strengthen participation by children in disaster risk reduction activities.</p>

The CBSS seeks synergies with the Arctic Council, the Barents Euro-Arctic Council, the Nordic Council of Ministers, and the EU’s Northern Dimension co-operation framework (inaugurated in 1999 and revised, on the basis of input from the CBSS, in 2006, with the adoption, in November, of a long-term Northern Dimension Policy Framework Document, and Political Declaration on the Northern Dimension). An EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region (EUSBSR) was adopted by the European Council in October 2009; an updated action plan for implementing the EUSBSR, finalized in February 2021, prioritized climate change adaptation and co-operation with neighbouring countries.
