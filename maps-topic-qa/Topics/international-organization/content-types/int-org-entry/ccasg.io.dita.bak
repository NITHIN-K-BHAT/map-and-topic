In September 2008 Yemen's inclusion in GCC development planning was approved and Yemen was admitted to GCC control and auditing apparatuses. The full or associate accession of Yemen to the GCC has been envisaged, pending the abatement of civil conflict in that country. In May 2011 the GCC invited Jordan and Morocco to submit membership applications. In December 2017 Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) formed, outside the scope of the GCC, a `joint cooperation committee’, with a focus on economic, political, military, trade and cultural partnership.</content-note>

               <p usage="edio">In December 2011 the 32nd summit of the Supreme Council welcomed a proposal by King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia specifying that the basis of GCC collaboration should progress from the stage of co-operation to full political, economic and military union (as an `Arab Gulf Union Council’). The summit directed the Ministerial Council to form a specialized commission, to comprise three members from each member state, to study the proposal. The initiative was regarded as a means of consolidating the organization in view of the Arab uprisings of 2011 and consequent changed regional political landscape. At the inaugural meeting of the commission, held in February 2012, the GCC Secretary-General noted that the full economic integration of member states would precede political union. An extraordinary summit of GCC heads of state was held in May to discuss the initiative, which, at that time, was most strongly supported by the Governments of Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. In December 2013 Oman publicly expressed its opposition to the proposal.</p>

               <p usage="mena">In 1985 the Supreme Council endorsed a common industrial strategy for the Gulf states. It approved regulations stipulating that priority should be given to imports of GCC industrial products, and permitting GCC investors to obtain loans from GCC industrial development banks. In November 1986 resolutions were adopted on the protection of industrial products, and on the co-ordination of industrial projects, in order to avoid duplication. In 1989 the Ministerial Council approved the Unified GCC Foreign Capital Investment Regulations, which aimed to attract foreign investment and to co-ordinate investments among GCC countries. Further guidelines to promote foreign investment in the region were formu­lated during 1997. In December 1999 the Supreme Council amended the conditions determining rules of origin on industrial products in order to promote direct investment and intra-Community trade. In September 2000 GCC ministers responsible for commerce agreed to establish a technical committee to promote the development of electronic commerce and trade among member states. In December 1992 the Supreme Council endorsed Patent Regulations for GCC member states to facilitate regional scientific and techno­logical research. A GCC Patent Office for the protection of intellectual property in the region was established in 1998, in Riyadh (Saudi Arabia). In December 2006 the Supreme Council endorsed a system to unify trademarks in GCC states. An Intellectual Property Training Center is based at the GCC Secretariat.</p>
               <p>In December 2001 the Supreme Council, meeting in Muscat, Oman, adopted the Economic Agreement Between the Arab GCC States, providing for a future regional economic union. The Agreement set the deadline for a proposed customs union at the start of 2003 and provided for a standard tariff level of 5% for foreign imports (with the exception of 53 essential commodities previously exempted by the Supreme Council). The GCC customs union was inaugurated, as planned, on 1 January 2003, and a GCC Common Market on 1 January 2008. In December 2005 the Supreme Council approved standards for the introduction of a proposed single currency (to be linked to the US dollar). Oman and the UAE withdrew from the single currency process in 2007 and 2009, respectively. An accord on Gulf Monetary Union was signed in June 2009 by Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, and was approved in December by the 30th meeting of the Supreme Council. The introduction of the currency was, however, postponed from the planned deadline of January 2010. A GCC unified value added tax framework that was endorsed ­by the GCC member states in late 2016 became effective in the UAE and Saudi Arabia on 1 January 2018, and in Bahrain on 1 January 2019. Oman published relevant rules in October 2020 that provided for the implementation of the framework from 16 April 2021, and it was envisaged that Kuwait would eventually also follow suit.</p>
               <p>In December 2001 the Supreme Council adopted unified procedures and measures for facilitating the intraregional movement of people and commercial traffic. (A simplified passport system had been approved in 1997 to facilitate travel between member countries.) The GCC adopted new measures in August 2003 that permitted nationals of its member states to work in, and to seek loans from, financial institutions in any other member state. In December 2005 the Supreme Council adopted further measures aimed at facilitating the movement of people, goods and services between member countries, and agreed to permit GCC citizens to undertake commercial activities in all member states. In December 2015 the Supreme Council approved mandatory unified legislation for consumer protection in GCC member states. A GCC Labour and Labour Force Strategy, covering the period 2020-30, was approved at the 40th GCC summit in December 2019.</p>
               <p>In December 2017 the Supreme Council set a deadline of 2025 for the achievement of full GCC Economic Union. Meeting in December 2019 at the 40th summit GCC heads of state determined that a road map should be developed to guide the completion of studies and projects relating to the finalization of the Economic Union, and, in this respect, designated the following as priority topics: human capital and the promotion of economic sustainability; means of collectively advancing GCC states’ global competitiveness; and regional impacts of the People’s Republic of China’ Belt and Road Initiative. In January 2021 the 41st GCC summit emphasized the need to develop a framework that would enable `full economic citizenship’, facilitating people from GCC member states to work, invest, move and relocate throughout the sub-region.</p>
               <p>In December 2021 the 42nd GCC summit emphasized the importance of collective action to advance modern technologies and the digital transformation of the region, including the development of cyber and information security.</p>
               <p>A general framework of a Gulf Strategy for Tourism, covering the period 2023-30, was approved by the Supreme Council in December 2022.</p>
               <p>It was estimated by the IMF that overall the GDP of the GCC countries decelerated to 1.5% in 2023. In May of that year the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia reported that 3.3m. citizens of GCC member states (particularly concentrated in Saudi Arabia, Oman and Bahrain) were living in poverty.</p>

               <p>Although no mention of defence or security was made in the original charter, the summit meeting which ratified the charter also issued a statement rejecting any foreign military presence in the region. The Supreme Council meeting in November 1981 agreed to include defence co-operation in the activities of the organization: as a result, ministers responsible for defence met in January 1982 to discuss a common security policy, including a joint air defence system and standardization of weapons. In November 1984 member states agreed to form the Peninsula (`Al Jazeera') Shield Force for rapid deployment against external aggression, comprising units from the armed forces of each country under a central command to be based in north-eastern Saudi Arabia. In December 1997 the Supreme Council approved plans for linking the region's military telecommunications networks and establishing a common early warning system.</p>
               <p>A joint defence pact was adopted by GCC leaders in December 2000. The pact formally committed member states to defending any other member states from external attack, envisaging the expansion of the Peninsula Shield Force from 5,000 to 22,000 troops and the creation of a new rapid deployment function within the Force. In addition, the pact established a Joint Military Committee to promote co-operation in joint military exercises and co-ordination in the field of military industries. In March 2001 the GCC member states initiated a joint air defence system. In December GCC heads of state authorized the establishment of a Joint Defence Council, comprising member states' ministers responsible for defence, to convene annually to address security-related matters and supervise the implementation of the joint defence pact. The Supreme Council determined in December 2006 to establish a specialized security committee to counter terrorism. A Doha-based GCC Criminal Information Center to Combat Drugs (GCC-CICCD) was established in 2007. In December 2009 the 30th Supreme Council meeting ratified a new defence strategy that included upgrading the capabilities of the Peninsula Shield, undertaking joint military projects, and pursuing co-operation in combating the illegal trade of armaments to GCC member states. </p>
               <p>In March 2017 a new GCC police force (GCCPol), headquartered in Abu Dhabi, became operational. GCCPol was to focus on organized terrorist and criminal activities throughout the region. Joint naval exercises were conducted in October 2015; the establishment of a Bahrain-based joint naval force was approved by the 35th meeting of the Supreme Council, in December 2014.</p>
               <p>In December 2017 the Supreme Council resolved to place the Peninsula Shield Force, the GCC Maritime Coordination Centre and GCC air forces under a new Unified Military Command, in order to strengthen the grouping’s regional security structures. The mandate of GCCPol was expanded at that time to include combating terrorism and terrorist financing. In October 2019 the GCC organized, at its headquarters, a Conference on Counter-Extremism and Terrorism Speech. In December the Supreme Council endorsed a recent study on the proposed establishment of a new Gulf Academy for Strategic and Security Studies (approved by the 34th summit in December 2013); an agreement was signed with the UAE authorities in September 2023 to host the headquarters of the Academy.</p>

                    <p usage="mena">In August 1990 the Ministerial Council condemned Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, and demanded the full withdrawal of all Iraqi troops from that country; the Peninsula Shield Force was not sufficiently developed to be deployed in defence of Kuwait. During the ensuing war between Iraq and a multinational force which took place in January-February 1991, the GCC co-operated with Egypt and Syria, which, together with Saudi Arabia, played the most active role among the Arab countries in the anti-Iraqi alli­ance. In March the six GCC nations, Egypt and Syria formulated the Declaration of Damascus, which announced plans to establish a regional peacekeeping force. The Declaration also urged the aboli­tion of all weapons of mass destruction in the area. In June Egypt and Syria, whose troops were to have formed the largest proportion of the proposed peacekeeping force, announced their withdrawal from the project, reportedly as a result of disagreements with the GCC concerning the composition of the force and the remuneration involved.</p>

The full deployment of 3,000 Peninsula Shield troops to Kuwait was completed in early March, and the force was withdrawn two months later. Meanwhile, the GCC Secretary-General urged the resumption of negotiations in place of military conflict. The GCC summit meeting held in Kuwait, in December 2003, issued a statement accepting the USA's policies towards Iraq at that time, emphasizing the importance of UN participation there, condemning ongoing operations by terrorist forces, and denoting the latter as anti-Islamic.</p>

                    <p usage="edio mena">In mid-2017 Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the UAE (as well as Egypt) severed diplomatic relations with Qatar (having previously done so in 2014), citing national security considerations in protest at the Qatari regime’s ongoing support for the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood movement, and in view of continuing allegations that Qatar was supporting militant extremist Islamist entities. They also closed air, land and sea transport links with Qatar, blocked certain media outlets emanating from there, and announced the expulsion from their territories of Qatari residents and visitors, while recalling their own citizens from Qatar. In June Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and four other countries presented Qatar with a list of 13 demands that were to be met by early July. These included severing all ties with Islamist groupings, shutting down the Qatar-based media outlet Al Jazeera, removing Turkish troops from Qatari territory, downgrading diplomatic relations with Iran, and allowing up to 12 years of monitoring aimed at ensuring compliance. In mid-July, in view of Qatar’s refusal to accede to the 13 demands, they were withdrawn and replaced by a request to adhere to six broader guiding principles. In late July a list of individuals and entities with alleged terrorist links to Qatar was released (this was later expanded from 18 to 90 names). The heads of state of Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the UAE declined to attend the annual meeting of the GCC Supreme Council that was held in December, in Kuwait. In September 2018 the Amir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, addressing the UN General Assembly, stated that his country remained open to unconditional dialogue, and designated the blockade as a violation of international law. Sheikh Tamim failed to attend the GCC summit meeting, convened in Riyadh, in December. In May 2019 Qatar’s Prime Minister participated in an emergency GCC meeting on regional security matters, convened by Saudi Arabia, in Makkah. The Qatari Prime Minister also attended the 40th GCC summit, in December, indicating a rapprochement in GCC-Qatar relations. Diplomatic relations between Qatar and the other GCC states were eventually restored January 2021 at the 41st summit, where members signed an accord affirming `Gulf, Arab and Islamic solidarity and stability’.</p>

                    <p>In October 2012 the GCC inaugurated a support office in Sana’a, Yemen. In March 2013—in accordance with the provisions of an accord that the GCC had mediated in 2011—a Yemeni National Dialogue was initiated on the development of a new Yemeni constitution, and, in January 2014, the National Dialogue reached agreement on a document which was to form the basis of the constitution. From mid-2014 Shi’a Ansar Allah (`Houthi’) militants instigated protests in Yemen, occupying Sana'a, the capital, and in February 2015 the Houthi rebels took control of the Yemeni parliament and other government institutions. Shortly afterwards, the UN Security Council adopted a resolution demanding that the Houthis relinquish power (although not imposing punitive sanctions on them, as proposed by GCC ministers responsible for foreign affairs), and urging the parties to the conflict to abide by the principles of the GCC-mediated accord and National Dialogue. (UN sanctions were eventually imposed in April.) In March 2015 the GCC member states (excepting Oman) launched the month-long Saudi-led military operation `Decisive Storm’ to protect the legitimate Yemeni authorities. From late April this was followed by a new operation, `Restoring Hope’, focusing on pursuing a political solution to the Yemeni crisis and on countering terrorism. Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Pakistan and Sudan also offered their support to the Saudi-led coalition.</p>
                    <p>A conference of Yemeni stakeholders convened in May 2015, with GCC support, adopted the Riyadh Declaration, urging the resumption of the legitimate political process, and referencing the possible framework of a Yemeni `federal state’. A UN-mediated ceasefire agreement was concluded in April 2016, but was subsequently frequently broken. In December the GCC endorsed a roadmap aimed at achieving a comprehensive agreement that had been presented to the parties to the conflict in October by the UN Special Envoy for Yemen. In May 2017 the GCC rejected the recent unilateral formation of a transitional political council in southern Yemen by Maj.-Gen. Aidarous al-Zubaidi (who had recently been dismissed as Governor of Aden by President Abd al-Rabbuh Mansur al-Hadi). The 38th GCC summit, held in December, condemned the murder by Houthi militants of former Yemeni President Saleh, and urged a political resolution of the crisis—to be mediated by the UN Special Envoy, based on UN Security Council decisions, the GCC peace initiative, and the 2014 outcome document of the Yemeni National Dialogue. From 2016 the GCC consistently condemned missile attacks launched by Houthi fighters against targets in Saudi Arabia. In mid-2018 the Saudi-led coalition intensified military action around the strategically important Houthi-held port of Hodeidah (Hudaydah). In December, under UN auspices, representatives of the Yemeni Government and the Houthi militia concluded the Stockholm Agreement, comprising the Agreement on the City of Hodeidah and Ports of Hodeidah, Salif, and Ras Isa, which provided for an immediate ceasefire arrangement and for the phased redeployment of armed forces away from that area; an executive mechanism to facilitate the exchange of prisoners; and a statement regarding the fiercely contested city of Taïz. A Redeployment Coordination Commission was to supervise the ceasefire (which entered into effect on 18 December 2018) and the redeployment of forces, and also to oversee mine action operations. In January 2019 the UN Security Council established the UN Mission in Support of the Hudaydah Agreement (q.v.).</p>
                    <p>
          An extraordinary GCC summit that was convened in May 2019, in Makkah, condemned recent Houthi drone attacks against two oil pumping stations near Riyadh, as well as continuing Houthi missile attacks (including against Makkah) and the recent targeting of commercial ships in the UAE’s territorial waters. Division within the GCC with regard to Yemen became apparent in early August when forces affiliated with the UAE-supported separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC) took control of the southern Yemeni port city of Aden and nearby Abyan. Saudi Arabia condemned the STC’s action and undertook air strikes against its forces, which, in turn, prompted a wave of combat between the STC and forces loyal to (Saudi-backed) President Hadi. Meanwhile, Hadi urged the UAE’s removal from the Saudi-led military coalition. During August, despite their divergent policies on Yemen, Saudi Arabia and the UAE agreed to establish a joint committee with the aim of stabilizing the situation in Yemen, and invited participation by the internationally recognized Yemeni Government and the STC in a new Jeddah Dialogue initiative. Further Houthi attacks aimed at sabotaging the Saudi oil infrastructure occurred in September. On 20 September the Houthis offered to halt attacks against civilian targets in Saudi Arabia and to pursue a peaceful resolution of the conflict. In mid-October 2019 the Jeddah Dialogue culminated in the signature of the Riyadh Agreement, with provisions covering security, military and political issues. These included, 
          <i>inter alia</i>
          , the establishment of a national unity government to represent, on an equal basis, southern and northern Yemen, with the STC to be allocated two ministerial positions, ministerial representation to be given also to other southern Yemeni groupings, such as the Hadhramout Inclusive Conference, National Alliance and Revolutionary Movement. The accord also provided for the Government to return to Aden without obstructions. In December the 40th summit of the Supreme Council welcomed the Riyadh Agreement, and determined to continue to support development projects in Yemen. In January 2021 the 41st GCC summit welcomed the arrival (at the end of December 2020) of the Yemeni Government to Aden. It condemned a terrorist attack against the airport in Aden that had been timed to coincide with their arrival (collectively in one plane), and had caused at least 28 civilian fatalities and many injuries. (The new Cabinet was unharmed.) The GCC heads of state condemned Houthi seizures of oil revenues from a special account intended for use in paying the salaries of Yemeni civil servants. It was estimated at that time that the GCC states had channelled more than US&#8201;$13,000m. in humanitarian and development aid to Yemen since 2015.
        </p>
                    <p> In mid-January 2022 (for the first time since 2018) the Houthis conducted missile and drone attacks against civilian targets in the UAE, including against the international airport serving its capital, Abu Dhabi, and against oil installations. In late March-early April 2022 the GCC hosted UN-mediated intra-Yemeni consultations on the conflict, in Riyadh; on 1 April the UN Special Envoy to Yemen announced that agreement on a truce had been achieved; this was initiated on 2 April, and was subsequently extended until 2 October. In April 2023 the GCC Secretary-General welcomed the release (mediated in March by the UN Special Envoy and the International Committee of the Red Cross) of nearly 900 detainees by the parties to the Yemeni conflict. From October, as a repercussion of the massive intensification of the Hamas-Israel conflict, Houthi attacks targeting Israel-bound oil tankers and other Israeli-affiliated vessels in Red Sea shipping lanes escalated. In December the 44th GCC summit warned of the potential regional spread of the conflict in Gaza. (In early 2024 the United Kingdom and USA launched retaliatory air strikes against various Houthi sites in Yemen.)</p>

          The GCC has repeatedly condemned Iran's occupation of the island of Abu Musa, as well as military exercises con­ducted by Iran in the waters around the other disputed Greater and Lesser Tunb islands (located in the Strait of Hormuz, through which petroleum exports are transported), as a threat to regional security. Successive GCC summit meetings have restated support for the UAE's right to regain sovereignty over the islands (and over their territorial waters, airspace, continental shelf and economic zone). In December 2015 the 36th summit meeting emphasized the need to adhere to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) concluded in July between the P5+1 (China, France, the Russian Federation, the UK and the USA) and Iran, that aimed to ensure that Iran’s nuclear programme remained exclusively peaceful. The GCC leaders reiterated previous statements that the Arabian Gulf region must be kept free of weapons of mass destruction. In recent years the GCC has consistently accused Iran of providing military and financial support to the Shi’a Houthi militants active in Yemen. In September 2019 Houthi attacks against two major Saudi Arabian oil facilities were attributed by the Saudi authorities to Iran and designated as an `act of war’. In that month a new US-led Bahrain-based International Maritime Security Construct was established, with the aim of monitoring the safety of, and escorting vulnerable vessels through sea lanes in the Gulf. In October a gathering in Riyadh of GCC ministers responsible for security and defence and their counterparts from Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Jordan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Pakistan, the Republic of Korea (South Korea), the UK and the USA declared a unified position against the recent attacks against the Saudi energy and economic infrastructure, designating the incidents as, furthermore, an assault against the global economy and wider international community. In December the 40th GCC Supreme Council meeting rejected the continuation of Iran’s interference in the internal affairs of GCC states, reiterated that Iran had attacked Saudi oil supply facilities in September with a view to sabotaging international energy supplies, and urged worldwide condemnation of such terrorist acts against the global economy. In this respect the Council welcomed efforts by the USA to strengthen its military presence in the Gulf region. The Council also condemned non-compliance by Iran with the JCPOA (uranium enrichment activities by Iran had been confirmed by the 
          <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-UN.1837">International Atomic Energy Agency—IAEA</xr>
          —in November), welcomed efforts by the USA to coerce the Iranian regime into ending regionally destabilizing activities, and also welcomed a recent statement by Saudi Arabia, the UAE, the UK and the USA (the `Quartet’) that stated concern over escalating regional tensions caused by acts of destabilization by Iran and by Houthi militia attacks (reportedly using Iranian-made drones and weaponry) on Saudi Arabia. In January 2021 the 41st GCC summit welcomed a recent decision by the USA to designate the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (a component of the Iranian national military) as a `terrorist’ grouping. In September GCC ministers responsible for foreign affairs denounced continuing Houthi missile and drone strikes against Saudi Arabia. They also condemned continuing Houthi disruption of maritime navigation, including an attack on an oil tanker off the coast of Oman at the end of July. The ministers denounced a recent acceleration in uranium enrichment by Iran, in excess of the level required for peaceful use, and urged the Iranian authorities fully to co-operate with the IAEA. They reiterated their unwavering support for the UAE’s sovereignty over the three disputed islands, including over their airspace, territorial waters and continental shelf. In December 2022 the 43rd GCC summit issued a condemnation of continued Iranian support for terrorist groups and sectarian militias in countries including Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen.

                    <p usage="edio">In August 2014 an emergency meeting of GCC ministers responsible for foreign affairs was convened in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, to address the advance of the Islamist extremist group Islamic State and reported threats of an attack upon Kuwait. In September ministers representing the GCC member states, and Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and the USA, issued the Jeddah Communiqué, in which they pledged to support the recently formed inclusive Iraqi Government, and stated their shared commitment to defending the threat posed by all terrorism. Ministers determined to contribute to international efforts to combat Islamic State, including by halting the flow of foreign recruits through neighbouring states, countering the financing of extremists, repudiating their hateful ideology, ending impunity for their crimes and bringing perpetrators to justice. They also agreed to participate in humanitarian relief efforts, and to support the reconstruction and rehabilitation of communities that had been brutalized by the grouping. In December 2016 the 37th summit meeting expressed full support for efforts by the Iraqi Government to seize control of Mosul from Islamic State, while also urging the protection of civilians in liberated areas and the safe return of internally displaced persons. The 38th summit held in December 2017 (in which month the Iraqi authorities had declared victory over Islamic State) agreed to initiate a `strategic dialogue’ with Iraq, and to participate fully in the International Conference for the Reconstruction of Iraq that was hosted by Kuwait in February 2018. In April 2019 a GCC-Iraq Memorandum of Understanding was signed, which aimed to guide enhanced co-operation and regular future bilateral dialogue. In July 2023 the GCC Secretary-General undertook an official visit to Iraq, during which security co-ordination, electricity infrastructure interconnection, investment and combating trafficking in illicit drugs were reportedly addressed.</p>

                    <p>In May 2002 GCC heads of state declared their support for a Saudi-proposed initiative aimed at achieving a peaceful resolution of the Israel-Palestine crisis. GCC heads of state summits have repeatedly urged the international community to encourage Israel to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as well as to halt the construction of settlements on occupied Arab territory. In August 2014 GCC ministers responsible for foreign affairs, addressing the impact on Gaza of the military operation `Protective Edge’, profoundly condemned brutal war crimes, aggression against civilians and state-sponsored terrorism by Israel, while absolutely rejecting Israeli justifications given in this regard. In December 2017 the GCC agreed to work towards reversing a decision by the US Administration in that month to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. In March 2019 the GCC denounced a decision by the USA to accept Israel’s 1981 annexation of the Golan Heights (Israeli forces having captured the area from Syria in 1967). In December 2019 the 40th GCC summit condemned the demolition by the Israeli authorities of numerous homes to the east of Jerusalem, and urged the international community to intervene to prevent the forced evictions and displacement of Palestinians and to resist any attempt inconsistent with international law to alter the legal nature or demographic composition of Jerusalem. Under an arrangement concluded in mid-August 2020 by Israel and the UAE—which was aimed at normalizing bilateral diplomatic relations, and had been negotiated under US auspices—Israel agreed temporarily to delay the annexation of West Bank territory from Palestine. Formal agreements on normalizing relations with Israel were signed by both the UAE and Bahrain on 15 September, in Washington, DC, USA. Bahrain and the UAE thus became the first GCC member states to enter into diplomatic relations with Israel. In September 2021 GCC ministers responsible for foreign affairs determined to form an international investigation committee into allegations of violations perpetrated by Israel (which they referred to as `the Zionist entity’) against Palestinians.</p>
                    <p>In response to the devastating escalation of Hamas-Israeli conflict in early October 2023, the GCC Secretary-General urged restraint, while citing the impact of past Israeli provocations, including violence perpetrated against Palestinian civilians and the storming of Islamic holy sites. An emergency meeting of GCC ministers responsible for foreign affairs, convened in mid-October, in Muscat, at the request of Oman, called for a ceasefire and for the lifting of the ongoing Israeli siege of Gaza. At that time a US&#8201;$100m. GCC relief operation was launched to support Palestinians in the enclave. Qatar soon assumed the role of principal mediator in efforts to facilitate the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas. On 27 October the UN General Assembly adopted a non-binding resolution, put forward by Arab and other states, that called for a humanitarian truce in Gaza. Negotiations led by Qatar and Egypt secured a temporary ceasefire in late November, during which humanitarian aid was delivered via Egypt and an exchange of Hamas-held hostages and Palestinian prisoners in Israeli custody was conducted over a period of seven days. At the GCC summit meeting, held in early December in Doha, Qatar’s Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, called for a permanent ceasefire. Efforts by both Qatar and Egypt to mediate between the warring parties continued into early 2024. In March the GCC Secretary-General reiterated the need for a ceasefire, and regretted the political stances of those countries on the international stage that had not called for a ceasefire or condemned the massive scope of the loss of life in Gaza.</p>
