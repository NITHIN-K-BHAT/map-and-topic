                    <content-note style="NORMAL">Note: On 25 February 2022, in view of the Russian Federation’s military invasion of Ukraine, the Committee of Ministers suspended Russia’s rights of representation in both the Committee of Ministers and the Parliamentary Assembly. On 15 March Russia announced that it was to withdraw from the Council after the Parliamentary Assembly voted unanimously to reject its continued membership. On the following day the Committee of Ministers determined that Russia ceased to be a member of the Council, with immediate effect. Kosovo applied to join the Council on 12 May 2022. The Ministerial Committee voted in April 2023 to refer the application to the Parliamentary Assembly for consideration. In April 2024 the Assembly recommended that Kosovo should be invited to become a Council member; a final decision was to be taken by the Committee of Ministers.</content-note>

               <p>The Committee consists of the ministers responsible for foreign affairs of all member states (or their deputies). It decides all matters of internal organization, makes recommendations to governments and draws up conventions and agreements with binding effect; it also discusses matters of political concern, such as European co-operation and compliance with member states' commitments, in particular concerning the protection of human rights. The Committee meets weekly at deputy ministerial level (assisted by a Bureau of Ministers’ Deputies) and once a year (in May or November) at ministerial level. Six two-day meetings are convened each year to supervise the execution of judgments of the European Court of Human Rights. When deemed necessary the Committee of Ministers may authorize a high-level political conference of specialized ministers from member states, aimed at achieving the Council of Europe’s strategic objectives or responding to significant events relating to human rights, the rule of law or democracy. Chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers rotates on a six-monthly basis (17 May-13 November 2024: Lithuania; 13 November 2024-May 2025: Luxembourg).</p>

               <p>The Assembly meets in ordinary session once a year. The session is divided into four parts, generally held in January, April, June and September. The Assembly submits Recommendations to the Committee of Ministers, passes Resolutions, and discusses reports on any matters of common European interest. It is also a consultative body to the Committee of Ministers, issuing Opinions (for example on membership applications and draft treaties), and it elects the Secretary-General, the Deputy Secretary-General, the Secretary-General of the Assembly, the Council's Commissioner for Human Rights, and the members of the European Court of Human Rights.</p>
               <p>Members of the Assembly are elected or appointed by their national parliaments from among the members thereof; political parties in each delegation follow the proportion of their strength in the national parliament. Members speak on their own behalf rather than representing their governments. The Assembly has 306 representatives (and 306 substitutes): 18 each for France, Germany, Italy, Türkiye and the United Kingdom; 12 each for Poland, Spain and Ukraine; 10 for Romania; seven each for Belgium, the Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, the Netherlands, Portugal and Serbia; six each for Austria, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Sweden and Switzerland; five each for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Denmark, Finland, Georgia, Moldova, Norway and Slovakia; four each for Albania, Armenia, Ireland and Lithuania; three each for Cyprus, Estonia, Iceland, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Slovenia; and two each for Andorra, Liech­ten­stein, Monaco and San Marino. The parliaments of Canada, Israel and Mexico have permanent observer status. The parliaments of Jordan, Kyrgyzstan, Morocco and the Palestinian National Council hold `Partner for Democracy’ status, which aims to provide democracy-building support to national legislatures in regions neighbouring the Council of Europe area.</p>
               <p>Represented in PACE are the Group of the European People's Party (with 146 members at May 2024), the Socialists, Democrats and Greens Group (153 members), the European Conservatives Group and Democratic Alliance (105), the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (92), and the Group of the Unified European Left (33). There were 64 members who were not affiliated to any political organization.</p>
               <p>
        PACE’s 
        <b>Bureau</b>
         comprises the President, 20 Vice-Presidents, Chairpersons of the Political Groups and Chairpersons of the Ordinary Committees. It prepares the agenda and arranges the day-to-day business of the Assembly, and leads its external relations. The 
        <b>Standing Committee</b>
         represents the Assembly when it is not in session, and may adopt Recommendations to the Committee of Ministers and Resolutions on behalf of the Assembly. It consists of members of the Bureau in addition to Chairpersons of national delegations. Meetings are usually held at least twice a year. PACE also has sectoral committees on: Political affairs and democracy; Legal affairs and human rights; Social affairs, health and sustainable development; Migrants, refugees and displaced persons; Culture, science, education and media; Equality and non-discrimination; Rules of pro­cedure, immunities and institutional affairs; Honouring of obligations and commitments by member states of the Council of Europe (the Monitoring Committee); and Election of judges to the European Court of Human Rights.
      </p>
               <p>In January 2024 PACE rejected the credentials of the parliamentary delegation from Azerbaijan, citing a failure to fulfil `major commitments’.</p>
               <p>PACE awards, annually, the Václav Havel Human Rights Prize, and (since 2023) the Vigdís Prize for Women’s Empowerment.</p>

               <heading>European Court of Human Rights</heading>
               <p>The Court was established in 1959, with compulsory jurisdiction, and competence to consider complaints lodged by states parties to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, also known as the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) (q.v.), and by individuals, groups of individuals or non-governmental organizations (NGOs) claiming to be victims of breaches of the Convention's guarantees. The Court comprises one judge for each contracting state. It sits in three-member Committees, empowered to declare applications inadmissible in the event of unanimity and where no further examination is necessary, seven-member Chambers, and a 17-member Grand Chamber. Chamber judgments become final three months after delivery, during which period parties may request a rehearing before the Grand Chamber, subject to acceptance by a panel of five judges. Grand Chamber judgments are final. The Court’s final judgments are binding on respondent states and their execution is supervised by the Committee of Ministers. Execution of judgments includes payment of any pecuniary just satisfaction awarded by the Court, adoption of specific individual measures to erase the consequences of the violations found (such as striking out of impugned convictions from criminal records, reopening of judicial proceedings, etc.), and general measures to prevent new similar violations (e.g. constitutional and legislative reforms, changes in domestic case-law and administrative practice, etc.). When the Committee of Ministers considers that the measures taken comply with the respondent state’s obligation to give effect to the judgment, a final resolution is adopted that terminates the supervision of the case.</p>
               <p usage="ewyb edio eerca">Russia ceased to be a contracting party to the ECHR on 16 September 2022, in accordance with a resolution of the Committee of Ministers in March. The Court subsequently, however, continued to examine and adopt decisions concerning applications directed against Russia pending execution.</p>

          <p>With a view to harmonizing national laws and pooling certain resources and facilities, the Council of Europe has concluded a number of conventions and agreements on European co-operation. From 1989 the Council undertook to increase engagement with all countries of the former Eastern bloc and to facilitate their accession to the organization. The first summit meeting was convened in October 1993, in Vienna, Austria. In October 1997 heads of state or of government met for the second time, in Strasbourg, France, with the aim of formulating a new social model to consolidate democracy throughout Europe. The third summit meeting, held in Warsaw, Poland, in May 2005, issued a Final Declaration and an Action Plan, which defined the principal tasks of the Council over the coming years as promoting human rights and the rule of law; strengthening the security of European citizens; and fostering co-operation with other international and European organizations.</p>

The leaders adopted the Reykjavík Declaration, in which they emphasized that the organization had been founded as a peace project in the aftermath of the Second World War—an agenda that was now being challenged by Russia’s aggression against Ukraine—and reaffirmed commitment to developing mutual understanding among the peoples of Europe and to the Council of Europe’s values and its principles. The meeting adopted an Enlarged Partial Agreement on the Register of Damage for Ukraine; endorsed a series of Reykjavík Principles for Democracy; recommitted to the ECHR as the cornerstone of the organization’s protection framework; and stressed the constructive role of the Council of Europe in environmental protection, environmentally friendly landscape management, and public health.</p>

               <p>In May 2021 the Committee of Ministers adopted a four-year Council of Europe strategic framework, which included the following objectives: promoting the accession of the European Union (EU) to the ECHR; supporting the long-term effectiveness of the ECHR system, with a particular focus on enhancing the implementation of judgments by the European Court of Human Rights; reviewing the efficiency of Council of Europe monitoring mechanisms; promoting civil society participation in Council of Europe activities; and reviewing the European Social Charter system. The Committee reiterated the importance of the Council of Europe’s standard-setting role in the context of digitalization and artificial intelligence (AI). The Council's activities have the following cross-cutting themes: children’s rights; democracy; intercultural dialogue; and combating violence.</p>

        The Committee of Ministers condemned the referendum conducted in mid-March 2014 by the Crimean authorities, in violation of Ukrainian legislation, and deplored Russia’s decision to grant admittance to the territory. In April the Committee of Ministers adopted a report issued by the Advisory Committee on the Framework Convention for National Minorities that stated deep concern over the safety and access to rights of minority populations in Crimea, with particular reference to individuals belonging to the Crimean Tatar and Ukrainian communities. In mid-July the Secretary-General condemned the alleged shooting down from airspace over eastern Ukraine of a Malaysia Airlines passenger flight (MH17), which had resulted in 298 fatalities, and urged that an international investigation should be conducted into the incident without delay. (In November 2022, following a trial in the Netherlands initiated by Dutch public prosecutors, two Russians and one Ukrainian separatist were found guilty, 
        <i>in absentia,</i>
        of murdering all of the plane’s passengers and crew and were sentenced to life terms of imprisonment; their arrests were ordered. In July 2020 the Netherlands Government had concluded that the Government of the Russian Federation should be tried at the European Court of Human Rights over its alleged role in the MH17 atrocity.)

        In May 2021 the Committee of Ministers urged Russia to release all unlawfully detained and convicted Ukrainian citizens, and to repeal decisions curtailing the functioning of the `Mejlis’ (legislature) of the Crimean Tatar minority, which had been accused by Russia of extremism and outlawed in April 2016. In June 2022, in response to a report issued in May by the Council’s Secretary-General on the 
        <publ-name>Human rights situation in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol,</publ-name>
         the Committee of Ministers stated great concern over alleged multiple grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law being perpetrated under Russian rule. The Committee called for unrestricted access of Council of Europe bodies to the Crimean peninsula.

               <p usage="ewyb edio eerca">In mid-February 2022 the Council of Europe’s Secretary-General, the Chairperson of the Committee of Ministers and President of PACE issued a joint statement in which they stated extreme concern at mounting tensions relating to a significant build-up of Russian military forces in the Russia-Ukraine border area. They urged the pursuit of constructive dialogue based on internationally accepted principles. On 21 February the Secretary-General condemned the recent formal recognition by Russia of the self-proclaimed `People’s Republics’ of Donetsk and Luhansk (eastern Ukraine) as being in violation of international law and as representing a breach of the Minsk Agreements (concluded, under OSCE auspices, in 2014-15 as a means of achieving a peaceful settlement of the conflict in Ukraine). On 22 February Russia’s President Vladimir Putin ordered that Russian forces should enter the disputed territories, and on 24 February Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Meeting on that day in extraordinary session the Committee of Ministers urged Russia immediately and unconditionally to halt its military operations in Ukraine, reiterating unwavering commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders. On 25 February the Committee of Ministers suspended Russia’s rights of representation in both the Committee of Ministers and PACE (only Armenia opposed the suspension). The Committee of Ministers determined to co-operate closely with PACE in monitoring the situation and assessing the necessary consequences of Russia’s actions. On 16 March, in accordance with an Opinion adopted by PACE on the previous day, the Committee rescinded Russia’s membership of the Council and of its various partial agreements, with immediate effect.</p>
               <p usage="ewyb edio eerca">In early April 2022 the PACE General Rapporteur on Violence against Women denounced sexual violence allegedly being perpetrated against Ukrainians by Russian and affiliated troops, emphasizing that murder, pillage, torture and rape were being deployed as weaponry to attempt to destroy homes, families, people and morale in Ukraine. At that time the PACE President stated horror at reports that civilians were being killed by Russian forces withdrawing from Bucha and other settlements in the vicinity of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. The Council of Europe Secretary-General also expressed her shock at ongoing events in Ukraine and called for a full investigation, and for accountability for the perpetrators.</p>
               <p usage="ewyb edio eerca">The Council was represented at the Ministerial Ukraine Accountability Conference that was convened in The Hague, Netherlands, in July 2022, by the Netherlands Government, International Criminal Court Prosecutor and EU Commissioner for Justice. In August the Council’s Secretary-General participated in the second summit (held online) of the Crimea Platform, a consultation format that was initiated in August 2021 to consolidate international policy aimed at reinstating Ukrainian control of Crimea. At the end of September 2022 the Secretary-General, the Chairperson of the Committee of Ministers and the President of PACE issued a statement that strongly condemned a decision by Russia to annex occupied Ukrainian territory, in violation of international law. In October PACE adopted a resolution that condemned Russia’s attempted annexation of areas of eastern Ukraine as an `affront to international law’.</p>
               <p usage="ewyb edio eerca">In December 2022 the Committee of Ministers adopted a €50m. Resilience, Recover and Reconstruction action plan for Ukraine, to cover the period 2023-26. This aimed to enhance Ukraine’s public institutions by strengthening the rule of law, democratic governance and the protection of citizens’ human rights. The Council was also to support Ukraine in meeting the requirements of its EU membership candidacy (candidate status having been granted by the European Council in June 2022).</p>
               <p>In early May 2023 the Council of Europe’s Secretary-General participated in an online summit of the leaders of the (37) member states of the coalition aiming to create a Special Tribunal on the Crime of Aggression against Ukraine. (The Council of Europe also supports the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court in its investigations into war crimes and gross human rights violations committed by Russia.) In mid-May the Council of Europe summit meeting adopted an Enlarged Partial Agreement on the Register of Damage for Ukraine, with 41 signatories, including non-member (observers) Canada, Japan, Mexico and the USA, as well as the EU. The Register was to detail evidence and claims information relating to damage, loss or injury caused by Russia's aggression since 24 February 2022 against affected individuals and the state of Ukraine, and was envisaged as a basis for the eventual establishment of an international comprehensive compensation mechanism (to be paid for by Russia). A Declaration on the situation of children in Ukraine was also issued. The first constitutive meeting of the Conference of Participants of the Register was convened in late June 2023. On 10 September the Secretary-General, President of the Committee of Ministers and PACE President issued a joint statement that strongly condemned illegitimate local elections that had just been conducted in Russian-occupied Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhya. In April 2024 PACE recommended that frozen Russian state assets should be seized and used in support of the reconstruction of Ukraine.</p>

               <p>The protection of human rights is one of the Council of Europe’s core goals, to be achieved in four main areas: the effective supervision and protection of fundamental rights and freedoms; the identification of new threats to human rights and human dignity; the development of public awareness of the importance of human rights; and the promotion of human rights education and professional training.</p>
               <p>The Steering Committee for Human Rights, responsible for intergovernmental co-operation in the field of human rights and fundamental freedoms, has been responsible for the elaboration of several conventions and other legal instruments. The most significant treaties in this area include the ECHR; the European Social Charter; the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities; the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages; the Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings; and the Convention on Access to Official Documents.</p>

                    <p>
          The ECHR was adopted in 1950 and entered into force in 1953. In 1959 the European Court of Human Rights was established, with compulsory jurisdiction, and competence to consider complaints lodged by states parties to the Convention and by individuals, groups of individuals or NGOs claiming to be victims of breaches of the Convention's guarantees. Protocols to the ECHR include: No. 12, which entered into force in April 2005, enforcing a general prohibition of discrimination; No. 13, which entered into force in July 2003, guaranteeing the abolition of the death penalty in all circumstances, including in time of war; No. 15, which entered into force on 1 August 2021, and emphasized states’ margin of appreciation in applying the Convention, and the subsidiarity of the Convention to the safeguarding of human rights at national level; and No. 16, which entered into force on 1 August 2018, allowing the highest courts and tribunals of a contracting party to request advisory opinions from the European Court of Human Rights on questions of principle relating to the interpretation or application of the rights and freedoms defined in the Convention and its protocols. In April 2018 Council of Europe ministers responsible for justice adopted the Copenhagen Declaration on reforming the Convention, with a focus on enhancing, 
          <i>inter alia,</i>
           shared responsibility; national compliance; interaction between national and European level; clarity and coherence in interpretation; and the enforcement of sentences. ECHR-KS, an online knowledge sharing platform, was launched in October 2022.

                    <p>During a period of public emergency member states may suspend parts of the ECHR. The derogation of the following provisions is, however, forbidden: Article 2 (on the right to life), Article 3 (on the prohibition of torture and inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment), Article 4, Paragraph 1 (on the prohibition of slavery), and Article 7 (on no punishment without law).</p>

In November of that year, in the aftermath of large-scale Islamist terrorist attacks against Paris, France, also suspended application of parts of the Convention.

                    <p>The European Social Charter, in force since 1965, is the counterpart of the ECHR in the field of protection of economic and social rights. A revised Charter, which amended existing guarantees and incorporated new rights, was opened for signature in May 1996, and entered into force on 1 July 1999. By January 2024 27 member states had ratified the Charter and 35 had ratified the revised Charter. Rights guaranteed by the Charter concern all individuals in their daily lives in matters of housing, health, education, employment, social protection, movement of persons and non-discrimination. A 15-member European Committee of Social Rights decides on the conformity of national situations with the Charter. It considers reports submitted annually by member states, and also considers collective complaints submitted in the framework of an Additional Protocol (1995), permitting trade unions, employers' organizations and NGOs to lodge complaints about alleged violations of the Charter. When a country does not bring a situation into conformity, the Committee of Ministers may, on the basis of decisions prepared by a Governmental Committee (composed of representatives of each Contracting Party), issue recommendations to the state concerned, inviting it to change its legislation or practice in accordance with the Charter’s requirements.</p>
                    <p>A High-Level Conference on the European Social Charter, convened by the Council of Europe in October 2014, in Turin, Italy, launched the Turin Process aimed at strengthening the Charter’s implementation. In February 2015 a follow up conference, convened in Brussels, under the Turin Process, issued the `Brussels Document’ addressing the future of the protection of social rights in Europe. An interparliamentary conference was held in March 2016 within the Turin Process framework. In May 2023 the fourth Summit of the Council of Europe agreed to consider the organization of a further High-Level Conference.</p>
                    <p>The European Code of Social Security and its Protocol entered into force in 1968. These instruments set minimum standards for medical care and the following benefits: sickness; old age; unemployment; employment injury; family; maternity; invalidity; and survivor's benefits. A revision of these instruments, aiming to provide higher standards and greater flexibility, was opened for signature in 1990; by January 2024 the revision had only been ratified by one member state (the Netherlands).</p>
                    <p usage="ewyb edio">The European Convention on Social Security, in force since 1977, currently applies in Austria, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Türkiye; most of the provisions apply automatically, while others are subject to the conclusion of additional multilateral or bilateral agreements. The Convention is concerned with establishing the following four fundamental principles of international law on social security: equality of treatment; unity of applicable legislation; conservation of rights accrued or in the course of acquisition; and payment of benefits abroad. In 1994 a Protocol to the Convention, providing for the enlargement of the personal scope of the Convention, was opened for signature; by January 2024 it had been ratified only by Portugal (and required two ratifications to enter into force).</p>

It conducts periodic visits to police stations, prisons, detention centres, and all other sites where persons are deprived of their liberty by a public authority, in all states parties to the Convention, and may also undertake ad hoc visits when the Committee considers them necessary. After each visit the CPT drafts a report of its findings and any further advice or recommendations, based on dialogue and co-operation. In March 2020 the CPT issued a statement urging governments to ensure that all persons deprived of their liberty were not subjected to degrading treatment in the context of measures taken to contain the COVID-19 crisis. By May 2024 the Committee had undertaken some 520 visits (298 periodic and 222 ad hoc), and had published 472 reports.</p>

The Committee of Ministers may adopt resolutions based on opinions issued by the Advisory Committee. A European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI), which became operational in 1994 and was reconstituted in 2004, is an independent human rights monitoring body that analyses and assesses the effectiveness of legal, policy and other measures taken by member states to combat racial hostility and intolerance towards minorities in European societies. It prepares policy recommen­dations and guidelines on issues of importance to combating racism and intolerance, collects and dissem­inates examples of good practices relating to these issues, and also aims to raise awareness of the problems of racism and intolerance among the general public. ECRI was working on a sixth cycle of country monitoring reports during 2019-24.</p>

Parties to the Convention are monitored by the Group of Experts on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (GRETA). In October 2013 GRETA urged recognition of the following principles: anti-trafficking efforts should focus on every type of trafficking, for example trafficking for labour exploitation (including forced begging) and for organ removal; the private sector and media should play a greater role in helping to prevent trafficking; and the effectiveness of anti-trafficking measures should be subject to thorough independent assessment. In March 2015 the Council adopted a Convention against Trafficking in Human Organs; this entered into force in March 2018. A fourth round of GRETA evaluation visits and reports, focused on the theme `vulnerabilities to human trafficking’, was initiated in mid-2023.</p>

The Council’s Gender Equality Strategy covering the period 2014-29, which was finalized in March 2024 and was to be formally adopted by a high-level conference to be convened in May, was focused on six priority areas: preventing and combating gender stereotypes and sexism; preventing and combating violence against women and girls, and domestic violence; guaranteeing equal access of women and girls to justice; achieving balanced participation of women and men in political, public, social and economic life; ensuring women’s empowerment and gender equality in relation to global and geopolitical challenges; and achieving gender mainstreaming and including an intersectional approach in all the Council’s policies and measures.</p>
                    <p>In March 2019 the Committee of Ministers issued a Recommendation aimed at halting sexism (the first ever such international legal instrument). The Recommendation emphasized that sexism was a widespread manifestation of `historically unequal power relations’ between women and men, preventing the full advancement of women in society.

GREVIO’s membership was expanded in September 2018 from 10 to 15. In March 2021 Turkey (now Türkiye) formally denounced the Istanbul Convention, declaring that the detail of its content was incompatible with the country’s social and family norms and values. The Council of Europe’s Secretary-General deplored the action, and emphasized the importance of the Convention in protecting women and girls. Turkey’s withdrawal was completed on 1 July. Citing similar grounds, in May 2020 the Hungarian legislature had approved a declaration that rejected ratification of the Convention (Hungary being a signatory state, but not a party), and in July of that year the Polish Government also indicated that it would initiate a process of withdrawal. In March 2021 the Polish national legislature voted to present to parliamentary committees for examination draft legislation (titled `Yes to Family; No to Gender’) which would provide for that country’s withdrawal from the Convention. The Istanbul Convention had 38 ratifications as at January 2024 (including the EU, which acceded on 1 October 2023).</p>

In March 2016 the Council of Europe’s Secretary-General emphasized that applications for asylum in European states should be treated on a case-by-case basis without recourse to collective refoulement, within the framework of the ECHR. The Commissioner for Human Rights made a series of recommendations in May 2016 aimed at implementing successfully European standards on migrant integration. These included facilitating family reunion and long-term residency; placing the onus on states to provide free language courses and materials to enable the linguistic and civic integration of migrants; and the provision of equal education, training and employment opportunities to migrants and non-migrants alike. The Commissioner has repeatedly expressed concern over evictions of Roma migrants, rendering them homeless, in several member states. Since 2022 the CEB’s Migrant and Refugee Fund and a dedicated Ukraine Solidarity Fund (established in that year) have provided assistance to countries supporting a massive influx of refugees fleeing the conflict in Ukraine.

Annual sessions are mainly concerned with local government matters, regional planning, protection of the environment, town and country planning, and social and cultural affairs. The 40th session of the CLRAE, held online in March 2021, adopted the following strategic priorities for 2021-26: developing effective public health crisis responses; enhancing the quality of representative democracy and citizen participation; reducing inequalities; addressing environmental issues and climate action; and addressing digitalization and AI in a local context.</p>

In addition, the European Urban Charter (adopted 1992) defines citizens' rights in European towns and cities, for example in the areas of transport, urban architecture, pollution and security; the European Urban Charter II: Manifesto for a new urbanity (adopted in May 2008) updates and complements this in the context of advancing globalization; the Charter on the Participation of Young People in Municipal and Regional Life (adopted in 1992 and revised in 2003) sets out guidelines for encouraging the active involvement of young people in the promotion of social change in their municipality or region; and the Reference Framework on Regional Democracy (adopted in November 2009) outlines principles with regard to the democratic structure, organization, competencies and national context of regional authorities.</p>

          In May 1990 the Committee of Ministers adopted a Partial Agreement to establish the European Commission for Democracy through Law, based in Venice, Italy (`Venice Commission’). The Commission was enlarged in February 2002 and comprises all Council of Europe member states in addition to Kyrgyzstan (which joined in 2004), Chile (2005), the Republic of Korea (2006), Algeria and Morocco (2007), Israel and Tunisia (2008), Peru and Brazil (2009), Mexico (2010), Kazakhstan (2012), the USA (2013), Costa Rica (2016) and Canada (2019). Belarus became an associate member in October 2010, although its participation was suspended in March 2022. The Commission is composed of independent legal and political experts, mainly senior academics, supreme or constitutional court judges, members of national parliaments, and senior public officers. Its main activity is constitutional assistance and it may supply opinions upon request, made through the Committee of Ministers, by PACE, the Secretary-General or any member states of the Commission. Other states and international organizations may request opinions with the consent of the Committee of Ministers. The Commission is active throughout the constitutional domain, and has worked on issues including legislation on constitutional courts and national minorities, electoral law and other legislation with implications for national democratic institutions. The creation of the Council for Democratic Elections institutionalized co-operation in the area of elections between the Venice Commission, PACE, and the CLRAE. The Commission disseminates its work through the CODICES database and the 
          <i>Bulletin of Constitutional Case-Law</i>

The Council’s third summit meeting, convened in Warsaw, in May 2005, identified intercultural dialogue as a means of promoting tolerance and social cohesion; this was supported by the Faro Declaration on the Council of Europe's Strategy for Developing Intercultural Dialogue adopted by ministers responsible for culture convened in Faro, Portugal, in October. In May 2008 a Council of Europe Intercultural Cities Programme was launched, which addressed replacing a multicultural approach to cultural diversity with an intercultural outlook, encouraging interaction between and hybridization of cultures.</p>

        A Partial Agreement in the Social and Public Health Field aims to protect the consumer from potential health risks connected with commonplace or domestic products, including asbestos, cosmetics, flavouring substances, pesticides, pharmaceuticals and products that have a direct or indirect impact on the human food chain. Two European treaties have been concluded within the framework of this Partial Agreement: the European Agreement on the Restriction of the use of Certain Detergents in Washing and Cleaning Products, and the Convention on the Elaboration of a European Pharmacopoeia (establishing legally binding standards for medicinal substances, auxiliary substances, pharmaceutical preparations, vaccines for human and veterinary use and other articles; by January 2024 the Convention had been ratified by 39 states and by the EU). The World Health Organization, the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration and 30 (European and non-European) states participate as observers in the sessions of the European Pharmacopoeia Commission. In 1994 a procedure on certification of suitability to the 
        <i>European Pharmacopoeia</i>
         monographs for manufacturers of substances for pharmaceutical use was established. A network of official control laboratories for human and veterinary medicines was established in 1995, open to all signatory countries to the Convention and observers at the Phar­macopoeia Commission. The 11th edition of the 
        <i>European Pharmacopoeia</i>
        , in force from 1 January 2023, included 2,474 harmonized European standards, or `mono­graphs', 387 general methods of analysis and 2,870 descriptions of reagents.

               <p>Through the Council of Europe’s so-called Pompidou Group 42 states work together, through meetings of ministers, officials and experts, to counteract drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking. (Ukraine joined the Pompidou Group in January 2022.) A revised statute for the Pompidou Group, adopted by the Committee of Ministers in June 2021, extended its mandate to cover new types of addiction (such as internet gambling), and addictive behaviours that are related to tobacco, alcohol and other legal substances. The official name of the Group was amended to reflect its broader mandate, to the Council of Europe International Cooperation Group on Drugs and Addiction. The Group follows a multi­disciplinary approach embracing, in particular, legislation, law enforcement, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and data collection. It maintains an online register of ongoing drug research projects.</p>
               <p>The Council of Europe Convention on the Counterfeiting of Medical Products and Similar Crimes Involving Threats to Public Health (`Medicrime Convention’) was opened for signature in October 2011 and entered into force in January 2016.

               <p>In December 1999 the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and the Dignity of Human Beings with Respect to the Applications of Biology and Medicine: Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine (the Oviedo Convention) entered into force, as the first internationally binding legal text to protect people against the misuse of biological and medical advances. The Convention incorporated provisions on scientific research, the principle of informed patient consent, organ and tissue transplants and the prohibition of financial gain from the disposal of a part of the human body. Protocols prohibiting the medical cloning of human beings, concerning the transplantation of human organs and tissue, and on biomedical research entered into force in, respectively, March 2001, May 2006, and September 2007. A further Protocol, concerning genetic testing for health purposes, entered into effect on 1 July 2018. A draft protocol relating to protection of the human embryo and foetus is under development. A Recommendation on xenotransplantation (i.e. the transplantation of organs between diverse species) was adopted by the Committee of Ministers in 2003. In April 2018 the Council of Europe published a guide to implementing the principle of prohibition of financial gain with respect to the human body and its parts (from both living and deceased donors). A five-year Council of Europe strategy on human rights and biomedical technologies was introduced in June 2020, with a focus on strengthening governance of technologies and equity in healthcare provision, and on placing a high value on physical and mental integrity.</p>

               <p>Implementation of the Council of Europe's work programme concerning the media is undertaken by the Steering Committee on Media and Information Society, which was established in January 2012. Policy and legal instruments have been developed on subjects including exclusivity rights; media concentrations and transparency of media ownership; protection of journalists in situations of conflict and tension; inde­pendence of public service broadcasting, protection of rights holders; legal protection of encrypted television services; media and elections; protection of journalists' sources of information; the independence and functions of broadcasting regulatory authorities; and coverage of legal proceedings by the media. The Council has developed several international binding legal instruments, including the European Convention on Transfrontier Television (adopted in 1989), the European Convention Relating to Questions on Copyright Law and Neighbouring Rights in the Context of Transfrontier Broadcasting by Satellite (1994), and the European Convention on the Legal Protection of Services Based on or Consisting of Conditional Access (2001).</p>
               <p>The Council is engaged with internet governance, standard setting, and with balancing citizens’ fundamental right to privacy and data protection against the free flow of personal data through the internet and the centralization of personal records. A Council of Europe Digital Partnership aims to support governments in drafting internet policy.</p>
               <p>The Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data (referred to as Convention 108) entered into force in October 1985, and had been ratified by 55 states at January 2024 (including eight non-European states—Argentina, Cabo Verde, Mauritius, Mexico, Morocco, Senegal, Tunisia and Uruguay). In July 2004 an Additional Protocol to Convention 108, concerning supervisory authorities and transborder data flows, entered into force. In May 2018 the Committee of Ministers adopted a further Protocol to Convention 108 that provided for updated effective safeguards to protect privacy in the context of transborder data flows through the internet. (The new Protocol was referenced by the EU’s landmark General Data Protection Regulation, which became legally binding and fully applicable in all EU member states on 25 May.) By January 2024 the Protocol had 31 ratifications (including non-member states Argentina, Mauritius and Uruguay). Convention 108 is regarded as a cornerstone of privacy legislation in Europe, and also as a global standard. The Convention’s monitoring committee has given consideration to the development of technologies such as biometric identification, smart cards and video surveillance, and has, accordingly, produced guidelines on the application of data protection principles in respect to these techniques. Furthermore, the potential for linking state databases with those of other agencies, such as insurance companies and banks, has been a priority area of focus. In March 2019 the Council adopted a Recommendation aimed at ensuring respect for the human rights to privacy and data protection when processing citizens’ health-related personal data. In October 2020 the Council issued a report that cited privacy and personal data protection weaknesses in the context of digital contact tracing measures that had been implemented by Convention 108 states parties to contain the spread of COVID-19. The report noted that such digital tracing systems were not broadly harmonized between countries. New guidelines were released in January 2023 on the human rights-focused management of personal data in national digital identity systems.</p>
               <p>A Convention on Cybercrime (the Budapest Convention) entered into force in July 2004 and by January 2024 had 69 states parties (including 24 non-member states). In 2003 member states concluded an additional Protocol to the Convention relating to the criminalization of acts of a racist and xenophobic nature committed through computer systems. A second additional Protocol, focused on enhancing law enforcement authorities’ cross-border access to data (including in the digital `cloud’), was adopted by the Committee of Ministers in November 2021; this was opened for signature in May 2022 and required five ratifications to enter into force (it had received two as at January 2024). In July 2019 the Cybercrime Convention Committee adopted a Guidance Note aimed at facilitating criminal justice measures against attempts to interfere in elections through malicious cyber activities. A set of guidelines covering the use of information and communication technologies during electoral processes was adopted by the Council of Ministers in February 2022. The Council of Europe organizes a so-called Octopus Conference on Cybercrime every 12-18 months, to bring together cybercrime experts from academia, the private sector and international organizations (most recently in December 2023, in Bucharest, Romania). </p>
               <p>In April 2015 the Council initiated, with partners including the International Federation of Journalists, the internet-based Platform to Promote the Protection of Journalism and Safety of Journalists. In April 2016 the Committee of Ministers issued a Recommendation that encouraged member states to review national legislation and practice concerning media freedom, with a view to ensuring that this conformed to the provisions of the European Convention of Human Rights. The Council of Europe analyses case law relating to maintaining a fair balance between the criminalization of defamation and the maintenance of freedom of expression. In March 2024 the Platform stated concern over the unlawful deployment of spyware and abusive lawsuits against journalists.</p>

The Convention, establishing principles and obligations throughout all stages of the design, development and use of AI systems, was finalized in mid-March 2024, and adopted by the Committee of Ministers in May. It was to be opened for signature from 5 September.</p>

A Charter on Sport for Disabled Persons was adopted in 1986. The Committee also prepares the Conferences of European Ministers responsible for Sport (usually held every four years) and has been responsible for drafting two important conventions to combat negative influences on sport. The European Convention on Spectator Violence and Misbehaviour at Sport Events (1985) provides governments with practical measures to ensure crowd security and safety, particularly at football matches. The Anti-Doping Convention (1989), regulating drug testing procedures, had been ratified by 52 countries as at January 2024, including (non-member states) Australia, Belarus, Canada, Morocco, Russia and Tunisia. An Annex to the Convention, listing prohibited substances and methods, is updated annually. In May 2007 the Committee of Ministers adopted the Enlarged Partial Agreement on Sport (EPAS), which aimed to develop a framework for a pan-European platform of intergovernmental sports co-operation and to set international standards. By 2024 EPAS had 39 member states. A Convention on an integrated safety, security and service approach at football matches and other sports events, adopted by the Committee of Ministers in May 2016, was opened for signature in July; it entered into force on 1 November 2017. A Convention on the Manipulation of Sports Competitions entered into force on 1 September 2019.</p>
