               <p>All Commonwealth countries accept the Head of the Commonwealth as the symbol of the free association of the in­dependent member nations. The role is not considered to be a hereditary position, although it was confirmed by consensus in April 2018 that the then heir apparent of Queen Elizabeth II should succeed her in due course. King Charles III, who had acceded to the British throne and as Head of State of 14 other Commonwealth realms, upon the death on 8 September 2022 of Queen Elizabeth II, consequently became the Head of the Commonwealth.</p>

               <p>Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings (CHOGMs), normally convened every two years, are private and informal and operate by consensus. The emphasis is on consultation and exchange of views for co-operation. A communiqué is issued at the end of every meeting. The planned 2020 meeting was postponed in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was eventually held in Kigali, Rwanda, in June 2022, and addressed the theme `Delivering a Common Future: Connecting; Innovating; Transforming'. The next (2024) CHOGM was to be hosted by Samoa, in its capital, Apia, in October. The President of Rwanda, Paul Kagame, was the Commonwealth Chair-in-Office—representing the organization at high-level international meetings and promoting its peacebuilding good offices role—during the period June 2022-October 2024.</p>

Commonwealth ministers responsible for finance convene prior to the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank (2024: mid-October). Commonwealth health ministers meet on the sidelines of the annual World Health Assembly (normally held in May, in Geneva, Switzerland). Ministers responsible for civil society, education, the environment, foreign affairs, gender issues, law, tourism and youth also hold regular meetings. Furthermore, biennial conferences of representatives of Commonwealth small states are convened.</p>
               <p>Senior officials—cabinet secretaries, permanent secretaries to heads of government and others—meet regularly in the year between CHOGMs to provide continuity and to exchange views on various developments. A Women’s Forum, Youth Forum, Business Forum and People’s Forum are organized on the sidelines of each CHOGM. A Commonwealth Day is celebrated annually on the second Monday in March.</p>

               <p>The Secretariat organizes consultations between governments and administers programmes of co-operation. Meet­ings of heads of government, ministers and senior officials decide these programmes and provide overall direction. A Board of Governors, on which all eligible member governments are represented, meets annually to review the Secretariat's work and approve its budget. The Board is supported by an Executive Committee which convenes four times a year to monitor implementation of the Secretariat's work programme. The Secretariat is led by a Secretary-General, elected by heads of government to a normally four-year term of office. The Secretariat has observer status at the UN.</p>
               <p>The Secretariat incorporates Directorates of Economic, Youth and Sustainable Development; Governance and Peace; and Trade, Oceans and Natural Resources. There is also a division of Strategy, Portfolio, Partnerships and Digital.</p>

          <p>In December 2012 Commonwealth heads of government adopted a non-binding Charter of the Commonwealth defining the core values and aspirations of the grouping. It was signed by Queen Elizabeth II (the then Head of the Commonwealth) in March 2013.</p>
          <p>The Commonwealth’s Strategic Plan covering the period 2021-25 was formulated in line with the Commonwealth Charter, the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and the 2015 Paris Agreement on countering climate change. It focused on the following strategic outcomes: Democracy and Governance: greater adherence to Commonwealth values and principles and advancement of good governance; Sustainable Development: working towards sustainable and inclusive economic and social development; Resilience and Climate Action: climate-resilience and low-carbon development to respond to climate and ocean emergencies; and Small and Vulnerable States: addressing their needs and concerns in global governance. Cross-cutting themes were to mainstream gender equality and youth empowerment into Commonwealth planning and programmes, and to enhance the participation of women and young people in all aspects of society.</p>
          <p>
      The June 2022 CHOGM, convened in Kigali, Rwanda, issued a communiqué titled `Delivering a Common Future: Connecting, Innovating, Transforming’, which emphasized, 
      <i>inter alia,</i>
       the importance of international law, and the need sustainably to transform food systems, and to co-operate in facilitating safe, orderly, and regular migration. The meeting also issued a Declaration on Sustainable Urbanisation, and the Kigali Declaration on Child Care and Protection Reform, which focused on ending forced labour, modern slavery, human trafficking, and all forms of child labour (including the recruitment and use of child soldiers).

                    <heading>Promoting Democracy</heading>
                    <p>Through her good offices the Commonwealth Secretary-General works to promote political dialogue in member states, to foster greater democratic space for political and civil actors, and to strengthen institutions. The Secretary-General's good offices may involve `behind the scenes’ diplomacy, sometimes conducted by Special Envoys, to prevent or resolve conflict and assist other international efforts to promote political stability. Advisers may be appointed in support of the organization’s long-term promotion of democracy.</p>
                    <p>In November 1995 Commonwealth Heads of Government adopted the Millbrook Commonwealth Action Programme on the Harare Declaration, to promote adherence by member countries to the fundamental principles of democracy and human rights (as proclaimed in the Harare Declaration, adopted in October 1991). A Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group on the Harare Declaration (CMAG) was established in December 1995 to implement this process. In March 2002 Commonwealth leaders expanded CMAG's mandate to enable it to consider action against serious violations of the Commonwealth's core values perpetrated by elected administrations as well as by military regimes. In October 2011 the Perth CHOGM agreed a series of reforms aimed at strengthening further the role of CMAG in addressing serious violations of Commonwealth political values; these included clearer guidelines and time frames for engagement when the situation in a country causes concern, with a view to shifting from a reactive to a more proactive role. The unjustified postponement of elections, systematic violation of human rights, abrogation of constitutions, undermining of the rule of law and independence of the judiciary, suppression of media freedoms, and closing of the national political space were specified as events that might cause investigation by CMAG.</p>
                    <p>CMAG’s membership is normally reconstituted every two years. In 2024 it comprised Malta, Barbados, Belize, Canada, Ghana, Malaysia, Mauritius, Rwanda and Samoa.</p>
                    <p>The 62nd session of CMAG, held in March 2023, welcomed a series of formal Commonwealth Marlborough Dialogues that had been organized in 2022 to provide an international forum for discussion on means of resolving global challenges. A recent informal Marlborough House Get-Together initiative, with youth participation, was also welcomed.</p>

          The Commonwealth, often working alongside observation teams from regional organizations, monitors the preparations for and conduct of parliamentary, presidential or other elections in member countries at the request of national election management bodies or governments. Furthermore, it offers peer support to enhance the functioning of the electoral process, and assists with the strengthening of institutions between elections. A 
          <publ-name>Compendium of Commonwealth Good Practice on Election Management</publ-name>
           was released in June 2016. In April 2018 the CHOGM held in London and Windsor, UK, agreed updated guidelines on best practice for Commonwealth election observation missions.

                    <p usage="sasia">The Commonwealth Observer Group that monitored the legislative elections held in Pakistan in May 2013 took note of unprecedented levels of violence and intimidation carried out by militant groups that were attempting to disadvantage certain political parties and to disrupt the electoral process. However, the Group found that the elections had overall been conducted successfully, and also noted that they represented the first smooth democratic transfer of power from one elected civilian government that had completed a full term of office, to another. In August 2014, in view of the eruption of anti-government protests in Pakistan, the Commonwealth Secretary-General issued a statement urging respect by all Pakistani stakeholders for upholding democratic norms and processes. In mid-July 2018 a 14-strong team of Commonwealth observers was dispatched to monitor a general election held later in that month in Pakistan. The Commonwealth Secretary-General condemned a bomb attack perpetrated in mid-July against participants in an election rally in Mastung, Balochistan, Pakistan, that resulted in around 150 fatalities. At the time of the general election the Commonwealth Observer Group designated the process—following on smoothly from the completion to full term of two consecutive democratically-elected civilian administrations—as a `successful milestone’ in Pakistan’s history.</p>
                    <p usage="sasia">In December 2018 the Maldives (which had withdrawn from the Commonwealth in October 2016) requested readmission into the organization. Subsequently, the Commonwealth undertook consultations with the Maldives authorities and conducted a country assessment. In April 2019 a Commonwealth Observer Group monitored a general election held in the Maldives. The Group’s final report, released in July, commended the national authorities for the conduct of a peaceful, credible, transparent and inclusive electoral process. The Maldives formally rejoined the Commonwealth in February 2020. A Commonwealth Observer Group observed a presidential election held in that country in September 2023.</p>

In February 2020 the Commonwealth Secretary-General strongly condemned an attack on a North West Cameroon village in which 23 civilians (mainly children) were killed. She urged the Cameroon Government to initiate an impartial investigation into the atrocity.

          At the beginning of March 2020 a Commonwealth Observer Group was deployed to monitor a general election held in Guyana. Initially the Group reported that the conduct of the elections had been `orderly and transparent’, but that electoral reforms were required. In mid-March it issued a statement that regretted `serious and persistent electoral malpractice’ in the aftermath of the election. Following a recount of disputed votes in one electoral region, overseen by a high-level team of the

By that time, according to the international human rights organization Amnesty International, at least 20 activists had been killed and around a further 150 injured by the national security forces. Curfews had been imposed and schools suspended by the national authorities, with a view to controlling the unrest. Numerous reports had emerged of incidents of violence and attacks by protesters against public and private property. In October the Commonwealth Secretary-General held discussions with the Eswatini King, Mswati III. At that time she stated concern over continuing civil unrest in the country, emphasizing the need to accelerate inclusive national dialogue, and reaffirming the organization’s readiness to support a resolution of the situation.</p>

In early August—the outcome of the polls having been contested by opposition members—the Commonwealth Secretary-General urged all stakeholders to pursue constructive dialogue and calm commitment to the democratic process.</p>
                    <p usage="ass ewyb edio">On 30 August 2023 the Commonwealth Secretary-General stated deep concern at the overthrow by the Gabonese military of the controversial longserving president of that country, Ali Bongo Ondimba. She emphasized that according to the Commonwealth Charter the rule of law and principles of democracy must always be upheld. The role of transitional leader of Gabon (which had joined the Commonwealth in 2022) had been assumed by Gen. Brice Oligui Nguema. All institutions of state had been dissolved, and (citing fraud) the results of a recent election—in which 64.3% of votes cast had been allocated to Bongo—had been annulled. Bongo was being held under house arrest, and a son of the deposed president, also in detention, was accused by the coup leadership of treason. In September 2023 CMAG reiterated condemnation of the removal of President Bongo and determined, pending the restoration of democratic governance, to suspend Gabon from participation in all high-level meetings of the Commonwealth. In March 2024 CMAG welcomed progress towards the restoration of constitutional order in Gabon and encouraged Gabon’s Transitional Government to adhere to its schedule of staging credible national elections by August 2025. The Commonwealth Secretary-General was encouraged to provide technical assistance to support Gabon’s transitional processes.</p>

          The Commonwealth Secretariat works to strengthen the rule of law underpinning strong and accountable democratic governance in member states. In July 2017 a Commonwealth Office of Civil and Criminal Justice Reform (OCCJR) was inaugurated, to provide member states with expert advice and knowledge on the drafting of fair and effective legislation in support of sustainable development and the rule of law. The OCCJR has established a Legal Exchange database of statutes and model laws to support the formulation of legislation. In May 2004 the Secretariat issued the Commonwealth (Latimer House) Principles, outlining relations between parliament, the judiciary and the executive in member states. In July 2015 the Commonwealth issued a series of guiding principles for member countries on the appointment, tenure of office, and removal of superior court judges.&#160;The Commonwealth Secretariat assists in combating corruption and financial and organized crime, in particular transborder criminal activities. A triennial meeting of ministers, Attorneys-General and senior ministry officials concerned with the legal systems in Commonwealth countries is organized by the Secretariat. A Commonwealth Law Ministers Declaration on Equal Access to Justice was issued in November 2019, in Colombo, Sri Lanka; this and an accompanying plan of action were endorsed by the June 2022 Kigali CHOGM. In February 2021 Commonwealth law ministers noted that the COVID-19 pandemic had advanced the digitalization and modernization of judicial services in member states, including the use of videoconferencing in courts. Meeting in March 2024 Commonwealth law ministers, Attorney-Generals and senior officials adopted, 
          <i>inter alia,</i>
           Guidelines on the Treatment of Electronic Evidence in Criminal Proceedings in the Commonwealth; an action plan to protect women from online violence; a model law on virtual assets; and proposals on eliminating gender-discriminatory legislation and on ensuring access to legislation for people with disabilities.

The Declaration emphasized the need for common standards and harmonized legal frameworks to guide the development of cyberspace. A UK-funded programme initiated at that time to support the implementation of the Declaration comprises the following four projects: African Cyber Resilience; Electronic Evidence Training in the Caribbean; International Co-operation; and Election Cybersecurity. In December 2019 criminal investigators and prosecutors from Commonwealth countries conducted a collective cybercrime investigation exercise. The first edition of a new

                    <heading>Commonwealth Blue Charter</heading>
                    <p>In recent years the Commonwealth has actively promoted the concept of the Blue Economy, as a model of sustainable development based on the economic contribution of activities from oceans and coastal waters, such as fishing, marine transport, aquaculture and tourism. In April 2018 Commonwealth heads of government endorsed a Commonwealth Blue Charter, enshrining Commonwealth principles on the governance of the world’s oceans. The Charter aimed to provide a framework for co-operation in the effective and sustainable management, protection and preservation of the marine environment. Ten action groups were established to pursue the aims of the Charter, covering: Sustainable Aquaculture; Sustainable Blue Economy; Coral Reef Protection and Restoration; Mangrove Ecosystems and Livelihoods; Ocean Acidification; Ocean and Climate Change; Ocean Observations; Commonwealth Clear Ocean Alliance; Marine Protected Areas; and Sustainable Coastal Fisheries. Some 40 governments have signed up to one or more of the groups. In August 2019 the Commonwealth Secretary-General noted that the organization accounted for the majority of small island developing states (SIDS) and territories, around one-third of the world’s coastal ocean, and for some 42% of coral reefs. In May 2021 the Commonwealth Secretariat launched a web tool and handbook to raise awareness among member states of international funding available to invest in ocean-related initiatives. The Commonwealth Secretariat was represented at the UN Ocean Conference that was convened in June 2022.</p>

        The Commonwealth aims to address the specific needs of small states, accounting for 32 of the Commonwealth member states (globally 42 states are thus defined). It provides technical support and advice, with a focus on trade, vulnerability, environment, politics and economics. In October 2017 the Commonwealth and 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-UN.1275">UNCTAD</xr>
         signed a Memorandum of Understanding on promoting sustainable growth in developing countries, with a special focus on island nations. The fifth Commonwealth Global Biennial Small States Conference (GBSSC—the first having been held in London, in June 2010) was convened in March 2019, in Samoa, on the theme `Building Resilience Through Disaster Risk Reduction’. The 2019 GBSSC included a training session (organized jointly by the Commonwealth and the World Bank) on the mobilization of disaster finance and management of disaster risk. In July 2020, in view of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, the Commonwealth Secretary-General urged the reconsideration of present eligibility criteria for debt relief that exempted some vulnerable SIDS, noting that no Commonwealth small island states (and only six member states overall) qualified for ongoing IMF COVID-19 debt relief, and that some small states, such as Belize and Jamaica, were not among the 30 Commonwealth states granted temporary debt relief by the Group of 20 (G20) major economies. A Commonwealth study that was issued in June 2021 proposed the development of a new Universal Vulnerability Index, which would use more complex criteria than GDP to assess countries’ vulnerability and to determine appropriate accessible levels of international finance. In that month the Commonwealth Secretariat announced that a Commonwealth Tourism Action Plan had been prepared, to support recovery in that sector. In November a SIDS Clean Energy Toolkit was launched jointly by the Commonwealth and the UN Sustainable Energy for All mechanism. The Common Pool Asset Structuring System (COMPASS), a tool that was developed during 2021-23 by the Commonwealth and the Centre for Resilience and Sustainable Development (Cambridge University), aims to enable SIDS to pool governance resources for collective investment projects and for collectively securing non-debt financing from global markets.

Active engagement within the G20 Development Working Group is also pursued, to promote the concerns of small and vulnerable states. In March 2015 the inaugural consultative meeting of a Commonwealth Expert Group on Trade, comprising 27 experts from member states, addressed means of promoting a development-friendly global trading system. The Commonwealth Secretariat has provided assistance to the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group of countries in the negotiation of economic partnership agreements with the European Union (EU) and more generally supports developing countries in strengthening their links with international capital markets and foreign investors. A Commonwealth Business Forum, with participation by business leaders and senior government officials, is held on the sidelines of the CHOGM.

The inaugural meeting of Commonwealth ministers responsible for trade, industry and investment, convened in March 2017, in London, pledged to maximize `Commonwealth advantage’ to boost intra-Commonwealth trade. The CHOGM held in April 2018 committed to increasing the value of intra-Commonwealth trade to $2,000,000m. by 2030 (compared with an estimated $600,000m. in 2016); this goal was affirmed in June 2023 by Commonwealth ministers responsible for trade.</p>

          A 20-member Commonwealth Digital Connectivity Group promotes the sharing of knowledge, best practices and experiences, with a view to fostering digital development. In February 2020 the Commonwealth released a report titled 
          <publ-name>The State of the Digital Economy in the Commonwealth</publ-name>
          , which found that while 85% of citizens of high-income Commonwealth states had access to the internet, the corresponding proportion from low-income Commonwealth countries amounted to only 18%. Women from poorer countries were found frequently to experience a `double digital divide’, as they were less likely than men to have either internet access or to own a mobile phone. The report noted that such disparities drove economic disadvantages and restricted global economic growth. Governments were urged to pursue policies that promoted digital trade, enhanced access to broadband internet, and advanced up-skilling in technology, science and mathematics. A Commonwealth Digital Hub was initiated in February 2022. In June 2023 Commonwealth ministers responsible for trade determined to establish a Legal Reform and Digitalisation Working Group, to advance the development of paperless trade.

Advancing inclusive education—focusing on reaching excluded and underperforming groups—is a priority area of activity. In June 2015 the 19th meeting of Commonwealth ministers responsible for education, in Nassau, Bahamas, established the Commonwealth Education Ministers Action Group (EMAG). The development of a set of universal Commonwealth Quality Standards for Education was announced in June 2016. In February 2017 EMAG endorsed proposals setting out new education policy and curriculum frameworks in member states that aimed to accelerate progress towards achieving the UN’s SDGs. An expansion of the number and scope of Commonwealth scholarships was also agreed at that time. Meeting in February 2018, in Nadi, Fiji, Commonwealth education ministers issued the Nadi Declaration: Education Can Deliver, in which they committed to working to ensure 12 years of free, quality education for all.
