          <p usage="ebrd.io.98">The EBRD was founded in May 1990 and inaugurated in April 1991. Its aim is to contribute to the development of modern, efficient, resilient, green, inclusive market economies—underpinned by respect for the principles of multi-party democracy, pluralism, the rule of law and respect for human rights—in the transition countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, Central Asia, the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean (since 2011-12), and (to enter into effect in 2025) a limited selection of sub-Saharan African states.</p>

               <p>The Bank has 73 country shareholders; the European Union (EU) and the European Investment Bank (EIB) are also shareholder members in their own right. At the end of February 2022 the Board of Directors approved a resolution to suspend the access to EBRD resources and expertise of both the Russian Federation and Belarus, as a consequence of the war against fellow Bank member Ukraine; this decision was endorsed in early April by the Board of Governors. (Belarus remained a Bank shareholder.) Iraq became the Bank’s 74th shareholder in November 2023, and Benin the 75th shareholder in late April 2024. An application by Côte d’Ivoire was approved in principle in October 2023 (at the same time as that of Benin); applications by Ghana and Senegal were approved in February 2024.</p>

               <p id="EBRD.IO.75">In May 2010 EBRD shareholders agreed to increase the Bank's capital from €20,000m. to €30,000m., through the use of a temporary increase in callable capital of €9,000m. and a €1,000m. transfer from reserves to paid-in capital. (A previous capital increase had been implemented in 1996.) At 31 December 2022 subscribed capital was €29,759m., of which paid-in capital amounted to €6,217m. In May 2023 the Board of Governors—recognizing that additional shareholder support would be required to fund the Bank’s programme of assistance to Ukraine (which remained under attack from Russia)—agreed to give consideration to a potential third increase in paid-in capital. An agreement on a capital increase of €4,000m, bringing the total authorized capital to €34,000m, was concluded in December.</p>

          <heading>Activities</heading>
          <p>The EBRD helps its beneficiaries to undertake structural and sectoral reforms to enable their full integration in the international economy. To this end, the Bank promotes the establishment and improvement of activities of a productive, competitive and private nature, particu­larly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and works to strengthen financial institutions. It mobilizes national and foreign capital, to­gether with expert management teams, and helps to de­velop an appropriate legal framework to support a market-orientated economy. The Agreement establishing the EBRD specified that its operations should not displace commercial sources of finance.</p>
          <p>The Bank provides extensive financial services, including loans, equity and guarantees, and aims to develop new tailored forms of financing and investment. In accordance with a revised concept introduced in 2017, investment decisions were to be made with regard to six, country-specific `transition qualities’, aimed at achieving more well-governed, competitive, inclusive, green, resilient and integrated sustainable market economies as the planned outcome of the transition process. Bank activities are designed to align with the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and accompanying Sustainable Development Goals. The Bank supports its investments through policy dialogue and technical assistance.</p>
          <p>During 2021-25 the Bank was implementing a Strategic and Capital Framework (SCF), which aimed to accelerate transition in countries of operation through the crisis and recovery stages of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, with a focus on three principal themes: supporting the transition to a `green’, low-carbon economy; accelerating the transition to a digital economy; and promoting equality of opportunity, through enhancing access to skills, employment, finance and entrepreneurship, and strengthening support for women, young people and other vulnerable population groups. By 2025 some 75% of the Bank’s lending was to be focused on the private sector. The Bank’s Equality of Opportunity Strategy (2021-25) addresses the intersection of characteristics (for example gender, age, level of skills, disability, or displacement) with external stresses and shocks, social biases and legal frameworks.</p>
          <p>The EBRD’s area of operations has expanded significantly since its inception. The Bank’s initial focus was on the transition of countries from Central, Southern and Eastern Europe and the Caucasus, and Central Asia, and on the Russian Federation. New operations were terminated at the end of 2007 in the Czech Republic, which was deemed to have `graduated’ from the Bank. (In March 2021, however, the Bank’s Board of Directors approved a request temporarily to resume activities in that country in order to assist its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.) Mongolia and Montenegro became new countries of operations in 2006. Türkiye (then known as Turkey), which had been a founding member of the EBRD, became the 30th country of oper­ations in November 2008. Kosovo became a member in December 2012. In March 2011 the Bank signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the EIB and the European Commission to enhance co-operation in activities outside of the EU region. In May the then Group of Eight (G8) major industrialized nations declared their support for an expansion of the Bank’s geographical mandate to assist transitional economies in the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean (SEMED) region. Several countries in the region have subsequently been granted country of operations status. Meanwhile, India and San Marino became shareholder members of the Bank in July 2018 and in June 2019, respectively. In May 2023 the Board of Governors adopted a resolution that formally endorsed in principle a `limited and incremental’ expansion of the geographical scope of the Bank’s activities into Iraq (admitted in November as a shareholder), and also into sub-Saharan Africa. Benin became the first sub-Saharan African shareholder in April 2024. By that time applications by Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana and Senegal had also been endorsed in principle.</p>
          <p usage="edio">In March 2020 the EBRD’s shareholders approved an emergency Solidarity Package, amounting to €1,000m. in new and additional financing, and entailing measures aimed at supporting businesses to counter the economic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis. In April financing available through the Solidarity Package was increased to €4,000m. The Bank determined to focus all its activities and financial resources until the end of 2021 on a pandemic response and recovery package that totalled €21,000m. A Vital Infrastructure Support Programme was also established in April 2020.</p>
          <!--~ x.2020: Global Infrastructure Forum hosted by the EBRD-->
          <p usage="ewyb edio eerca casee">In March 2022 the EBRD President and heads of other multilateral banks issued a joint statement in which they stated horror at Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. They noted that massive reconstruction would be required, while the broader regional and global impacts of the conflict would include reduced energy and food supplies and higher inflation. At that time the EBRD approved a War on Ukraine: EBRD Resilience Package to support Ukraine and affected neighbouring countries (that were accommodating influxes of Ukrainian refugees, and very exposed to disruptions to supply chains, trade and remittances). An EBRD Crisis Response Fund was established, focused on the Ukraine situation. The Bank invested €2,100m. in Ukraine during 2023.</p>
          <p>Through a longstanding collaboration with the Food and Agricultural Organization of the UN, and by fostering partnerships with public authorities, agribusinesses, and other international agencies and multilateral banks, the EBRD aims to strengthen regional food security; its Private Sector for Food Security Initiative promotes investment in food production. In May 2022, in response to the wider global impacts of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Bank, with the IMF, the World Bank and other international financial institutions collectively issued the Joint International Financial Institution Plan to Address Food Insecurity, with a focus on the following six objectives: (i) support vulnerable people; (ii) promote open trade; (iii) mitigate fertilizer shortages; (iv) support food production now; (v) invest in climate-resilient agriculture for the future; and (vi) co-ordinate for maximum impact.</p>
          <p usage="ewyb edio casee eerca">In March 2017 the European Banking Co-ordination Initiative (`Vienna Initiative')—launched in 2009 by the EBRD, IMF, World Bank Group and EIB to promote dialogue between authorities in emerging European economies, official multilateral donors and private banks—established a Working Group on Capital Markets Union. This was tasked with promoting the diversification of investment finance in Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe and with analysing structural obstacles and regulatory gaps that restrict capital market development in the region. A Vienna Initiative Full Forum Meeting is convened annually.</p>

               <heading>Financial Operations</heading>
               <p id="EBRD.IO.78">In the year ending 31 December 2022 the EBRD approved 431 operations, in 35 economies, for which it invested funds of €13,071m. (a significant increase over the €10,446m. invested in 2021). The Bank also directly mobilized external resources in 2022 amounting to an estimated €1,746m. Gross annual disbursements in that year totalled €8,800m. The total project value—including both Bank and non-EBRD finance—was €38,028m. In 2022 18.4% of the Bank’s new investment was for Eastern Europe and the Caucasus, 18.4% (also) for Southern and Eastern Mediterranean, 18.0% for Central Europe and the Baltic States, 16.1% for South-Eastern Europe, 12.5% for Türkiye, 11.4% for Central Asia, and 5.3% for Greece. Some 42.7% of project financing in 2022 was allocated to investment in the financial sector. In total 74% of the Bank’s investments were focused on the private sector in that year.</p>
               <p>High priority is given to attracting external finance for Bank-sponsored projects, in particular in countries at advanced stages of transition, from government agencies, international financial institutions, commercial banks and export credit agencies. The EBRD's Technical Co-operation Funds Pro­gramme (TCFP) aims to facilitate access to the Bank's capital resources for countries of operations by providing support for project preparation, project implementation and institutional de­velopment. Resources for technical co-operation originate from regular TCFP contributions, specific agreements and contributions to Special Funds (of which the Bank was administering 16 at 31 December 2022). In 2016 the Bank established an Equity Participation Fund (EPF) to attract long-term institutional capital into eligible private sector investments. By the end of 2022 €258m. had been invested under the EPF in 35 schemes.</p>

               <p>In September 2015 the EBRD’s Board of Directors endorsed a Green Economy Transition (GET) policy approach, under which financing for sustainable low-carbon projects was to be progressively increased (from 31% of total investments in 2015). In January 2020 the EBRD and International Renewable Energy Agency signed an MOU on future collaboration. An energy sector strategy for the period 2024-28, which aimed to accelerate the decarbonization of energy in member countries, was approved by the Board of Directors in December 2023.</p>
               <p>The proportion of EBRD green investment contracted during 2020 (to 19% of total investments, compared with 46% in 2019), owing to the urgency of containing the COVID-19 emergency. In October 2020 the Bank’s Board of Governors approved an updated GET 2021-25 strategy, to support inclusive, resilient green recovery from the COVID-19 crisis, and to increase the green proportion of EBRD investment to more than 50% by 2025 (in 2021 and 2022 it accounted for, respectively, 51% and 50% of total investments). Policy engagement on long-term means of achieving decarbonization, resource and energy efficiency, and a reduction in pollution in countries of operation—while leaving no one behind, i.e. promoting a socioeconomically `just transition’—were to be enhanced over the course of GET 2021-25. Furthermore, from 1 January 2023 the Bank’s activities were to be fully aligned with the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. The strategy provided for the extension, initially, of large stimulus packages aimed at boosting economic growth. Principal thematic areas of action included developing green financial systems, climate adaptation, industrial decarbonization, sustainable food systems, support for environmental and urban intrastructure, green buildings, energy systems integration, sustainable connectivity, and safeguarding natural capital. A High-Impact Partnership on Climate Action was launched by the EBRD in November 2021. During that month the Bank issued a joint statement with other major multilateral development banks regarding `Nature, People and Planet’, placing greater emphasis on defining future operations and strategies within a `nature-positive’ framework. From 2022 the disruption to energy supplies and an inflationary impact on energy prices caused by Russia’s war against Ukraine heightened focus on energy security, and the need for energy efficiency through a reduction in consumption, and for decarbonization and the diversification of energy sources. The Bank prioritized the further integration of countries of operations in the region into the EU energy grid.</p>

        The EBRD’s online GET Knowledge Hub covers, 
        <i>inter alia,</i>
         bioenergy, carbon market development, climate change adaptation and climate finance partnerships, carbon pricing and renewable energy. The EBRD issues Environmental Sustainability Bonds (so-called green bonds), and allocates the proceeds from these to its green project portfolio. In November 2020 the Bank doubled (to €1,900m.) funding of its Green Cities programme, promoting urban sustainability and green development. At March 2024 the Bank’s Green Cities portfolio comprised 89 investments. More than 50 municipal authorities had signed up by that time—requiring commitment to developing and implementing a long-term Green City Action Plan. In September 2021 the Bank initiated a new Energy Compact, which was to support the provision of green and reliable energy to the Green Cities.

               <p>The EBRD’s Green Economy Financing Facilities (GEFF) support investment in green technologies. During 2018-33 the EBRD and the Green Climate Fund (GCF—established under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change) were implementing a GCF-GEFF partnership that was supporting investments in emissions reduction and climate adaptation technologies. In March 2021 the EBRD and GCF agreed to increase the total value of GCF-GEFF co-operation (by an additional US $497m.) to $1,400m. The Bank’s Finance and Technology Transfer Centre for Climate Change (FINTECC), engaged in 17 countries of operation in 2024, supports businesses in harnessing innovative technologies to promote renewable energy, energy, water and materials efficiency. A €30m. advisory EBRD Corporate Climate Governance Facility, initiated in late 2022, aims to enhance the capacity of businesses to manage climate-related risks and promote green investment.</p>

When conditions permitted, the Package was then to be extended to incorporate reconstruction activities, such as restoring critical infrastructure, rebuilding businesses and livelihoods, facilitating access to services, and fostering good governance. In late April the EBRD increased the ceiling of its trade finance support to Ukraine to €330m., with an emphasis on boosting food security as well as general trade. In July the Bank participated in a Ukraine Recovery Conference, held in Lugano, Switzerland, which endorsed a series of Lugano Principles, aimed at guiding a sustainable reconstruction and recovery process. Some €1,700m. was committed to investments in Ukraine, and an additional €200m. raised from partner banks, in 2022. During that year tailored support packages were developed by the Bank for Ukraine’s national electricity provider Ukrenergo (amounting to €520m.), the state-owned petroleum and gas company Naftogaz (€500m.), and the national railway company Ukrzaliznytsya (which received €150m. in emergency liquidity funding). Support was extended by the Bank to the EU’s Solidarity Lanes action plan, focused on facilitating Ukraine’s grain and other exports, and investments made to assist Ukraine’s primary farming sector, food retailers and exporters.

At that time the EBRD joined other international financial institutions active in the Middle East and North Africa region to endorse the so-called Deauville Partnership, established by the then G8 in May to support political and economic reforms being undertaken by several countries, notably Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia. A dedicated SEMED Investment Special Fund (ISF), facilitating investments in the region, was established in February 2012. Jordan and Tunisia were admitted as members of the EBRD in January of that year and, with Morocco (a founding member of the Bank), were granted countries of operations status on 1 November 2013: with immediate effect those countries’ assets and capital resources hitherto held in the SEMED ISF were transferred to the balance sheet of the EBRD. In May 2014 the EBRD granted country of operations status to Cyprus on a temporary basis, until the end of 2020. The Board of Governors granted country of operations status to Egypt in October 2015. In July 2017 Lebanon became a shareholder member of the Bank; the Bank’s Board of Governors agreed that it become a country of operations in September. In May of that year the Board of Governors determined that the EBRD should also engage in the West Bank and Gaza, for an initial period of five years. The first loans were approved for the West Bank and Gaza in 2018, financed through a separate trust fund. (Investments in the West Bank and Gaza amounted to €22.3m. in 2022.) Libya, accepted as a shareholder member in 2014 pending the conclusion of relevant formalities, formally became the Bank’s 71st member in July 2019.

In early March 2023 the Bank approved a finance framework for Turkish partner banks of up to €600m. to support relief and reconstruction activities, and livelihoods, jobs and human capital in southeastern areas of Türkiye that had been struck in February by devastating earthquakes. By 15 March 2024 cumulative EBRD investment in Türkiye totalled €19,483m. In July 2020 the EBRD undertook its first risk-sharing transaction in the SEMED region, extending an unfunded risk participation guarantee, amounting to US&#8201;$5m., to provide a Jordanian Bank with increased working capital to support a major Jordanian manufacturing business during the COVID-19 crisis. In September 2021 the EBRD provided the Bank of Palestine with a $5m. trade finance line, to enable it to issue guarantees with respect to pre-export and post-import financing. The Bank’s trade finance support in 2022 to the food and agribusiness sector in the SEMED region—which was particularly adversely affected by the disruption to imports of Ukrainian grain and wheat—totalled €600m.

A €150.5m. loan was extended to Tunisia’s state-owned Office des Céréales in that year to fund cereal imports that covered 15% of Tunisia’s annual consumption. The Bank invested €75m. in November 2022 to support the construction of Egypt’s first green hydrogen facility, and in April 2023 approved a $100m. loan for the development of a new wind farm (projected to be the largest in Africa) to be located in Egypt’s Gulf of Suez region.</p>
