      ECA’s three core functions are: convening regional intergovernmental and multistakeholder platforms that establish development policy frameworks, standards and action plans; conducting multisectoral research and analysis; and providing policy advice to member states. The Commission’s work is focused on achieving the UN’s 
      <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-UNDP.001">2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development</xr>
       and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and is guided by major regional strategies, including the Abuja Treaty on the establishment of an African Economic Community, 
      <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-AU.1">Agenda 2063</xr>
       (the African Union—AU’s long-term framework for economic and social transformation of the continent), the AU Development Agency (AUDA-NEPAD), and the Agreement Establishing the AfCFTA, adopted by an extraordinary summit of AU heads of state and of government in March 2018. In March 2021 the inaugural meeting took place of a new Regional Collaborative Platform: Africa (RCP: Africa), which aimed to enhance the effectiveness and co-ordination of UN development entities. The Platform is chaired by the UN Deputy Secretary-General, with ECA’s Executive Secretary and the Director of the UNDP Regional Bureau for Africa acting as Vice-Chairs.
    </p>
          <p usage="ass">ECA supports the independent, Kigali, Rwanda-based SDG Center for Africa, which was inaugurated in July 2016 to promote a continental vision for the attainment of the SDGs, and to extend technical support to assist in their implementation.</p>
          <p>ECA helps to organize the annual Africa Regional Forum on Sustainable Development (ARFSD), which reviews progress being made towards achieving the SDGs. The 10th ARFSD was to be held in Cairo, Egypt, in late April 2024, on the theme `Reinforcing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Agenda 2063 and eradicating poverty in times of multiple crises: the effective delivery of sustainable, resilient and innovative solutions’.</p>
          <p>During 2024 ECA’s work programme focused on the following five strategic directions: Advancing ECA’s position as a premier knowledge institution; Developing macroeconomic and structural policy options to accelerate economic diversification and job creation; Designing and implementing innovative financing models for infrastructure, and for human, physical and social assets for transforming Africa; Contributing solutions to regional and transboundary challenges; and Advocating for Africa at the global level and developing regional responses with regard to global governance issues.</p>

               <heading>Macroeconomics and Governance</heading>
               <p>ECA advocates for a sound regional macroeconomic policy framework, with the aim of promoting inclusive growth. Member states are supported in forecasting and analysing macroeconomic indicators, in designing, implementing and evaluating development strategies, in mobilizing financing, and in following up global and regional development frameworks. ECA assists with the collection of data; the preparation of annual economic surveys; the compilation of reports on regional economic conditions, governance and development management; the production of regional and national policy studies covering economic reforms, international and illicit financial flows, domestic resource mobilization, external debt, and exchange rate management; and the dissemination of best practices relating to specific aspects of economic management. </p>
               <p>In March 2021 ECA initiated a Liquidity and Sustainability Facility (LSF) to support the issuance by member state governments of sovereign bonds. An ECA policy brief on sovereign debt restructuring in Africa was issued in late 2022. The Commission organized a workshop on debt management in October.</p>
               <p>In January 2024 ECA forecast that growth in GDP across Africa would increase from 3.3% in 2023 to 3.5% in 2024; tight financial conditions, compounded by mounting geopolitical fragmentation, were deemed to pose risks to industrial production and global trade.</p>
               <p>ECA aims to improve member states’ capacity for good governance and development management. The Commission provides support for the African Peer Review Mechanism, an AUDA-NEPAD initiative whereby participating member governments mutually assess compliance with a number of codes, standards and commitments that uphold good governance and sustainable development. In January 2017 ECA and the Mechanism signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) establishing a continuous partnership in support of the goals of the AU and the UN. ECA assists civil society organ­izations to participate in governance; supports the development of private sector enterprises; and helps to improve public administration in member states. To achieve these aims the Commission provides technical assistance and advisory services, conducts studies, and organizes training workshops, seminars and conferences at national, subregional and regional level for ministers, public administrators and senior policymakers, as well as for private and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).</p>

               <p>Since 2006 ECA, with the AfDB and UNDP, has organized an annual African Economic Conference (AEC) to promote an exchange of ideas among economists and policymakers on development policy. The 2023 AEC was held in Addis Ababa, in November, focusing on the theme `The Imperatives for Sustainable Industrial Development in Africa’. In July 2016 the UN designated 2016-25 as the Third Industrial Development Decade for Africa.</p>
               <p>In April 2020 ECA established a multi-agency Africa Knowledge Hub for COVID-19, and in mid-2020 ECA and partner agencies initiated an Africa Communication and Information Platform, which aimed to provide national and regional COVID-19 governmental task forces with data on survey responses, and actionable economic and health findings. ECA joined the African Vaccine Acquisition Task Team in August. In 2024 ECA was implementing a pilot AfCFTA-anchored Pharmaceutical Initiative, which aimed to scale up the expansion of local pharmaceutical production, and to promote continental pooled procurement and harmonized regulatory standards.</p>

An interconnected Trans-African Highways scheme, initiated by ECA in 1981, is focused on nine designated principal axes of roads across the continent. An Urban Mobility component aims to improve sub-Saharan African urban transport services, while a Trade and Transport component aims to enhance the international competitiveness of regional economies through the establishment of more cost-effective services for shippers.

ECA provides the technical secretariat for ClimDev-Africa. Since 2011 ClimDev-Africa has organized annual Climate Change and Development in Africa Conferences (CCDAs). The first session of the fourth edition of a series of Africa Climate Talks (`ACTs!-4’), co-hosted by the ACPC in July 2022, addressed the theme `Ensuring a just and equitable transition and human security in Africa: Building resilience’. CCDA-XI was held in Nairobi, Kenya, in September 2023, as the technical section of a parallel high-level Africa Climate Summit. ClimDev-Africa Phase II was launched at the conference. CCDA-XI reports inform the African contribution to UN climate change conferences.In March 2024 ECA and the AU and partners co-organized the sixth Africa Climate Resilient Investment Summit (ACRIS-6).</p>
