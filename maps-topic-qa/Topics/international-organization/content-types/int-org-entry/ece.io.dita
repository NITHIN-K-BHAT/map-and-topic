          <p id="IO-UN.924">UNECE was established in 1947, initially to co-ordinate post-war economic assistance. The Commission promotes pan-European and transatlantic economic integration, and acts as a multilateral forum for dialogue and co-operation on economic and sectoral issues. It provides analysis, policy advice and assistance to governments, gives focus to UN global mandates on economic issues, and establishes norms, standards and conventions to facilitate international co-operation within and beyond the region.</p>

          <p>The guiding principle of UNECE activities is the promotion of sustainable economic growth among its member countries. To this end it provides a forum for communication among states; negotiates international legal instruments concerning trade, transport and the environment; and supplies statistics and economic and environmental analysis.</p>
          <p>UNECE has identified four high-impact cross-cutting `nexusâ areas that inform its activities: Sustainable use of natural resources; Sustainable and smart cities for all ages; Sustainable mobility and smart connectivity; and Measuring and monitoring progress towards the SDGs.

         and 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In March 2022 UNECE released an updated online Portal on Standards for SDGs, encompassing around 20,800 standards that contribute to realizing the Goals. The 2024 Regional Forum was held in March, in Geneva and online, on the theme `Reinforcing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in the UNECE region in times of multiple crises: The effective delivery of sustainable, resilient and innovative solutionsâ. Five peer learning round table sessions were convened to review in depth implementation of the following SDGs: 1 (ending poverty), 2 (ending hunger), 13 (climate action), 16 (promoting peaceful and inclusive societies), and 17 (partnerships).

          UNECE aims to increase the expertise of governments to identify and implement successful PPP projects. An International Centre of Excellence (ICoE) on PPPs was established in Geneva in 2011, under the aegis of UNECE, and several affiliated specialized subsidiary PPP centres were subsequently designated, covering, 
          <i>inter alia,</i>
           policies, laws and institutions (based in Paris, France); smart and sustainable cities (Barcelona, Spain); water and sanitation (Lisbon, Portugal); and public transport and logistics (Beijing, Peopleâs Republic of China). In May 2017 UNECE and China initiated a PPP capacity building programme within the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative that was launched by China in 2013 with the aim of developing infrastructure and trade along traditional routes between Asia, Europe and Africa. The ICoE formulates standards and recommendations on international best practices in the use of PPPs. UNECE published a legal framework in December 2023 to underpin support by PPPs for the implementation of the SDGs. The Eighth UNECE International PPP Forum was to be hosted from Ä°stanbul, TÃ¼rkiye, in May 2024.

               <p>In May 2019 a Declaration on Gender Responsive Standards and Standards Development, formulated by UNECE, was signed by some 50 organizations, including international, regional and national standards bodies. UNECE maintains a series of Indicators of Gender Equality, and a Gender Database. In February 2020 UNECE urged an acceleration of the closure of the gender pay gap across the region, noting that, on average, men in member states were paid 16% more than women in terms of hourly rates, and received 21% higher monthly earnings.</p>

               <p>UNECE promotes coherent, efficient, safe and sustainable transport systems. It hosts the secretariat of the Inland Transport Committee, an intergovernmental forum to promote co-operation, as well as the formulation and negotiation of numerous international agreements, conventions, norms and standards relating to road, rail, inland water and combined transport. These international legal instruments, which are developed by specialized intergovernmental working parties with participation from, among others, equipment manufacturers, transport experts and consumers, include measures for improving vehicle safety, limiting vehicle emissions, simplifying border crossing procedures, improving road traffic safety, setting the conditions for developing coherent infrastructure networks, and providing for the safe transport of dangerous goods.</p>

        In April 2020 UNECE issued guidance on good practice in mobility management, covering, 
        <i>inter alia,</i>
         sustainable home to work mobility; home to school/university; major events; sustainable urban logistics and mobility plans; car parking management; on-demand transport options to reduce car dependency in sparsely populated areas; and improving communications and raising awareness on sustainable mobility possibilities.

        <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-UN.2461">World Health Organizationâs Europe Office</xr>
         addresses the integration of environment and health concerns into transport policy, spatial planning, the health impacts of transport, and the promotion of sustainable urban transport, and of cycling and walking. A PEP Academy offers relevant guidance to policy makers and other key stakeholders.&#160;In May 2021 regional ministers responsible for transport, health and the environment issued the Vienna Declaration on promoting clean, safe and healthy transport. In 2024 so-called PEP Partnerships covered Health Economic Assessment Tools (supporting the development of practical tools for estimating the economic value of the health impacts of regular walking or cycling); Active Mobility (promoting implementation of a Pan-European Master Plan for Cycling Promotion that was adopted in May 2021, and aiming to develop a similar plan on active mobility); Child- and Youth-friendly Mobility; Eco-Driving; Jobs in Green and Healthy Transport; Integration of Transport, Health and Environmental Objectives into Urban and Spatial Planning; and Sustainable Tourism Mobility.

               <p>In May 2019 the parties to the (as it was then named) European Agreement Concerning the International Transport of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR)âwhich was drafted under UNECE auspices and entered into effect in 1968âdetermined that the designation `Europeanâ should be removed from the ADRâs name, from 1 January 2021, with a view to characterizing it clearly as a global agreement and thereby prompting further accessions by non-European countries. Further updates to the Agreement (`ADR 2023â) entered into effect on 1 January 2023.</p>
               <p>The intergovernmental UNECE Working Party for Road Traffic Safety was established in 1988. UNECE hosts a UN Road Safety Fund (UNRSF, established in April 2018), and also provides secretarial services to the UNâs Special Envoy on Road Safety. In October 2021 UNECE published a global plan to support the UN Decade of Action on Road Safety (2021-30). During a High-level Meeting on Global Road Safety, convened in June 2022 at UN Headquarters in New York, some US $15m. was pledged to support UNRSF projects in low- and middle-income countries during 2022-25.</p>
               <p>UNECEâs World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations has global participation and meets twice a year. In March 2016 amendments to the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic entered into force that permitted the use of strictly controlled automated driving technologies in traffic.</p>
               <p usage="casee eerca">In February 2019 the Inland Transport Committee adopted a Convention on the Facilitation of Border Crossing Procedures for Passengers, Luggage and Load-Luggage carried in international Traffic by Rail, which aimed to shorten journey times for train passengers on international journeys, in particular in Europe and Asia. The Convention was opened for signature in April.</p>
               <p>In January 2023 an electronic `eTIRâ procedure was added to UNECEâs 1975 Customs Convention on the International Transport of Goods under Cover of TIR Carnets, providing a customs transit system across Europe and into North Africa and the Middle East. The TIR system had more than 33,000 authorized users by 2024.</p>
               <p>UNECE addresses transport trends and economics, and compiles transport statistics. In February 2018 UNECE issued international technical standards to support the creation and exchange of electronic consignment notes for the international transport of goods by road. A UNECE Roadmap to harmonize the development and use of intelligent transport systems in member countries was endorsed by the Inland Transport Committee in February 2021.</p>

        Since 2022 UNECE has hosted a prototype Transport Data Commons database, offering cost-free, publicly available access to data on transport and climate change. In February 2023 UNECE and the Islamic Development Bank initiated an internet-based International Transport Infrastructure Observatory, hosting data on, 
        <i>inter alia,</i>
         rail and road infrastructure, ports, inland waterways, intermodal terminals and border crossing points in 79 countries in Europe, North Africa, the Middle East and Asia.
