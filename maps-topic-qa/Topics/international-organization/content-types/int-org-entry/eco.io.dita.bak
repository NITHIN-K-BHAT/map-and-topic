          <p>In 1985 ECO replaced the Regional Cooperation for Development (which had been estab­lished in 1964 as a tripartite arrangement for economic co-operation between Iran, Pakistan and Turkey—now known as Türkiye). Seven additional members were admitted to ECO in November 1992. The main objectives of co-operation are advancing the sustainable economic development of member states; the development of the regional transport and communications infrastructure; economic liberalization and privatization; the progressive removal of trade barriers and the promotion of intraregional trade; advancing the region’s role in global trade, and the gradual integration of member states’ economies with the global economy; the mobilization and utilization of the region’s material resources; the interconnection of power grids; the effective utilization of the region’s agricultural and industrial potential; co-operation on narcotics control; ecological and environmental co-operation; strengthening regional cultural ties; and pursuing mutually beneficial co-operation with regional and international organizations. In March 2017 the 13th summit meeting, held in Islamabad, Pakistan, issued the Islamabad Declaration, in which it resolved to implement efficiently an ECO Vision 2025, giving priority to trade; transport and connectivity; energy; tourism; economic growth and productivity; and social welfare and the environment.</p>

               <heading>Trade and Investment</heading>
               <p>A regional Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ECO-CCI) was established in 1993. A Transit Trade Agreement and an Agreement on the Simplification of Visa Procedures for Businessmen of ECO Countries came into effect in December 1997 and March 1998, respectively. In April 2008 an ECO Trade Agreement (ECOTA), which envisaged the development of an ECO Free Trade Area, entered into force. An ECOTA Cooperation Council meets regularly; by 2024, however, ECOTA was not yet operational, and in 2022 intra-regional trade was reported to represent only around 8% of member states’ total external trade. In July 2020 a virtual meeting on trade facilitation confirmed that a trade specialist had been recruited to identify obstacles to ECOTA’s implementation. The Secretary-General noted in September that ECO had initiated studies on the removal of non- and para-tariff barriers to trade.</p>
               <p>An ECO Trade and Development Bank (ETDB), headquartered in İstanbul (with its main branches in Tehran, Iran, and Islamabad) commenced operations in 2008.</p>
               <p>
        The first meeting of ECO heads of investment promotion agencies was held in December 2016. In October 2018 ECO heads of privatization administrations issued the Baku Declaration, in which, 
        <i>inter alia,</i>
         they agreed to establish an Investment Forum of the Privatization Organizations of the ECO Member States and International Investors, and to focus on the uses of public-private partnerships. The inaugural Meeting of the Heads of the National Development and Wealth Funds of the ECO member states, convened, in a virtual format, in December 2020, emphasized ECO’s strategic focus on attracting investment and expanding intraregional trade as a means of promoting sustainable socioeconomic development. The fifth ECO Business Forum was held in Tashkent, in November 2023, on the sidelines of the 16th ECO summit.
      </p>
               <p>The first meeting of ECO Heads of Tax Administrations was convened in January 2013. In December 2016 an ECO Regional Institute for Standardization, Conformity Assessment, Accreditation and Metrology (RISCAM) was established in Tehran. In February 2018 the inaugural meeting was held of a Karachi, Pakistan-based ECO Reinsurance Company.</p>

               <heading>Transport and Communications</heading>
               <p>Co-operation in the area of transport and communications is of particular regional importance, given that seven ECO member states are landlocked. Relevant activities are guided by the 1993 Quetta Plan of Action and Istanbul Declaration, and by the AlmatI Outline Plan for the Development of Transport Sector in the ECO Region, which was adopted in October 1993 by the first meeting of ECO ministers responsible for transport.</p>
               <p usage="eerca sasia mena">In March 1995 ECO heads of state concluded formal agreements on the establishment of a regional joint shipping company and airline; the latter project was terminated in May 2001 by the Council of Ministers, owing to its unsustainable cost, and replaced by a framework agreement on co-operation in the field of air transport.</p>
               <p>A Transit Transport Framework Agreement (TTFA) entered into force in May 2006, and has eight protocols, that cover road, rail and inland water transportation, customs control, motor vehicles (including third-party insurance), and terms of reference for the ECO’s Transit Transport Co-ordination Council. In May 2018 ECO transport ministers determined to prioritize complementary networking between dry ports in landlocked member countries and sea ports in coastal member states. ECO specialized and expert working groups manage the development of road and rail corridors under the TTFA, including the Islamabad-Tehran-Istanbul (ITI), Kyrgyzstan-Tajikistan-Afghanistan-Iran (KTAI), Kazakhstan-Turkmenistan-Iran (KTI), Istanbul-AlmatI, and Bandar Abbas-AlmatI road and rail corridor projects. The ITI road corridor was activated in October 2021. Guidelines on Cross Border Facilitation Measures were endorsed by a Ministerial Meeting on Transport that was held (in a virtual format) in December 2020, with a view to supporting trade flows and the unhindered passage of essential medicines and foods across regional border crossing points. A Ministerial Declaration was adopted at that time which urged member states fully to implement the TTFA; by 2024 the Agreement had been ratified by Azerbaijan, Afghanistan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan and Türkiye. In August 2022, while participating in a Ministerial Transport Conference of Landlocked Developing Countries, the ECO Secretary-General recommended several actions aimed at facilitating transit to the landlocked ECO member states, including diversifying transit routes, developing border crossing facilities that minimize personal contact, digitizing transit procedures, promoting electronic visas, eliminating costly transshipment measures, and establishing joint border monitoring systems.</p>
               <p>In December 2017 the second meeting of ECO ministers responsible for information and communications technologies (ICT) (the first having been held in 2012) adopted the 2025 ECO Regional Strategy for Information Society Development, and an action plan for its implementation. A Ministerial Policy Dialogue on Our Digital Future was organized during the Third ECO Ministerial Meeting on ICT, convened in July 2023, in Tehran.</p>

               <p>In August 2016 the inaugural meeting of ECO public and private sector energy and petroleum consortiums was convened in Tehran. Participants recommended the establishment of an ECO Energy Consortium, to manage the implementation of regional projects in the petroleum, gas, petrochemical, electricity and renewable energy sectors, and an ECO Energy Investment Fund. An ECO experts’ group on renewable energy sources meets regularly. A Clean Energy Centre for the ECO region (CECECO) was under development in 2024, as well as a project to establish an integrated ECO Regional Electricity Market.</p>
               <p>The ECO Institute of Environmental Science and Technology (ECO-IEST, established in 2011) is hosted by the Karaj, Iran-based University of the Environment. In December 2014 ECO ministers responsible for the environment issued the Istanbul Declaration on Climate Change and Green Economy, in which they agreed to designate the environment and the impacts of climate change as cross-sectoral organizational priorities. ECO Vision 2025 noted the importance of supporting regional biodiversity and forestry; alleviating the regional impacts of climate change; and combating long-range trans-boundary air pollution.</p>
