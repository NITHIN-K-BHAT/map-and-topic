It reports to the UN Economic and Social Council. Ministerial and intergovernmental conferences on specific issues may be held on an ad hoc basis with the approval of the Commission. The 80th session was to be hosted from Bangkok in late April 2024, with a focus on the theme `Leveraging digital innovation for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific’.</p>

      . These included recommitting to curbing greenhouse gas emissions (more than one-half of which, globally, originate in the region); promoting clean energy technologies; developing the use of climate change-related statistics; advancing digital co-operation and inclusion; increasing the use of space applications; strengthening sustainable urban development; and minimizing the consequences of water depletion in the (Central Asian) Aral Sea. The session included meetings focused on means of catalyzing climate finance and investments, and a climate solutions-themed fair.

        Since 2014 ESCAP has supported the organization of an annual Asia-Pacific Forum on Sustainable Development (APFSD), with participation by regional stakeholders including representatives of governments, civil society, and the private sector. The fourth APFSD, convened in March 2017, adopted a roadmap to guide regional co-operation in the implementation of the 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-UNDP.001">2030 Agenda</xr>
        . At the eighth APFSD, held in March 2021, a Regional Collaborative Platform: Asia and the Pacific (RCP: Asia and the Pacific) was inaugurated, with participation by UN development entities active in the region. The Platform is chaired by the UN Deputy Secretary-General, with ESCAP’s Executive Secretary and the Director of the UNDP Regional Bureau for Asia and the Pacific acting as Vice-Chairs. ESCAP’s annual 
        <publ-name>Progress Report</publ-name>
         on the implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) was published in mid-February 2024; subtitled `Showcasing Transformative Actions’, it outlined successful trends as well as outstanding challenges in the regional pursuit of the Goals. The value in enhancing SDG indicator data availability—especially for most vulnerable population groups—was emphasized. The 11th APFSD was convened later in February, in Bangkok, on the theme `Reinforcing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and eradicating poverty in times of multiple crises: The effective delivery of sustainable, resilient and innovative solutions in Asia and the Pacific’. At the meeting the UN Deputy Secretary-General warned that, on the current trajectory, the region was 32 years behind schedule in achieving the SDGs.

               <p>ESCAP is concerned with strengthening national capabilities to achieve environmentally sound and sustainable development by integrating issues such as the sustainable management of natural resources into economic planning and policies. The Environment and Development Division focuses on energy; water, green growth and green economy; quality of growth (ensuring inclusive development); and urban development. Activities include the consideration of energy resource options, such as rural energy supply, energy conservation and the planning of power networks; strengthening the formulation of policies on the sustainable development of land and mineral resources; and the promotion of integrated water resources development and management, including water quality and conservation and a reduction in water-related natural disasters. The Division collates information on issues related to climate change, conducts regional seminars on climate change adaptation, and provides training in clean technologies and guidance on the reduction of harmful gas emissions.</p>
               <p>At the inaug­ural meeting of an Asian and Pacific Energy Forum (APEF), convened by ESCAP in May 2013, ministers responsible for energy in member countries determined to strengthen energy security and the sustainable use of energy throughout the region. In May 2015 the Commission initiated an internet-based Asia Pacific Energy Portal, and agreed to establish an ESCAP Committee on Energy; this met for the first time in January 2017. The second APEF, convened, under ESCAP auspices, in April 2018, in Bangkok, committed to increasing the share of renewable energy and rationalizing the use of fossil fuels in the region. The third APEF was held in October 2023, in Bangkok. A ministerial declaration was adopted by the Forum emphasizing the need to enhance the region’s energy resilience and security, while pursuing initiatives to secure affordable and sustainable energy for all. A fifth Forum of Ministers and Environment Authorities of Asia Pacific was also convened in that month, in Colombo, Sri Lanka and online (the first such Forum had been held in May 2015). The participants committed collectively to addressing the interlinked crises of climate change, pollution and biodiversity loss.</p>

A fourth phase of the initiative was launched in July 2021, with a focus on advancing member states’ capacity to implement climate action and green recovery policies. The 18th SINGG Policy Consultation Forum was held in October 2023, on the theme `Accelerating Collaborative Efforts for Climate Action in Asia and the Pacific’.</p>

         found that most countries in the region did not have the necessary data or financial means to support climate adaptation and natural disaster mitigation activities, and set out proposals for urgent transformations that would be required in the areas of low-carbon mobility and logistics, energy, and international trade and investment.
