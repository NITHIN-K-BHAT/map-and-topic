           and the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, to promote investment in Eastern Europe; the EBRD began operations in April 1991. In the 1990s so-called Europe Agreements were signed with Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland (1991), Bulgaria and Romania (1993), Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania (1995), and Slovenia (1996), which led to formal applications for membership of the EU. On 1 May 2004 the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia acceded to the EU. Bulgaria and Romania formally joined the EU on 1 January 2007. In July 2006 a new Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) replaced previous funding programmes. The IPA funds aim to provide targeted assistance to candidate countries for membership of the EU and potential candidate countries; the IPA III runs in 2021-27. Croatia joined the EU on 1 July 2013. At early 2024 Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia were Central and South-Eastern European candidate countries for membership.

In November 2010 the European Commission agreed to introduce visa liberalization for Albania, with effect from mid-December. Albania formally became a candidate country in June 2014. In October 2018 the EU and Albania signed a co-operation agreement on border management between that country and the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (FRONTEX). In October 2019, at a meeting of the European Council, the leaders of France, Denmark and the Netherlands vetoed the opening of accession negotiations with Albania, and French President Emmanuel Macron also failed to support opening negotiations with North Macedonia. In March 2020, however, EU ministers reached political agreement on opening accession talks with the two nations, which was subsequently endorsed by the European Council. Nevertheless, the opening of negotiations was delayed, principally owing to a Bulgarian veto against North Macedonia over issues of national identity, although it was also considered that necessary reforms by Albania (in particular those relating to the functioning of the Constitutional Court and media legislation) remained unfulfilled. Accession negotiations with Albania finally opened on 19 July 2022.</p>

In November the application of the Community’s co-operation agreements with Yugo­slavia was suspended (with exemptions for the republics which co-operated in peace negotiations), and a trade embargo was imposed on Serbia and Montenegro in 1992.</p>
                    <p id="WB02048.IO.TXT.220" usage="ewyb edio casee">In July 1994 the EU Administration of Mostar was formally established to restore the administrative infrastructure of the city, situated in southern Bosnia and Herzegovina. The EU supported US-led efforts to negotiate peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which resulted in the Dayton accords of 1995, ending the conflict. In January 1996 the EU announced its intention to recognize the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY—Serbia and Montenegro).</p>
                    <p>In January 2003 a new EU Police Mission (EUPM) took over from the United Nations (UN) peacekeeping force in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in the first operation under the common European Security and Defence Policy. The EUPM was re-established in 2006 to support the police reform process and completed its mandate in June 2012. Meanwhile, in January 2004 the Bosnian Government issued a decree providing for the reunification of Mostar (divided between Croat- and Bosnian-controlled municipalities since 1993) into a single admin­istration, thereby fulfilling one of the major preconditions for the signature of an SAA. In December 7,000 troops (EUFOR) were deployed under EU command in Bosnia and Herzegovina, taking over from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), with a mission to ensure stability in the country; EUFOR was reduced in size in March 2007. An SAA with the EU was signed in June 2008 and entered into force in 2015. In November 2010 the European Commission agreed to introduce visa liberalization for Bosnia and Herzegovina, with effect from mid-December. Progress in meeting obligations for EU integration was slow, and the ruling parties failed to adopt constitutional amendments required by a 2009 ruling of the European Court of Human Rights. In late 2014 a new EU action plan was proposed, under which financial assistance would be released in exchange for commitments by all main political parties to significant reforms. In February 2015 both houses of the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina approved a statement committing the country to the programme of reforms. In mid-February 2016 Bosnia and Herzegovina formally submitted its application for membership of the EU and it was granted candidate status in December 2022, with the proviso that the country implement 14 `key priorities’ focusing on democracy and state functionality, the rule of law, administrative reform and fundamental rights. The European Council agreed in December 2023 to open accession negotiations with Bosnia and Herzegovina, once a degree of compliance with the criteria for membership had been reached. The EU Commission in March 2024 recommended the opening of accession negotiations with Bosnia and Herzegovina; the European Council endorsed the recommendation later in the same month.</p>
                    <p>An SAA was signed with Croatia in October 2001 and entered into force in February 2005. Meanwhile, in February 2003 Croatia submitted a formal application for membership of the EU. Planned accession talks with Croatia were postponed in March, owing to the failure of the Croatian authorities to demonstrate full co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). Negotiations were initiated in October. In December Gen. (retd) Ante Gotovina, who had been charged with war crimes against ethnic Serbs in 1995, was apprehended, thereby removing the main perceived obstacle to EU membership. A border dispute with Slovenia appeared to threaten progress towards membership from late 2008, but a subsequent referendum in Slovenia secured support for the resolution of the dispute by international arbitration. Croatia completed membership negotiations in mid-2011, and accession took place in mid-2013.</p>

          In December 1993 six member states of the EU formally recognized the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia (FYRM—now North Macedonia) as an independent state. Diplomatic recognition from the Community had been withheld in 1992, owing to pressure from the Greek Government, which feared that the existence of an independent Macedonia could imply a claim on the Greek province of the same name. In February 1994 Greece imposed a commercial embargo against the FYRM, on the grounds that the use of the name and symbols (e.g. on the state flag) of `Macedonia’ was a threat to Greek national security. In April the Commission commenced legal proceedings in the European Court of Justice against Greece. In September 1995 the FYRM agreed to change the design of its state flag, and in October Greece ended its economic blockade of the FYRM. A trade and co-operation agreement with the FYRM entered into force in January 1998. In April 2001 an SAA was signed with the FYRM and an interim agreement was adopted, providing for trade-related matters of the SAA to enter into effect in June. A NATO contingent in the FYRM was replaced by an EU-led mission on 31 March 20
          
          03; it was replaced in December by an EU police mission, Operation Proxima, the mandate of which expired at the end of 2005. The SAA entered into force in April 2004. A formal application for membership of the EU had been submitted in March, and the FYRM was granted candidate status in December 2005. In October 2009 the European Commission recommended that membership negotiations commence, but Greece objected to the initiation of negotiations while the dispute over the country’s name remained unresolved. In mid-December visa liberalization entered into force for travel within the Schengen area. Despite the FYRM’s dispute with Greece, in March 2012 the FYRM began a preliminary dialogue with the EU. However, a severe political crisis in the country from 2015 led to EU concern. In mid-2015 cross-party talks between the FYRM Government and opposition leaders, mediated by the European Commissioner responsible for European Neighbourhood Policy and Enlargement Negotiations, Johannes Hahn, resulted in an agreement to hold early legislative elections, although these were repeatedly postponed. A new accord was reached in July 2016 with the mediation of the EU and the USA; elections took place in December, and a new Government took office in May 2017. In July 2018 agreement was reached (subject to approval by a referendum in the FYRM and the legislatures of both sides) to rename the country as the `Republic of North Macedonia’; the new name was officially adopted in February 2019. The resolution of the long-term dispute with Greece removed the principal obstacle to EU accession; however, from November 2020 a bilateral dispute with Bulgaria continued to obstruct the opening of negotiations; a resolution was reached in July 2022, enabling accession talks to be launched with North Macedonia.

                    <p id="WB02048.IO.TXT.226">In 1998 the escalation of violence in the Serbian province of Kosovo (FRY), between Serbs and the ethnic Albanian majority, prompted the imposition of EU sanctions. Several EU countries participated in a NATO military offensive against Yugoslavia, which was initiated in March 1999 following the continued repression of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by Serbian forces. In September sanctions against Kosovo and Montenegro were eased. Following the election of a new administration in the FRY in late 2000, the EU withdrew most remaining sanctions against the FRY and pledged financial support.</p>
                    <p>
          In February 2008 the Assembly of Kosovo endorsed a declaration establishing the province as a sovereign state, independent from Serbia. A supervisory EU mission (the EU Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo—EULEX), with some 1,900 foreign personnel, became operational in 2008 (with full deployment from April 2009). EULEX assumed responsibility from the UN Mission in Kosovo for police and judicial functions in December 2008 (EULEX’s mandate was repeatedly extended, and was amended in June 2018 to remove its executive judicial function). In July 2010 the European Parliament (EP) adopted a resolution that reiterated its desire for all EU member states to recognize Kosovo’s independence, the legality of which was upheld by the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) later that month. Five EU member states (Cyprus, Greece, Romania, Slovakia and Spain) continue to withhold recognition of Kosovo as an independent state. Negotiations on an SAA commenced in late October, and were concluded in May 2014. The SAA entered into force in April 2016. In September 2018 the EP voted in favour of opening negotiations on liberalizing visa requirements for Kosovo; in December 2022 EP, Commission and Council representatives reached agreement on visa liberalization, which came into effect in January 2024.

           . Meanwhile, in February 2017 the EU had approved the appointment of 19 judges to serve at the new Kosovo Specialist Chambers, in The Hague, Netherlands, in order to investigate allegations of war crimes by former members of the Kosovo Liberation Army. In June 2023 the EU introduced sanctions against Kosovo, including reduced financial co-operation, following violent protests after local elections in northern areas of Kosovo.

                    <p id="WB02048.IO.TXT.228">Negoti­ations on an SAA between the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro (as the FRY became known in February 2003) and the EU commenced in November 2005, but were terminated in May 2006. The EU recognized Montenegrin independence in June. In June 2007 the President of the Commission invited Serbia to resume SAA negotiations, but in February they were again suspended. However, in late April EU ministers responsible for foreign affairs signed the SAA with Serbia, which was accompanied by a provisional document granting Serbia access to benefits based on the SAA before all EU members had ratified the Agreement; however, its implementation was suspended until EU member states agreed unanimously on Serbia’s full co-operation with the ICTY. In mid-December 2009 visa liberalization was implemented for Serbian citizens travelling within the Schengen area. In late December Serbia formally applied for membership of the EU, and in June 2010 the EU agreed to begin the ratification process for the SAA. EU heads of state and of government officially approved Serbia’s candidate status in March 2012 (following progress in dialogue between Serbian and Kosovo representatives in Brussels). In April 2013 EU-mediated talks in Brussels resulted in the signature of a provisional accord on the normalization of relations by the premiers of Serbia and Kosovo (the First Agreement of Principles Governing the Normalization of Relations). In June the European Council officially endorsed the opening of talks on EU accession with Serbia. The SAA entered into force in September 2013. Although accession negotiations with Serbia officially commenced in January 2014, negotiations on the first two of the 35 `chapters’ or policy areas to be discussed were only opened in December 2015.</p>
                    <p>Following the declaration of independence by Montenegro in June 2006, the Council pledged to develop the relationship of the EU with Montenegro as a sovereign state. The first Enhanced Permanent Dialogue meeting between Montenegro and the EU was held in the Montenegrin capital, Podgorica, in July, when the Council adopted a mandate for the negotiation of an SAA with Montenegro. In October 2007 Montenegro signed an SAA with the EU, which entered into force in May 2010. Meanwhile, Montenegro had applied for membership of the EU in December 2008. From December 2009 Montenegrin citizens were no longer required to hold a visa to travel within the Schengen area. In December 2010 Montenegro was formally granted the status of a candidate country for EU membership, and accession negotiations commenced in June 2012.</p>
                    <p>In February 2018 the Commission adopted a new strategy on enlargement to include, and increase its involvement in, the Western Balkans, as part of a larger initiative to strengthen the Union by 2025. The new Western Balkan strategy provided for six principal areas of engagement in 2018-20 to strengthen the rule of law; to develop increased co-operation on security and migration; further to support socioeconomic development; to expand the EU’s Energy Union into the region and to improve transport links; to improve telecommunications infrastructure and to reduce `roaming’ charges for mobile telephone use; and to promote reconciliation and positive relationships between neighbouring states. The Western Balkan strategy detailed the measures required for implementation by Montenegro and Serbia in order to secure accession by 2025, while emphasizing that there was potential for other nations to accelerate their progress towards EU membership. Notably, the Commission proposed implementing special arrangements in order to ensure that future member states from the region would not be able to block the accession of other Western Balkan candidate states. Annual EU-Western Balkans summits are held, most recently in Brussels in December 2023.</p>
                    <p usage="casee">In June 1995 the European Council endorsed a proposal by the Commission to reform and strengthen the EU’s Mediterranean policy. In November a conference of foreign affairs ministers of the EU member states and 11 Mediterranean non-member countries (including Albania) was convened in Barcelona, Spain. The conference resolved to establish a permanent Euro-Mediterranean ministerial dialogue, and issued the Barcelona Declaration, outlining the main objective of the partnership, which was to create a region of peace, security and prosperity. The process of co-operation and dialogue under this agreement became known as the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership (or Barcelona Process). A conference was convened in November 2000, in Marseille, France, which focused on the adoption of a new common strategy for the Mediterranean, aimed at strengthening the Barcelona Process, which was identified as having three main areas of co-operation: political dialogue; economic co-operation and free trade; and human, social and cultural dialogue. In March 2008 the European Council approved a proposal formally to transform the Barcelona Process into a Union for the Mediterranean (UfM), which was officially launched at the Paris Summit for the Mediterranean in July by heads of state and of government from the EU member states and from the member states and observers of the Barcelona Process. Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Monaco and Montenegro were also admitted to the UfM: Barcelona Process, which includes all of the EU member states together with an additional 16 regional states (North Macedonia joined in November 2022). The headquarters of the UfM opened in Barcelona in March 2010. In February 2021 the European Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy proposed a new Agenda for the Mediterranean to reinforce the strategic partnership between the EU and its Southern Neighbourhood, which was approved by the Council of the EU in April and focused on human development, governance and the rule of law; economic prosperity and digital transition; peace and security; migration; and climate resilience, energy and the environment.</p>

The EC established the Technical Assistance to the Commonwealth of Independent States (TACIS) programme, also in 1991, to promote the development of market economies and to foster democracy in the countries of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR)—and Mongolia. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania (now EU member states) withdrew from TACIS in 1992.

          In March 2003 the European Commission launched a European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) with the aim of enhancing co-operation with countries adjacent to the enlarged Union. A new European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) replaced TACIS and MEDA (which was concerned with EU co-operation with Medi­terranean countries) from 2007. All countries covered by the ENP (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine and several Mediterranean countries) were eligible for support under the ENPI. From 2014 the ENPI was replaced by the European Neighbourhood Instrument, and for the period 2021-27 several funding programmes were absorbed into the new Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument

        </p>
                    <p>In May 2009 the Governments of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine, and the EU issued a joint declaration on establishing an Eastern Partnership. The Eastern Partnership (facilitated through the ENP) aimed, through support for reforms in partner countries, to accelerate political association and further economic integration with the EU. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020-21, the EU provided funding in support of the health sector and in order to assist in the social and economic recovery of the countries of the Eastern Partnership.</p>
                    <p id="WB02048.IO.TXT.211" usage="ewyb edio eerca">In 1992 EU heads of government decided to replace the agreement on trade and economic co-operation that had been concluded with the USSR in 1989 with new Partnership and Co-operation Agreements (PCAs), providing a framework for closer political, cultural and economic relations between the EU and the former republics of the USSR. An Interim Agreement with the Russian Federation on trade came into effect in February 1996, and a PCA with Russia came into effect in December 1997. In June 1999 the EU adopted a Common Strategy on Russia, which aimed to promote the consolidation of democracy and the rule of law; the integration of Russia into the common European economic and social space; and regional stability and security. Relations with Russia were strained by its opposition to EU enlargement. In May 2004, at a bilateral summit held in the Russian capital, Moscow, the EU agreed to support Russia’s membership of the World Trade Organization, following Russia’s extension in April of its PCA with the EU to 10 accession states. Agreements on visa facilitation and on readmission were signed at an EU-Russia summit held in Sochi, Russia, in May 2006. In July the Commission approved draft negotiating directives for a new EU-Russia Agreement to replace the PCA, which expired in December 2007. No such agreement was concluded, and the PCA was renewed on an annual basis. However, regular bilateral talks with Russia were suspended from 2014, owing to Russia’s involvement in the conflict in eastern Ukraine—see below. Moreover, Russian military involvement in the Syrian Arab Republic from September 2015, as well as campaigns of disinformation, also resulted in increased tensions. The EU’s East StratCom Task Force was established in March of that year to combat Russian disinformation. Sanctions against Russia (see below) were repeatedly renewed. In February 2021 the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy visited Moscow, where talks were held on issues including the alleged state-sanctioned poisoning of Russian opposition figure Aleksei Navalnyi and his subsequent arrest; during the course of the visit, the expulsion of three EU diplomats from Russia was announced. In June the European Commission and the High Representative published a joint statement on EU-Russia relations, identifying its intention to `push back, constrain and engage with’ Russia, by responding to human rights violations and breaches of international law (through the imposition of restrictive measures if deemed appropriate), by countering attempts to undermine EU values, and by engaging with Russia where necessary, and in line with EU interests.</p>
                    <p id="WB02048.IO.TXT.213" usage="ewyb edio eerca">In February 1994 the EU Council of Ministers agreed to pursue closer economic and political relations with Ukraine, after it agreed to renounce control of nuclear weapons on its territory. A PCA came into effect in March 1998. In December 1999 the EU adopted a Common Strategy on Ukraine, aimed at developing a strategic partnership on the basis of the PCA. In November 2005 an EU Border Assistance Mission to monitor Ukraine’s border with Moldova was launched at the request of both countries’ Governments (although initially deployed for a period of two years, the mission is ongoing). An EU-Ukraine Association Agreement was initialled in March 2012, and a separate Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (DCFTA) was concluded in July. In November Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych decided to sign neither the Association Agreement nor the accompanying agreement on free trade, prompting large-scale protests in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, which continued into early 2014. In February EU ministers responsible for foreign affairs voted to impose sanctions against senior Ukrainian officials, after more than 75 people were reportedly killed by security forces during action to remove demonstrators from central Kyiv. After Yanukovych’s removal from office in February, in March EU ministers responsible for foreign affairs condemned the violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty by Russian armed forces, and in mid-March the EU imposed asset freezes and visa restrictions against senior Russian officials. The EU condemned a referendum held in the Ukrainian territory of Crimea in mid-March, the results of which supported its annexation by Russia, in contravention of the Ukrainian Constitution. The EU has maintained a non-recognition policy with respect to the annexation of Crimea by Russia.</p>
                    <p>In March 2014 the political provisions of the Association Agreement were signed by the EU and Ukraine; the remainder of the Agreement was signed in June, and parts of the agreement were provisionally applied in November. Meanwhile, in May EU ministers responsible for foreign affairs agreed to impose broader sanctions against those deemed to be threatening Ukrainian sovereignty. In June the Council agreed to establish a Common Security and Defence Policy mission, the EU Advisory Mission for Civilian Security Sector Reform. In July the EU expressed concern at the continuing violence in eastern Ukraine, and subsequently extended the scope of the restrictive measures in place against Russia. Further sanctions were adopted in late July, following the shooting down of a Malaysian Airlines aeroplane over Donetsk in mid-July, and in September. In January 2015 the European Commission offered lending worth some €1,800m. to Ukraine, in support of its programme of reforms. The DCFTA, which formed part of the Association Agreement signed in 2014, entered into effect from January 2016. The Association Agreement was finally ratified by the Netherlands (the last EU member state to do so) in May 2017, and in July the Council approved the deal with Ukraine, thereby permitting its full implementation from September.</p>

          A PCA with Belarus was signed in March 1995, but ratification by EU member states was suspended in February 1997. EU technical assistance programmes were also suspended, with the exception of aid programmes and those considered to be directly beneficial to the democratic process. Restrictive measures pertaining to Belarus were renewed in October 2012, October 2013 and October 2014. An EU-Belarus Human Rights Dialogue resumed, on an annual basis, in July 2015. In February 2016 the EU decided not to renew restrictive measures against 170 people and three companies, owing to the more positive political environment, although other sanctions, including an arms embargo, were retained. In January 2014 the EU and Belarus initiated negotiations on a visa facilitation and readmission agreement, which was signed in January 2020. It was partially suspended in November 2021. In February 2020 the restrictive measures in place against Belarus were renewed. In mid-August, following the contested re-election of President Alyaksandr Lukashenka and the subsequent violent suppression of protests, the European Council announced plans to impose sanctions on senior Belarusian officials. Sanctions were imposed in October, and strengthened in both November and December, with the introduction of a travel ban and the freezing of assets. Following the hijacking in Belarus of a passenger flight carrying opposition journalist Raman Pratasyevich in May 2021, and his subsequent arrest, the European Council banned Belarusian aircraft from EU airspace. New economic sanctions against Belarus were adopted by EU ministers in June. Sanctions were broadened in November, and new sanctions were imposed in December in response to human rights abuses and claims of the manipulation of migrants for political purposes (Belarus had been accused of purposefully sending migrants to the Baltic states and Poland as part of a `hybrid warfare’ campaign). Sanctions were renewed in February 2022, and new sanctions were imposed in March in response to Belarus’s role in facilitating the Russian invasion of Ukraine in late February. Sanctions were prolonged for a further year from February 2023, and were in February 2024 prolonged for a further year until February 2025; meanwhile, new sanctions were imposed in August 2023.

          At the beginning of February 2022, amid the build-up of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine, the Commission adopted a proposal on the provision of emergency assistance to Ukraine, providing for lending of up to €1,200m. to be disbursed in two equal instalments. After Russia launched large-scale military action on 24 February, the EU announced that it was to finance the purchase and delivery of weaponry and other equipment to Ukraine under the European Peace Facility (EPF), at a cost of some €450m., the first time that the EU had agreed to provide such military support to a country involved in conflict (funding to Ukraine under the EPF was subsequently substantially increased, and had reached some €6,100m. by the end of 2023). A European military assistance mission for Ukraine (EUMAM Ukraine) was established in October 2022 for an initial two-year period of operation. The EU had introduced sanctions against Russia on 23 February, when that country recognized the independence of Donestsk and Luhansk in the Donbas, and sanctions were progressively tightened over subsequent days. Flights by Russian carriers (including private jets) were banned, a number of Russian banks were removed from the SWIFT international payments system, and two Russian state-owned media providers were prohibited from operating in EU member states. Ukraine submitted an application for EU membership on 28 February, and Georgia and Moldova formally applied for membership on 3 March. In late June the European Council awarded candidate status to Moldova and Ukraine, and agreed in December 2023 to start accession negotiations with both countries. Candidate status was granted to Georgia in the same month. Meanwhile, in early April 2022 the Council condemned the reported murder of civilians by the Russian armed forces in Ukraine, and a fifth package of restrictive measures was introduced, which notably banned the import of Russian coal with effect from August. A sixth package of measures was adopted on 3 June, which, 
          <i>inter alia</i>
          , introduced a partial ban on the purchase and transport of crude oil from Russia over a period of six to eight months (imports by pipeline to member states that were geographically most dependent on Russian oil imports, such as Hungary, were temporarily exempted from the embargo). On 12 July the Council agreed to provide €1,000m. in macrofinancial assistance (MFA) to Ukraine; total MFA to Ukraine consequently totalled €2,200m. since the beginning of the conflict. A macrofinancial assistance plus (MFA+) instrument worth up to €18,000m. in highly concessional loans was proposed by the Commission in November, which would be disbursed in regular instalments during 2023 to assist Ukraine in the provision of essential public services and in the restoration of infrastructure (the first instalment of €3,000m. was disbursed in January)
          <!--https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_6699-->
           . Disbursements were to be conditional on Ukraine introducing institutional reforms. A new Ukraine Facility for the `recovery, reconstruction and modernisation of Ukraine’ was proposed by the Commission in June 2023, worth €50,000m. in grants and loans in 2024-27. Meanwhile, In late July the EU adopted a new `maintenance and alignment’ package of measures, reinforcing existing sanctions, and introducing a ban on Russian gold imports. The package emphasized that EU sanctions did not target trade in agricultural products between Russia and other non-EU states. Economic sanctions against Russia were renewed on 26 July for a further six months. Further packages of restrictive measures were introduced. In early October, 
          <i>inter alia, </i>
          additional restrictions on trade and services with Russia were outlined. In November the Council adopted a decision that would add the violation of restrictive measures to the list of `EU crimes’ in the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. On 3 December the EU agreed a price cap on Russian crude and petroleum oils of US $60 per barrel. A ninth package of sanctions was introduced in December, which included a ban on transactions with the Russian Regional Development Bank, the suspension of several Russian media providers’ broadcasting licenses in the EU and sanctions against a further 141 individuals and 49 entities (including certain banks and political parties). A 10th package of sanctions was introduced in February 2023 targeting trade and exports of technology. Also in February the EU, along with the Group of Seven industrialized countries and Australia, capped certain refined petroleum products such as diesel, gasoline and jet fuel from Russia at $100 per barrel, while fuel oil was capped at $45 per barrel. An 11th package of sanctions was introduced in June, targeting the circumvention of sanctions by third countries, and a 12th package of sanctions was agreed in December, including a ban on imports, purchases or transfers of diamonds from Russia, with effect from 1 March 2024.

          In July 1998 a PCA with Moldova entered into force. In September 2012 the Council removed sanctions previously imposed on the authorities in the disputed Transnistria region of Moldova, owing to progress made by the new political leadership in negotiations. PCAs with the majority of the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States had entered into force by 1 July 1999, with the exception of Belarus and Turkmenistan (with which a PCA was signed in 1998 but not ratified); a PCA with Tajikistan was signed in October 2004 and entered into force in January 2010. In mid-2013 the EU completed negotiations on DCFTAs with Armenia, Georgia and Moldova, as part of negotiations on new Association Agreements with those countries, which were intended to supersede their PCAs. In September the Armenian Government announced its intention to join a customs union, at that time comprising Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, and consequently the Association Agreement negotiated with that country was not initialled. In June 2014 Association Agreements, which provided for the gradual introduction of a DCFTA, were signed with Georgia and Moldova; the agreements fully entered into force in July 2016. An EU Partnership Mission in Moldova was launched, at the request of Moldova’s Government, in May 2023, to assist in the strengthening of the security sector in the country, including against threats such as cybersecurity and foreign information manipulation and interference

           . Meanwhile, a visa facilitation and readmission agreement with Georgia was concluded in 2011, and in 2013 three agreements were reached with Azerbaijan on visa facilitation, readmission and mobility. In February 2017 talks commenced with Azerbaijan with the aim of negotiating a new framework agreement to encourage increased political dialogue and co-operation. In November an EU-Armenia Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement was signed, which entered into force in March 2021. In January 2023 the Council agreed to establish a civilian European Union Mission in Armenia, initially for a two-year period, with the aim of contributing to stability in border areas and to EU mediation efforts between Armenia and Azerbaijan.

          In June 2007 the European Council adopted a Strategy for a New Partnership, which aimed to develop co-operation with Central Asia. In November 2013 the European Commission announced plans to provide funds worth some €1,000m. to Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan under its Development Co-operation Instrument for 2014-20. In December 2015 the EU and Kazakhstan signed an Enhanced PCA (EPCA). Negotiations on an EPCA with Kyrgyzstan commenced in December 2017, and the agreement was initialled in July 2019. Negotiations on an EPCA with Uzbekistan were initiated in November 2018 and were completed in July 2022. Negotiations on an EPCA with Tajikistan began in February 2023. In June 2019 the Council adopted conclusions on a new strategy for Central Asia, and endorsed a joint communication by the High Representative and the European Commission, entitled The EU and Central Asia: New Opportunities for a Stronger Partnership; together these set out a new framework for engagement with the region, with policy to focus on resilience, prosperity and regional co-operation.

It aims to address the specific challenges of the Baltic Sea, Arctic Sea and north-west Russian regions and to encourage co-operation with external states. At a Northern Dimension summit meeting held in Helsinki, Finland, in November 2006 the leaders of the EU, Iceland, Norway and Russia endorsed a new Policy Framework Document and Northern Dimension Political Declaration. Priorities were identified as: the environment; transport and logistics; health and social wellbeing; and culture. (Observer status was granted to Canada and the USA at that time.)

          The EU Baltic Sea region comprises eight countries (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Sweden). The EU’s first macro-regional strategy, the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region (EUSBSR), was approved by the European Council in 2009. The EUSBSR aims to provide a framework for improving environmental conditions in the region, helping transportation flows, and improving networks for energy and research and innovation, as well as aiding the development of cross-border competition. The EUSBSR’s current 2021-27 action plan focuses on three objectives: Save the Sea; connecting the region; and increasing prosperity. The Interreg Baltic Sea Region programme (which includes Norway) was adopted in mid-2022 with priority areas in climate change, water, `innovative societies’ and regional co-operation

                    <p id="WB02048.IO.TXT.231">The members of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) concluded bilateral free trade agreements with the European Economic Community and the European Coal and Steel Community during the 1970s. On 1 January 1984 the last tariff barriers were eliminated, thus establishing full free trade for industrial products between the European Communities and EFTA members. Some EFTA members subsequently applied for membership of the EC: Austria in 1989, Sweden in 1991, and Finland, Switzerland and Norway in 1992. Greenland withdrew from the EU in 1985, and subsequent relations were based on a special agreement. Formal negotiations on the creation of a European Economic Area (EEA), a single market for goods, services, capital and labour among EC and EFTA members, began in June 1990, and were concluded in October 1991. The agreement was signed in May 1992. In a referendum in December, Swiss voters rejected ratification of the agreement; the remaining 18 countries signed an adjustment protocol in March 1993, allowing the EEA to be established without Switzerland (which was given observer status). The EEA entered into force on 1 January 1994.</p>
                    <p>Formal negoti­ations on the accession to the EU of Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway were concluded in March 1994 and treaties of accession to the EU were signed by heads of government of the four countries in June. Accession to the EU was endorsed by the electorates of Austria, Finland and Sweden in June, October and November 1994, respectively. Norway’s accession, however, was rejected in a national referendum at the end of November. From 1994 Norway’s relations with the EU were based on full participation in the EEA as well as involvement (at non-signatory level) in the EU’s Schengen Agreement. Austria, Finland and Sweden became members of the EU on 1 January 1995. Liech­tenstein, which became a full member of EFTA in September 1991, joined the EEA on 1 May 1995.</p>
                    <p>In 1999 Switzerland signed seven bilateral free trade agreements with the EU, mainly relating to trade liberalization (known together as Bilateral I). The first EU-Switzerland summit meeting took place in Brussels in May 2004, after which nine sectoral agreements (Bilateral II) were signed by the two parties. The participation of Switzerland in the Schengen Agreement on border controls and the extension of the agreement on the free movement of persons to the 10 states that joined the EU in May 2004 were approved by Swiss voters in public referendums in June and September 2005. A protocol on these measures and on Bilateral II was signed in October 2004, entering into force in April 2006. In February 2014 voters narrowly approved proposals that the country should renegotiate its freedom of movement agreement with the EU (a request that was refused by the EU), and introduce quotas for immigrants. Switzerland duly failed to ratify an agreement extending free movement to Croatia, and in April announced that it would allow a limited number of Croatians to enter Switzerland by means of a new quota system. In June 2016 the Swiss legislature voted to terminate formally a long-dormant application by Switzerland—submitted in 1992—to accede to EU membership. In December 2016 Switzerland passed legislation to ensure that employment vacancies gave priority to Swiss-based job seekers, but did not introduce quotas for workers from EU member states. The Swiss Government also signed an agreement extending freedom of movement to Croatia from 1 January 2017. Negotiations between the EU and Switzerland took place over Switzerland’s future relationship with the Union. The EU sought Switzerland’s endorsement of a new framework agreement, to replace some 120 sectoral agreements hitherto in place, agreed when Swiss accession was still anticipated. A draft institutional framework agreement was announced in December 2018, providing for equivalence with EU law in key areas. Amid some popular opposition to requirements on freedom of movement, the Swiss Government came under pressure to organize a referendum on the issue. In a referendum held in Switzerland in September 2020, a majority of voters rejected ending the existing freedom of movement arrangements with the EU. Nevertheless, in May 2021 the Swiss Government failed to sign a new institutional framework agreement with the EU, and withdrew from the negotiations. In February 2022 the Swiss Government proposed to seek to improve bilateral relations with the EU by enhancing individual agreements rather than establishing an overarching mechanism; exploratory discussions have been held between both parties since March.</p>
                    <p id="WB02048.IO.TXT.25084">Iceland joined EFTA in 1970 and ratified the EEA in 1993 (although the extension of the single market legislation excluded agriculture and fisheries management, as in Norway and Liechtenstein). Iceland negotiated participation in the Schengen Agreement, which it implemented from March 2001 (although, as a signatory, it was not involved in decision making within the agreement). Amid an economic crisis in Iceland in 2008, in July 2009 the Icelandic Parliament voted in favour of making an application for membership of the EU. Accession negoti­ations with Iceland opened in July 2010. Public enthusiasm for membership subsequently lessened, however. In June 2013 Iceland suspended its negotiations on membership and in March 2015 the Government officially announced Iceland’s withdrawal from the accession process.</p>

          Following the UK’s official departure from the EU on 31 January 2020 (see 
          <i>The United Kingdom’s Decision to Leave the EU</i>
          ), a new EU delegation to the UK opened on 1 February, tasked with, 
          <i>inter alia,</i>
           monitoring the implementation of the negotiated withdrawal agreement between the two parties during the so-called transition period, due to expire at the end of 2020. An agreement on trade and co-operation between the EU and the UK was finally concluded on 24 December, provisionally coming into effect at the beginning of 2021; it formally entered into force on 1 May. In January the UK Government attracted controversy when it refused to award the EU’s diplomatic representation in the capital, London, full diplomatic status, a decision that was reversed in May. In March the Commission announced that it intended to launch legal action against the UK Government in response to its plans to extend unilaterally the waivers in place for businesses in Northern Ireland, which had allowed a limited, three-month, suspension of some of the trade rules pertaining to goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. (Under EU-UK trading arrangements, Northern Ireland, although part of the UK, had to adhere to EU single market regulations for goods.) Although the legal action was suspended in mid-2021, tensions over the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol governing trade relations between the EU and the UK continued. In June 2022 the UK Government announced plans to introduce new legislation to override areas of its agreement with the EU, by removing both checks on goods travelling into Northern Ireland (and not intended for export) and the European Court of Justice’s (ECJ) role in overseeing the implementation of the protocol; the EU declared the UK’s actions to be a violation of international law, and announced that it was to resume legal action. In February 2023 it was announced that an agreement in principle had been reached between the UK and the EU, known as the Windsor Framework, under which Northern Ireland would remain in the EU single market and the ECJ would retain final jurisdiction on EU law. The de facto border in the Irish Sea between Great Britain and Northern Ireland would be removed by the separation of goods arrivals destined for Northern Ireland (with minimal paperwork necessary) or for export to the Republic of Ireland. Notably, the Northern Ireland Assembly would have the power to request that the UK Government prevent changes to EU single market rules from applying to Northern Ireland under the `Stormont brake’ emergency mechanism. The UK rejoined the Horizon Europe (see 
          <i>Research and Innovation</i>
          ) programme in January 2024 as an associated country.

          ). Accession talks began in October 2005. In October 2015 a Joint Action Plan was agreed between the European Commission and Turkey in order to ameliorate co-operation in responding to the migration crisis, caused, in particular, by the ongoing civil conflict in Syria. In March 2016 a new agreement was reached, known as the EU-Turkey Statement, providing for the return of migrants crossing into Greek territory and considered not to be in immediate need of international protection (see 
          <i>Justice, Migration and Home Affairs</i>
          ). EU-Turkey relations were strained by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s uncompromising stance following a coup attempt in July of that year. Members of the EP (MEPs) have adopted several non-binding resolutions urging membership negotiations to be suspended, including in July 2017, March 2019 and May 2021. Relations with the EU were further strained after Turkey suspended application of the 2016 EU-Turkey
          
           agreement in February 2020, announcing that it would open the passage for migrants to cross its borders with Europe (following an upsurge in fighting in Syria, which caused the deaths of more than 30 Turkish soldiers). In March 2021 the European Council indicated its readiness to re-engage with Turkey on issues including an updated customs union, the resumption of high-level dialogue and increased co-operation in managing migration. In March 2023 the European Commission announced reconstruction aid to Türkiye of €1,000m. and humanitarian aid to Syria of €108m., following devastating earthquakes in those countries in February.

          Co-operation agreements concluded in the 1970s with the Maghreb countries (Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia), the Mashreq countries (Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria) and Israel covered free access to the community market for industrial products, customs preferences for certain agricultural products, and financial aid in the form of grants and loans from the European Investment Bank (EIB). In June 1992 the EC approved a proposal to conclude new bilateral agreements with the Maghreb countries, incorporating: political dialogue; financial, economic, technical and cultural co-operation; and the eventual establishment of a free trade area. An Association Agreement with Tunisia was signed in July 1995 and entered into force in March 1998. A similar agreement with Morocco (concluded in 1996) entered into force in March 2000. In March 1997 negotiations were initiated with Algeria on an Association Agreement that would incorporate political commitments relating to democracy and human rights; this was signed in December 2001 and entered into force in September 2005. An Association Agreement with Jordan was signed in November 1997 and entered into force in May 2002. The so-called

An interim EU Association Agreement with Lebanon was signed in June 2002, and entered into force in April 2006. Protracted negotiations on an Association Agreement with Syria were concluded in October 2004. A revised version of the Agreement was initialled in December 2008. In May 2011 the EU announced that co-operation with Syria was to be suspended, owing to the violent suppression of anti-Government protests there from March (and subsequent civil conflict—see below). In December the Council of the EU agreed that negotiations could commence towards Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreements (DCFTAs) with Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia. Negotiations with Morocco were initiated in March 2013 but were later suspended; talks with Tunisia commenced in October 2015.

          The EU formed part of the Middle East Quartet (alongside the UN, the USA and the Russian Federation), which was established in July 2002 to mediate between Israel and the Palestinian Territories. An EU Police Mission for the Palestinian Territories commenced operations in January 2006, with an initial three-year mandate, subsequently repeatedly extended, to support the PA in establishing sustainable and effective policing arrangements. In February 2008 the European Commission launched a new mechanism, PEGASE, to support activities in four principal areas: governance (including fiscal reform, security and the rule of law); social development (including social protection, health and education); economic and private sector development; and development of public infrastructure (in areas such as water, the environment and energy). In October 2023, shortly after terrorist attacks perpetrated by the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) in Israel, the European Council condemned Hamas and its acts `in the strongest possible terms’, and emphasized Israel’s `right to defend itself in line with humanitarian and international law’. However, the EU member states struggled to adopt a common position on the Israel-Hamas conflict: at a vote calling for a humanitarian ceasefire held in the UN General Assembly in December, 17 EU member states voted in favour, while two voted against and the remainder abstained. In October the Commission announced that current humanitarian aid to Gaza would increase from €25m. to more than €75m. In January 2024 a non-binding resolution by the EP called for a permanent ceasefire (as long as all hostages taken by Hamas were immediately released and Hamas itself was dismantled).

          During 2002 attempts were made to improve relations with Iran, as negotiations began in preparation for a Trade and Co-operation Agreement. In mid-2003 the EU (in conformity with US policy) warned Iran to accept stringent new nuclear inspections, and threatened the country with economic repercussions unless it restored international trust in its nuclear programme. A comprehensive dialogue between the EU and Iran was suspended by Iran in December 2003. In January 2005 the EU resumed trade talks with Iran after the Iranian authorities agreed to suspend uranium enrichment. However, these talks were halted in August, following Iran’s resumption of uranium conversion to gas (the stage preceding enrichment). Following Iran’s removal of international seals from a nuclear research facility in January 2006, the EU supported efforts to refer Iran to the UN Security Council. In December the Council criticized the country’s failure to implement measures required by both the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the UN Security Council in respect of its nuclear programme. EU trade sanctions against Iran were strengthened in August 2008, after Iran failed to halt its uranium enrichment programme. In July 2010 EU ministers responsible for foreign affairs adopted a new set of sanctions, prohibiting investment, technical assistance and technology transfers to Iran’s energy sector, and also targeting the country’s financial services, insurance and transport sectors. Sanctions were strengthened in 2011 and 2012. In November 2013 negoti­ations commenced between the E3/EU+3 grouping (comprising the People’s Republic of China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the USA, and led by the EU’s High Representative) and Iran, with the aim of concluding a comprehensive solution to ensure the long-term safety of Iran’s nuclear programme. In July 2015 agreement on a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) was reached between Iran and the E3/EU+3, which sought to guarantee the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme. The JCPOA was implemented from January 2016, thereby enabling the EU, the UN and the USA to lift their nuclear-related financial sanctions. However, in May 2018 President Trump announced the USA’s withdrawal from the agreement and the reimposition of sanctions. The EU remained committed to the implementation of the JCPOA, but the US sanctions had strained relations with Iran, and Iran had breached the agreement. Negotiations with Iran, with the indirect participation of the USA, resumed in April 2021. In August 2022 the EU presented a new, draft agreement to Iran for consideration. Following the repression by Iranian security forces of widespread protests in Iran after the death of a woman in late 2022 who had been arrested for not wearing a 
          <i>hijab </i>
          (headscarf) in accordance with government rules, the EU extended sanctions to a number of individuals and entities, including Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting. The imposition of sanctions against individuals and organizations in relation to human rights violations in Iran and Iran’s military support of Russia in its war against Ukraine continued during 2023.

          An Association Agreement with Egypt was signed in June 2001 and ratified in June 2004. In August 2013, following the escalation of violence in Egypt in that month, EU ministers responsible for foreign affairs agreed to suspend the sale of armaments to the country. The Association Council of the EU and Egypt met in Luxembourg in June 2022, and new Partnership Priorities were adopted for the period until 2027. The EU and Egypt pledged to enhance dialogue and co-operation in three priority areas: the sustainable modern economy and social development, foreign policy, and stability. A Memorandum of Understanding on renewable hydrogen co-operation was signed between the EU and Egypt in November 2022. In June 2023 the EU allocated funding to Egypt amounting to some €20m. to help the country to assist refugees from Sudan. The EU and Egypt agreed in March 2024 to elevate the Association Agreement to a Strategic and Comprehensive Partnership.

          In July 1998 an EU-Yemen co-operation agreement entered into force, focusing on development and economic issues. After the security and humanitarian situation in Yemen deteriorated in 2015, the EU increased its provision of humanitarian aid to the country. The EU delegation to Yemen was evacuated and since 2017 has been based in Amman, Jordan. The EU allocated some €145m. in humanitarian aid to assist the population during the ongoing conflict and famine in 2023. In January 2024 it was proposed that an EU mission in the Red Sea be established to protect commercial vessels, following attacks by Yemen-based Houthi (Ansar Allah—Supporters of God) rebels on commercial vessels in the Red Sea area; EUNAVFOR ASPIDES was launched in February.

                    <p>Formal negotiations on an EU-Libya Framework Agreement began in November 2008. Negotiations were suspended in February 2011, when violent clashes broke out in Libya between anti-Government protesters and armed forces loyal to the Libyan leader, Col Muammar al-Qaddafi. Later that month the Council adopted a UN Security Council Resolution prohibiting the sale to Libya of arms and ammunition, and agreed to impose additional sanctions against those responsible for the violent repression of civilian protests. The Council also imposed a visa ban on several people, including al-Qaddafi and members of his family, and froze the assets of al-Qaddafi and 25 other people. After Qaddafi’s killing in October, the European Council agreed measures to support the Libyan economy and to assist the UN mission in Libya. A number of frozen assets were released in support of humanitarian and civilian needs, and a ban on the use of European airspace by Libyan aircraft was removed. In November the EU’s Tripoli office (opened in August) became the headquarters of a new EU delegation to Libya. In May 2013 a civilian EU Border Assistance Mission (EUBAM) was launched to help to improve border security. By July 2014, however, the security situation in Tripoli had deteriorated and the EU delegation and EUBAM left the country. The EU participated in the Berlin Conference of January 2020 to support UN efforts seeking a peaceful resolution of the continuing crisis in Libya. In March a new Mediterranean naval mission, EU NAVFOR MED IRINI, was launched to enforce the UN arms embargo on Libya.</p>
                    <p>In response to the forcible quashing, from March 2011, of anti-Government protests by the Syrian authorities, the EU imposed a number of restrictive measures, including an arms embargo and targeted sanctions, comprising a travel ban and the freezing of assets, against those deemed to be responsible for, or involved with, the repression. By August 2012 the EU had imposed 17 sets of sanctions on the Syrian authorities; sanctions were repeatedly extended. The EU delegation to Syria closed in December, owing to security concerns. In August the High Representative expressed deep concern at reports of the use of chemical weapons in Syria, and in February 2014 the EU pledged €12m. to help to dismantle and destroy stockpiles of chemical weaponry in Syria. An EU Strategy for Syria was adopted in April 2017, and in April 2018 the EU co-chaired, with the UN, the second Brussels Conference on Supporting the Future of Syria and the Region (the first having been convened in the previous year); the seventh such conference took place in June 2023. The EU, collectively, has been the most significant provider of international aid to Syria throughout the conflict. In 2023 €186.5m. was allocated by the Commission to humanitarian aid in Syria.</p>
                    <p id="WB02048.IO.TXT.2051">The increased tension in the Middle East prior to the military action in Iraq in March 2003 strained relations between member states of the EU. In February 2003 the European Council held an extraordinary meeting to discuss the crisis in Iraq, and issued a statement reiterating its commitment to the central role of the UN in maintaining international order. In April, however, the EU leaders accepted a dominant role for the USA and the UK in post-war Iraq, and Denmark, Spain and the Netherlands announced plans to send peacekeeping troops to Iraq. An EU integrated rule of law mission for Iraq commenced operations in July, with an initial mandate of 12 months. The EU provided €933m. in reconstruction and humanitarian assistance to Iraq in 2003-08. In November 2017 a civilian EU advisory mission to Iraq commenced operations in the capital, Baghdad, in order to support the Government in implementing reforms to the security sector.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, in August 2014 the European Council expressed dismay at the worsening security situation in Iraq and Syria, caused by the declaration of an Islamic caliphate over parts of the two countries’ territories by Islamic State (IS—formerly known as Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant), and the widespread human rights violations carried out against Christians and other minorities. The European Council noted that the outbreak of civil conflict in Syria had facilitated the emergence of IS, which it recognized as a threat to security in Europe, and announced its intention to co-operate with the USA and other countries in order to counter the threat posed by IS and other organizations deemed to pose a terrorist threat. A comprehensive EU regional strategy for Syria, Iraq and the threat from IS was adopted by the Council in April 2017.</p>
                    <p>In January 2018 the EU adopted a new strategy for Iraq, to support the country following the territorial defeat of IS, by supporting the country in the principal areas of territorial integrity, and ethnic and religious diversity; efforts towards the introduction and maintenance of stable and democratic government; humanitarian need; economic growth and job creation; transitional justice; and the introduction of a formal dialogue on migration. A PCA with Iraq, was signed in May 2012 and entered into force in August 2018. In September 2020 the EU signed a financing agreement with the Government of Iraq, pledging some €90m. in support of stability and the country’s socioeconomic recovery and development amid the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

(Previously, the principal means of co-operation between the EC and developing countries were the Lomé Conventions concluded in 1975-89.) A financial protocol attached to the Cotonou Agreement indicated the funds available to the ACP through the European Development Fund (EDF), the main instrument for EU aid for development co-operation in ACP countries. A revised agreement was signed in mid-2005, providing for free trade arrangements with the most developed ACP countries.

          Meanwhile, the first summit representing the institutionalization of Africa-EU dialogue was convened in April 2000, in Cairo, Egypt. At the second Africa-EU summit, held in December 2007 in Lisbon, Portugal, a Joint Africa-EU Strategy was adopted, providing a long-term framework for future political co-operation. At the fourth Africa-EU summit, held in Brussels in April 2014, a political declaration was adopted by heads of state and of government. The action plan for 2014-20 identified five strategic areas of focus: peace and security; democracy, good governance and human rights; human development; sustainable and inclusive development, together with growth and continental integration; and global and emerging issues. Joint Annual Forums were to be introduced, and the summit also adopted a declaration on migration and mobility, and plans, 
          <i>inter alia</i>
          , to combat illegal migration and human trafficking and to improve international protection. In August the EU launched a Pan-African Programme, which was allocated a budget of €845m. for 2014-20, to facilitate implementation of the Joint Africa-EU Strategy. In November 2017 the fifth Africa-EU summit was held in Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire. A declaration was adopted establishing joint priorities in four principal areas: investment in people through education and training; strengthening resilience, peace, security and governance; mobility and migration; and economic investment. A country-specific External Investment Plan sought to promote investment in African states to stimulate growth and employment, and to combat irregular migration. A joint statement was also adopted on human rights in Libya, condemning the treatment of migrants and refugees by criminal organizations. In March 2020 the Commission proposed a new Comprehensive Strategy with Africa, based on five priority areas: a partnership for green transition and energy access; a partnership for digital transformation; a partnership for sustainable growth and jobs; a partnership for peace and security governance; and a partnership on migration and mobility. The sixth EU-Africa summit took place in Brussels in February 2022, following delays resulting from the COVID-19 crisis. EU and African Union leaders agreed on a new Joint Vision for 2030, supported by the Global Gateway Africa-Europe Investment Package, totalling some €150,000m.

The EU also maintains several missions in Africa. Operation EU NAVFOR Somalia was established in 2008 in support of UN Security Council resolutions aimed at deterring and repressing acts of piracy and armed robbery in waters off the coast of Somalia, and protecting vulnerable vessels in that area. In February 2010 the Council established the EU Training Mission for Somalia (EUTM Somalia). The establishment of EUCAP Sahel Niger was approved by the Council in July 2012, as a training, advisory and assistance mission aimed at augmenting the capacity of Niger’s security forces to combat terrorism and organized crime; a military partnership mission (EUMPM) was established in December 2022.

           In July 2012 EUCAP Nestor (now EUCAP Somalia) was established to support the rule of law in Somalia and the maritime capacity of Djibouti, Kenya, Seychelles and Tanzania, complementing the EU’s anti-piracy naval force Operation ATALANTA (EU NAVFOR Somalia) and EUTM Somalia. EUTM Mali was launched in February 2013 to increase the military efficacy of that country’s armed forces, in an effort to facilitate the restoration of Mali’s territorial integrity, under civilian leadership. In April 2014 a civilian mission, EUCAP Sahel Mali, was established to help to support the security situation in Mali. In April 2016 the Council agreed to dispatch a military training mission to the Central African Republic (CAR), known as EUTM RCA; the EU suspended the work of EUTM RCA in the CAR in December 2021 amid concerns that mercenaries employed by a Russian private contractor, the Wagner Group, and accused of human rights violations were working closely with CAR military forces. EUTM Mali and EUCAP Sahel Mali were partially suspended in April 2022, however, an adapted EUCAP Sahel Mali was extended in January 2023 until 31 January 2025. Meanwhile, a military training mission in Mozambique (EUTM Mozambique) was established in October 2021.

At the fourth EU-Latin America/Caribbean (EU-LAC) summit, held in Vienna, Austria, in May 2006, it was decided to initiate negoti­ations for Association Agreements with Central America and with the Andean Community. The meeting also endorsed a proposal to establish an EU-Latin America parliamentary assembly, which met for the first time in November. In 2007 the EU concluded negotiations for an Economic Partnership Agreement with the Caribbean Forum (CARIFORUM) grouping of 16 states, which was signed in October 2008. In March 2010 a trade agreement was reached between the EU and Colombia and Peru. It was signed in June 2012, and entered into provisional effect from 2013. Ecuador’s accession to the trade agreement took provisional effect from the beginning of 2017. Meanwhile, in May 2010 the EU concluded negotiations on an Association Agreement with Central America (covering Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama), in the areas of trade, political dialogue and co-operation. The Association Agreement was signed in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, in June 2012, and was provisionally implemented during the second half of 2013.</p>

The first EU-CELAC summit meeting took place in Santiago, Chile, in January 2013. In June the EU and the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States established diplomatic relations. In May 2014 a new EU-Central America Political Dialogue and Co-operation Agreement entered into effect, pending ratification of the Association Agreement (the trade element of which had already come into effect). In November 2012 the Council had endorsed a Joint Caribbean-EU Partnership Strategy, which was conceived at an EU-CARIFORUM summit held in Madrid, Spain, in May 2010. The second EU-CELAC (and the eighth EU-LAC) summit was held in Brussels in June 2015. Following a meeting in October 2020 of EU and CELAC senior officials for science and technology, in July 2021 a strategic roadmap for 2021-23 was approved by the EU. An EU-CELAC summit was held in Brussels in July 2023; at the end of the summit a declaration was adopted by all participating countries with the exception of one CELAC country, which disagreed with a section of the text dealing with the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.

          An EU legation office opened in the Cuban capital, Havana, in March 2003, and the EU supported a renewed application by Cuba to join the successor to the Lomé Convention, the Cotonou Agreement. However, the imprisonment of dissidents by the Cuban regime in April led the EU to downgrade diplomatic relations with Cuba. In May Cuba withdrew its application for membership of the Cotonou Agreement, and in July it announced that it would not accept aid from the EU and would terminate all political contact with the organization. In January 2005 Cuba restored diplomatic ties with EU states. At the end of that month the EU temporarily suspended the diplomatic sanctions imposed on Cuba in mid-2003 and announced its intention to resume a `constructive dialogue’ with the Cuban authorities. The EU extended the temporary suspension of diplomatic sanctions against Cuba for one year in June 2005, and annually thereafter. Sanctions were lifted in June 2008, subject to an annual review. In August 2014 a National Indicative Programme for Cuba was adopted, making available €50m. for 2014-20 in order to address sustainable agriculture and food security; environmental issues; and sustainable economic and social development. Projects in 2021-27 were to focus on the Cuban economy; energy; sustainability; communications technology; and development co-operation and access to COVID-19 vaccines

           were based on a Co-operation Agreement of 1980. In May 1995 ASEAN and EU senior officials endorsed an initiative to convene an Asia-Europe meeting of heads of government (ASEM), which usually takes place every two years. The first ASEM summit was held in March 1996 in Bangkok, Thailand. In March 2007, at an EU-ASEAN ministerial meeting held in Nuremberg, Germany, ASEAN and the EU made the Nuremberg Declaration on an EU-ASEAN Enhanced Partnership. In April 2012 the Bandar Seri Begawan Plan of Action was adopted by both sides, with the objective of strengthening the Enhanced Partnership in 2013-17. In July 2012 the EU acceded to the ASEAN Treaty of Amity and Co-operation. In July 2014 the EU and ASEAN agreed to strengthen co-operation through the establishment of a strategic partnership, focusing on connectivity; maritime security; and development co-operation. In July 2016 the 11th ASEM was held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, and addressed the theme `20 Years of ASEM: Partnership for the Future through Connectivity’. An ASEAN-EU Plan of Action for 2018-22 was adopted in August 2017. The 12th ASEM summit took place in Brussels in October 2018; efforts were under way to enhance connectivity between the two regions, by means of investment in infrastructure, exchange programmes, trade and digital projects. In December 2020 engagement between the EU and ASEAN was formally elevated to the status of a `strategic partnership’ (rather than the previous `dialogue’). In June 2021 the EU and ASEAN concluded negotiations on an ASEAN-EU Comprehensive Air Transport Agreement, the first `bloc-to-bloc’ aviation accord, which was expected to improve air transport connections between the two regions. The 13th ASEM summit was held via video conference from Phnom Penh, Cambodia, in November 2021, with the theme of `strengthening multilateralism for shared growth’. Discussions focused on the post-pandemic socioeconomic recovery, environmental issues and strengthening co-operation in foreign and security policy.

                    <p id="WB02048.IO.TXT.253">A trade agreement was signed with the People’s Republic of China in 1978 and renewed in May 1985. In June 1989, following the violent repression of the Chinese pro-democracy movement by the Chinese Government, the EC imposed economic sanctions and an embargo on arms sales to that country. In October 1990 it was decided that relations with China should be progressively normal­ized. The EU has supported China’s increased involvement in the international community and, in par­ticular, supported its application for membership of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The first EU-China meeting of heads of government was convened in April 1998. A bilateral trade agreement between the EU and China was concluded in May 2000, removing a major barrier to China’s accession to the WTO; this was approved in November 2001. In 2003 an EU-China comprehensive strategic partnership was established. At a summit meeting with China, held in Beijing in November 2013, the EU-China 2020 Strategic Agenda for Co-operation was adopted. Talks were initiated in 2014 with the aim of concluding a comprehensive EU-China Investment Agreement. A new EU-China Connectivity Platform was created in 2015, to facilitate co-operation in infrastructure. In June 2016 the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the European Commission adopted a new five-year strategy for the EU’s relationship with China, which was updated in March 2019. In response to the emergence of COVID-19 in China in late 2019, the EU co-ordinated the provision of personal protective equipment and medical supplies to China; China reciprocated when the virus spread throughout Europe during the first half of 2020. In December 2020 the EU and China adopted a new 2020 Strategic Agenda for Cooperation, and negotiations were concluded on the proposed EU-China Investment Agreement, which was due to come into force following ratification by both sides. However, in March 2021, amid claims that the human rights of Uighur Muslims in China were being abused, EU Ministers of Foreign Affairs agreed to impose travel bans and asset freezes on four individuals, in what were the first EU sanctions against China since 1989. In May 2021 the European Parliament (EP) voted to suspend the ratification of the agreement with China, after China imposed retaliatory sanctions on several EU officials. In September the EP adopted a report identifying areas of focus for a new EU strategy of engagement with China, including co-operation on common global challenges (including future pandemics and an independent investigation into the origin of COVID-19, addressing violations of human rights and combating disinformation). An EU-China summit took place via video link at the beginning of April 2022. The EU urged China (which has a close relationship with the Russian Federation) to support efforts to end the conflict in Ukraine, following Russia’s invasion of that country on 24 February.</p>

A framework agreement on trade and co-operation between the EU and the Republic of Korea (South Korea) entered into force in April 2001. In May 2007 the EU and South Korea commenced negotiations towards the adoption of a free trade agreement. The deal, which provided for the elimination of almost all duties in the agricultural and industrial sectors, was signed at an EU-South Korea summit meeting held in Brussels in October 2010 and entered into force in July 2011; it was formally ratified in December 2015. Meanwhile, in May 2010 the EU and South Korea signed a new framework agreement on bilateral relations, which entered into force in June 2014. At a summit meeting in October 2010 the EU and South Korea also agreed further to strengthen their relationship, by forming a strategic partnership. A bilateral agreement on South Korea’s participation in EU crisis management operations entered into effect in December 2016, supplementing the strategic partnership.</p>
                    <p>In September 1999, for the first time, ministerial-level discussions took place between the EU and North Korea at the UN General Assembly. In May 2001 the EU announced that it was to establish diplomatic relations with North Korea to facilitate efforts in support of reconciliation in the Korean Peninsula and, in particular, in support of economic reform and the easing of the acute food and health problems in North Korea. However, the implementation of a Country Strategy Paper, adopted in March 2002, was suspended. In October the EU expressed its deep concern after North Korea admitted that it had conducted a clandestine nuclear weapons programme, in serious breach of the country’s international non-proliferation commitments. In response to North Korea’s announcement in October 2006 that it had conducted a nuclear test, the EU condemned the action and urged North Korea to abandon its nuclear programme. In April 2009 the EU strongly condemned North Korea for launching a rocket in contravention of UN Security Council resolutions. In December 2010 the Council reinforced sanctions in place against a number of individuals and entities in North Korea. Sanctions were subsequently strengthened between 2013 and 2018, and remain in place. The EU has implemented a policy of Critical Engagement in its relations with North Korea, combining the imposition of sanctions with efforts to remain open to dialogue in pursuit of full denuclearization.</p>

A co-operation accord with Viet Nam entered into force in June 1996. In October 2004 the EU and Viet Nam concluded a bilateral agreement on market access in preparation for Viet Nam’s accession to the WTO, which took place in January 2007. In June 2012 a PCA was signed, and it entered into force in 2016. At the end of June 2019 a free trade agreement and an investment protection agreement were signed in Hanoi, Viet Nam. The free trade agreement entered into force in August 2020. A PCA between the EU and Singapore was initialled in October 2013. An EU-Singapore free trade agreement and investment protection agreement were signed in October 2018; the free trade agreement entered into force in November 2019. In December 2022 the EU and Singapore concluded negotiations on a new EU-Singapore Digital Partnership, to strengthen bilateral digital trade.</p>

In February 2020 the EU announced that it was partially to suspend trade preferences for Cambodia, in response to the deteriorating human rights situation there. In September 1999 the EU briefly imposed an arms embargo against Indonesia, which was at that time refusing to permit the deployment of an international peacekeeping force in East Timor (now Timor-Leste). In April 2005 the EU extended preferential trade conditions to Indonesia. In November 2009 an EU-Indonesia PCA was signed; it entered into force in May 2014. A Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement with Indonesia was concluded in 2018; it entered into force in November 2021.</p>
                    <p>In October 1996 the EU imposed strict limits on entry visas for officials from Myanmar, owing to its refusal to allow the Commission to send a mission to the country to investigate allegations of forced labour. The EU successively extended its ban on arms exports to Myanmar and its prohibition on the issuing of visas. Sanctions were extended in 2003-04. In August 2009 sanctions were extended to the Myanmar judiciary. In September 2010 the European Commission adopted a proposal that Myanmar’s special trade privileges under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), which had been revoked in 1997, should be restored; this took effect in July 2013. Meanwhile, in April EU ministers responsible for foreign affairs had agreed formally to remove all sanctions (with the exception of those relating to military issues). However, in June 2018 the Council imposed sanctions against seven senior members of the military and security forces, who were accused of perpetrating atrocities against the Rohingya Muslim population. In March 2020 the EU announced funding of €31m. to help those affected by the Rohingya crisis in both Myanmar and Bangladesh. In February 2021 the EU condemned the military coup in Myanmar.</p>

In March 2016 an EU-India summit meeting was held in Brussels, and an EU-India Agenda for Action 2020 was endorsed, establishing a five-year roadmap for engagement; both sides agreed to make efforts towards negotiating a bilateral agreement on trade and investment. In November 2018 the EU adopted a new strategy on India, which sought to strengthen co-operation with that country, in the context of the strategic partnership between the two sides. A further EU-India summit took place online in July 2020; a new roadmap on the EU-India strategic partnership was adopted, to guide and strengthen bilateral co-operation until 2025. An EU-India High-Level Dialogue on Trade and Investment was initiated in February 2021. At a summit held in Porto, Portugal, in May, the EU and India agreed to resume talks on the negotiation of both a trade agreement and to launch negotiations on a separate investment protection agreement; negotiations began in June 2022. In February 2023 an EU-India Trade and Technology Council was established. In September 2021 the European Commission published a new EU strategy for increased co-operation in the Indo-Pacific region, including India.</p>
                    <p>A new accord with Sri Lanka entered into force in 1995. In August 2010 the EU temporarily withheld certain trade preferences for Sri Lanka, after an investigation confirmed that three UN conventions relating to human rights had failed to be implemented fully. In November 2015 the EU welcomed the progress made in Sri Lanka towards democracy and the country’s increased engagement with the international community, although in mid-2021 the European Parliament (EP) expressed concerns about reports of increasing human rights violations in Sri Lanka. The EU has provided support for democracy and peace in Nepal, which formally abolished the monarchy in May 2008. Co-operation focused on three principal areas: education; stability and peacebuilding; and trade and strengthening of economic capacity building. In 2024-25 the EU allocated humanitarian assistance totalling some €4m. to Nepal to assist its response to natural hazards and for disaster preparedness; by that time, humanitarian funding to Nepal since 2001 had reached some €124m. The EU and Nepal agreed a Multi-annual Indicative Programme for 2021-27, supporting development objectives under the country’s National Development Plan.</p>

          A draft co-operation agreement was initialled with Pakistan in April 1998, however, this was suspended following a military coup in October 1999. Political dialogue with Pakistan recommenced on an ad hoc basis in November 2000; the co-operation agreement was signed in November 2001 and entered into force in April 2004. The first EU-Pakistan summit was held in June 2009. In March 2012 the EU and Pakistan endorsed a five-year EU-Pakistan engagement plan, which aimed to promote peace and stability in the region. An EU-Pakistan strategic engagement plan was signed in June 2019, providing a comprehensive framework for political co-operation in the areas of,

          A co-operation accord with Bangladesh (replacing a 1976 agreement) was signed in May 2000 and came into force in March 2001. The EU pledged development aid worth up to €690m. to Bangladesh during 2014-20. In August 2020 the EU provided emergency aid amounting to some €100,000 to Bangladesh, in response to severe floods that had affected almost one-third of the country. In October 2021 the EU and Bangladesh agreed to launch a new political dialogue during 2022, the first being held in November in Dhaka, Bangladesh, at which the EU offered to begin discussions on a partnership co-operation agreement.

          The EU pledged assistance for the reconstruction of Afghanistan following the removal of the Taliban regime in late 2001
          
          . In November 2005 the EU and Afghanistan adopted a joint declaration on a new partnership aimed at promoting Afghanistan’s political and economic development and strengthening EU-Afghan relations. The EU pledged €1,030m. in development assistance to Afghanistan during 2007-13. Assistance provided by the EU focused on the principal areas of concern identified in the National Development Strategy for Afghanistan, adopted in mid-2008, which included strengthening the judicial system; rural development, to combat narcotics production by promoting alternatives to poppy cultivation; and supporting the health sector. In October 2009 a Plan for Enhanced EU Engagement in Afghanistan and Pakistan was approved by EU ministers responsible for foreign affairs. In June 2014 a new strategy for engagement with Afghanistan until the end of 2016 was agreed, which focused on strengthening Afghanistan’s institutions. In October 2016 the Brussels Conference on Afghanistan was held, at which the EU agreed its first statebuilding contract for Afghanistan, providing direct budgetary support for the Government, in the context of a new Afghanistan National Peace and Development Framework. In February 2017 a Co-operation Agreement on Partnership and Development (CAPD) was signed in Munich, Germany, by the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the Minister of Finance of Afghanistan. The CAPD provisionally entered into force from December. Meanwhile, in June the EU appointed a Special Envoy to Afghanistan. A new EU Strategy for Afghanistan was approved in October, and in August 2018 the EU approved a roadmap for engagement with civil society in Afghanistan during 2018-20. At an international conference on Afghanistan, held in Geneva, Switzerland, in November 2020, the EU announced long-term and emergency assistance totalling some €1,200m. during 2021-25. In June 2021 the EP expressed concerns about the security situation in Afghanistan, following the decision to withdraw all US and North Atlantic Treaty Organization troops from the country by 11 September. After the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in mid-August, the EU suspended development aid to Afghanistan (but not humanitarian aid, to which it allocated a package of €142.8m. in November 2023, in addition to €80m. announced in October) and announced its intention to maintain `operational engagement’ with the regime (which did not, however, imply official recognition of the new Government).

                         <p usage="edio">A number of specific agreements were concluded between the EC and the USA: a co-operation agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy entered into force in 1959, and agreements on environmental matters and on fisheries came into force in 1974 and 1984, respectively. Additional agreements provide for co-operation in other fields of scientific research and development, while bilateral contacts take place in many areas not covered by a formal agreement. A Transatlantic Declaration on EC-US relations was concluded in November 1990: the two parties agreed to consult each other on important matters of common interest, and to increase formal contacts. A new Transatlantic Agenda for EU-US relations was signed by the US President and the Presidents of the Commission and the European Council at a meeting in Madrid, Spain, in December 1995. In June 1997 the EU and the USA agreed to introduce a mutual recognition agreement, to enable goods (including pharma­ceutical products, telecommunications equipment and electrical apparatus) undergoing tests in Europe to be marketed in the USA or Canada without the need for further testing. In May 1998, at an EU-US summit held in London, United Kingdom, a new Transatlantic Economic Partnership (TEP) was launched, to remove tech­nical trade barriers, eliminate industrial tariffs, establish a free trade area in services, and further liberalize measures relating to government procurement, intellectual property and investment. (The agricultural and audiovisual sectors were excluded from the TEP.) At an EU-US summit held in April 2007, in Washington, DC, USA, a Framework for Advancing Transatlantic Economic Integration between the USA and the EU was adopted. In February 2012 the EU and the USA announced plans to launch negotiations, with the aim of concluding a new, bilateral trade agreement. Negotiations on the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) with the USA commenced in mid-2013. However, the TTIP attracted controversy, with concerns primarily focusing on the protection of regulatory and environmental standards, public services and investors’ rights, and it appeared moribund by the end of US President Barack Obama’s term of office in early 2017. On 2 December 2020, following the election of Joe Biden as US President, the European Commission proposed a new transatlantic agenda for global co-operation in a number of areas, including environmental protection and efforts to combat the threat posed by COVID-19 (following a policy of increased US protectionism and a focus on domestic priorities under President Donald Trump from 2017).</p>

                         <p usage="ewyb">Following the election of Donald Trump as US President in November 2016, President of the European Council Donald Tusk confirmed that the EU would continue to pursue a co-operative relationship with the USA and seek to maintain transatlantic unity. In 2018 tensions in trade relations between the EU and the USA intensified, after the USA imposed tariffs of 25% and 10%, respectively, on imports of steel and aluminium from the EU, apparently owing to national security concerns, prompting the EU to impose retaliatory tariffs. Following a meeting held in Washington, DC, in July 2018 between US President Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, a joint statement was published, with an agreement to launch new trade negotiations; however, talks did not proceed, in part owing to the insistence by the USA that agricultural products be included in any agreement; meanwhile, the World Trade Organization approved the imposition by the USA of additional tariffs on EU goods in that year. In December 2020, following the election of Joe Biden as US President, the European Commission proposed a new transatlantic agenda for global co-operation in a number of areas, including environmental protection and efforts to combat the threat posed by COVID-19. In September 2021 a new, ministerial-level, joint EU-US Trade and Technology Council (TTC) met in Pittsburgh, PA, USA, for the first time, with the aim of helping to co-ordinate approaches towards global technologies, to deepen economic and trade relations, and to promote democratic values.</p>

          Meanwhile, following revelations, in 2013, of large-scale intelligence-gathering programmes by the USA, in November the Commission presented a six-point action plan detailing measures required in order to restore trust in data flows between the EU and the USA, including the rapid adoption of revised data protection legislation; proposals to strengthen the bilateral, voluntary EU-US `safe harbour’ agreement of 2000, under which US companies pledged to protect the data privacy of EU customers; strengthening data protection safeguards; a commitment to the use of the existing EU-US Mutual Legal Assistance agreement
          
           and existing sectoral agreements to secure access to data from the EU; addressing European concerns as part of the ongoing review of surveillance procedures taking place within the USA; and the international promotion of standards pertaining to privacy. In September 2015 a new EU-US data protection agreement was initialled, establishing a comprehensive framework for co-operation between the EU and the USA on matters relating to law enforcement, and covering personal information exchanged between the EU and USA in relation to criminal offences (including terrorism). In February 2016 the Commission and the USA announced that political agreement had been reached on an arrangement effectively superseding the safe harbour agreement, which had been declared invalid by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in October 2015. The new EU-US Privacy Shield was adopted by the Commission in July 2016, but in July 2020 it too was declared invalid by the ECJ.

                    <heading>Generalized System of Preferences</heading>
                    <p id="WB02048.IO.TXT.266">In July 1971 the EC introduced a generalized system of preferences (GSP) for tariffs in favour of developing countries, ensuring duty free entry to the EC of all manufactured and semi-manufactured industrial products, including textiles, but subject in certain circumstances to preferential limits. Preferences, usually in the form of a tariff reduction, were also offered on some agricultural products. In 1980 the Council adopted an operational framework for industrial products, based on the degree of competitiveness of the developing country concerned. From 1977 the EC progres­sively liberalized GSP access for the least developed countries (LDCs) by according them duty-free entry on all products and by exempting them from virtually all preferential limits.</p>
                    <p id="WB02048.IO.TXT.267">In December 1994 the European Council adopted a revised GSP for 1995-98, which provided additional trade benefits to encourage environmentally sound policies and internationally recognized labour standards. Conversely, a country’s preferential entitlement could be withdrawn, for example, if it permitted forced labour. Duties were eliminated in their entirety (with the exception of arms and ammunition) for 49 LDCs. Duties were also suspended for five Latin American countries, conditional on the implementation of campaigns against the production and trade of illegal drugs. In 2001 a trade scheme in support of LDCs, Everything but Arms (EBA), was introduced, which granted those countries duty- and quota-free access to EU markets. By the time the GSP for 2006-08 was agreed, the total number of products covered had expanded to some 7,200. Additional preferences were granted under the GSP+ incentive scheme to particularly vulnerable countries pursuing good governance and sustainable development policies. Countries eligible for GSP+ must ratify and implement 27 international conventions and agree to co-operate with the European Commission in monitoring their implementation; the Commission publishes a report every two years on their progress.</p>
                    <p>
          A revised GSP entered into effect on 1 January 2014, which aimed to strengthen GSP+ and increase the effectiveness of trade concessions for the LDCs through the EBA scheme, increase transparency, and was to be renewable every 10 years (with the exception of EBA, which did not require renewal). Developing countries are eligible for the GSP if they have an income level below `upper middle income’, as classified by the World Bank, and provided that they are not beneficiaries of another arrangement (such as a free trade agreement) that gives them preferential access to EU markets. However, LDCs receive the benefits of the EBA scheme even if they do have another arrangement in place. All countries benefiting from the GSP must observe the principles of 15 specific conventions relating to human and labour rights. In February 2020 the European Commission withdrew some of the tariff preferences granted to Cambodia under the EBA trade scheme owing to human rights violations. A Council mandate was agreed in December 2022 on the revision of the GSP; negotiations between the Council presidency and the European Parliament (EP) were to take place, with the new rules intended to come into force in January 2024 on the expiry of the existing GSP. In July 2023 the Commission put forward proposals to extend the GSP from 2024-27
          
          , in the absence of an agreement on a revised system; an amendment to the existing GSP was duly signed by the Council and the EP in November.

The European Commission’s Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (DG ECHO), established in 1991 as the Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection Office, co-ordinates the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance and food aid. ECHO, based in Brussels, which became fully operational in 1993, finances operations conducted by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and international agencies, with which it works in partnership. In 2007 the Commission adopted a European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid, which established an EU policy framework for responding to humanitarian crises. Relations between ECHO and its partners are governed by Framework Partnership Agreements (FPAs), which define roles and responsibilities in the implementation of humanitarian operations financed by the EU. ECHO aims to meet the immediate needs of victims of natural and man-made disasters worldwide, in such areas as assisting displaced persons, health and mine-clearing programmes.</p>
