          <p id="WB02047.IO.TXT.5000" usage="ewyb edio casee">The European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) was created by a treaty signed in Paris, France, on 18 April 1951 (effective from 25 July 1952) to pool the coal and steel production of the six original members. It was regarded as a first step towards a united Europe. The European Economic Community (EEC) was established by the Treaty of Rome, signed in Rome, Italy, on 25 March 1957 (effective from 1 January 1958), to create a common market. The European Atomic Energy Community (Eur&#173;atom) was established alongside by a separate treaty to promote growth in nuclear industries. The common institutions of the three Communities were established by a treaty signed in Brussels, Belgium, on 8 April 1965 (effective from 1 July 1967).</p>
          <p id="WB02047.IO.TXT.5001" usage="ewyb edio casee">The EEC was formally changed to the European Community (EC) under the Maastricht Treaty, or Treaty on European Union (effective from 1 November 1993), although in practice the term EC had been used for several years to describe the three Communities together. The treaty established a Euro&#173;pean Union (EU), which introduced citizenship thereof and aimed to increase intergovernmental co-operation in economic and monetary affairs; to establish a common foreign and security policy; and to introduce co-operation in justice and home affairs. The EU was placed under the supervision of the European Council (comprising heads of state or of government of member countries), while the EC continued to exist, having competence in matters relating to the Treaty of Rome and its amendments.</p>
          <p id="WB02047.TXT.5002" usage="ewyb edio casee">The Treaty of Paris establishing the ECSC expired on 23 July 2002, resulting in the termination of the ECSC legal regime and procedures and the dissolution of the ECSC Consultative Committee. The ECSC&#8217;s assets and liabilities were transferred to the overall EU budget, while rights and obligations arising from international agreements drawn up between the ECSC and third countries were devolved to the EC.</p>
          <p>In December 2001 the European Council adopted the Declaration on the Future of the European Union, which aimed to reform EU institutions to ensure the smooth functioning of the Union after enlargement. The full text of the draft constitutional treaty was submitted to the Council of the European Union (often known as the Council) in July 2003. At a summit meeting held in Brussels in June 2004, the heads of state and of government of the then 25 EU member states approved the draft constitutional treaty, which was formally signed in Rome in October by the heads of state or of government of the 25 member states and the three candidate countries of Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey (officially redesignated as T&#252;rkiye in June 2022). However, the treaty remained subject to ratification by each member nation (either by a vote in the national legislature or by a popular referendum), and in May and June 2005 it was rejected in national referendums held in France and the Netherlands, respectively.</p>
          <p>At an informal summit of the European Council held in Lisbon, Portugal, in mid-October 2007, agreement was reached at an Intergovernmental Conference on the final text of a new reform treaty. The resulting Treaty of Lisbon amending the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community was signed in Lisbon, on 13 December, by the heads of state or of government of the now 27 member states. The Treaty of Lisbon retained much of the content of the abandoned constitutional treaty. In June 2008 voters in Ireland, which was constitutionally bound to conduct a popular referendum on the issue, rejected ratification of the treaty. Consequently, in December the European Council agreed to a number of concessions, including the removal of a provision in the treaty for a reduction in the number of European Commissioners. A new referendum, held in Ireland in October 2009, approved the treaty. By early November all EU member states had ratified the Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force on 1 December. The Treaty of Rome was duly renamed the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, with references to the European `Community&#8217; changed to the `Union&#8217;. Euratom continued to exist, alongside the EU.</p>
          <p>Meetings of the principal organs take place in Brussels, in Luxembourg and in Strasbourg, France. The Treaty of Lisbon created a High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (appointed by the European Council by qualified majority with the agreement of the President of the Commission) to represent the EU internationally, combining the former roles of EU Commissioner responsible for external relations and EU High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy (although foreign policy remains subject to a national veto). The Lisbon Treaty also provided for the creation of a new permanent President of the European Council, elected by the European Council; the creation of this role aimed to promote coherence and continuity in policymaking. The system of a six-month rotating Presidency was retained for the different formations of the Council of the European Union (except for the External Relations Council, chaired by the High Representative). A new system of fixed 18-month troikas (groups of three presidencies) was introduced, sharing the presidencies of most configurations of the Council, to facilitate overall co-ordination and continuity of work. The Lisbon Treaty provided for a revised system of qualified majority voting in the Council. The European Parliament&#8217;s (EP) legislative powers were consolidated under the Lisbon Treaty, which granted the Parliament the right of co-decision with the Council in an increased number of policy areas, giving it a more prominent role in framing legislation. The maximum number of seats in the EP was raised to 751 from 2014.</p>
          <p>The Lisbon Treaty sought to improve democracy and transparency within the Union, introducing the right for EU citizens to petition the Commission to introduce new legislation and enshrining the principles of subsidiarity (that the EU should only act when an objective can be better achieved at supranational level, implying that national powers are the norm) and proportionality (that the action should be proportional to the desired objective). National parliaments are given the opportunity to examine EU legislation to ensure that it rests within the EU&#8217;s remit, and legislation may be returned to the Commission for reconsideration if one-third of member states find that a proposed law breaches these principles. The Treaty of Lisbon enabled enhanced co-operation for groups numbering at least one-third of the member states. The treaty provided a legal basis for an EU defence force, with a mutual defence clause, and stipulated that the EU has the power to sign treaties and sit on international bodies as a legal entity in its own right. It also provided for the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office to combat EU fraud and cross-border crime and the right to dual citizenship (i.e. of the EU as well as of a member state). Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon provides for a member state to withdraw from the Union if it so wishes, `in accordance with its own constitutional requirements&#8217;. Such a member state must notify the European Council of its intention, thereby formally invoking Article 50. If a withdrawing member state later wishes to apply to rejoin the EU, its application will be considered as that of a third country (under Article 49 of the Treaty of Lisbon).</p>

               <p usage="ewyb edio casee">The six original members (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands) were joined in the European Communities (later the EU) on 1 January 1973 by Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom, and on 1 January 1981 by Greece. In a referendum held in February 1982, the inhabitants of Greenland voted to end their membership of the Community, entered into when under full Danish rule. Greenland&#8217;s withdrawal took effect from 1 February 1985. Portugal and Spain became members on 1 January 1986. Following the reunification of Germany in October 1990, the former German Democratic Republic immediately became part of the Community (subject to a transitional period before certain Community legislation took effect there). Austria, Finland and Sweden became members on 1 January 1995.</p>
               <p usage="ewyb edio casee">At the Copenhagen (Denmark) summit on 13 December 2002 the European Council agreed that 10 candidate countries, comprising eight in Central and Eastern Europe (the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia), and Malta and Cyprus, should join the EU on 1 May 2004. The leaders of the 10 new member states signed an accession treaty in Athens, Greece, on 16 April 2003. The Treaty of Athens had to be ratified by all 25 states prior to accession. The 15 existing member states opted to ratify the treaty in parliament whereas the future member states, except Cyprus (the Cypriot Parliament unanimously approved accession to the EU on 14 July 2003), adopted the treaty by referendum. Only the Greek Cypriot sector of Cyprus was admitted to the EU on 1 May, in the absence of a settlement on the divided status of the island.</p>
               <p usage="ewyb edio casee">Romania submitted its application for EU membership in June 1995, and Bulgaria in December. Accession negotiations started with both countries in February 2000. In October 2004 the Commission proposed a new clause in accession treaties under which membership negotiations could be suspended if candidate countries failed to fulfil the economic and political criteria established in Copenhagen in December 2002, according to which a prospective member must be a stable democracy, respecting human rights, the rule of law and the protection of minorities; have a functioning market economy; and adopt the common rules, standards and policies that make up the body of EU law. Bulgaria and Romania provisionally completed formal negotiations in June and December 2004, respectively, and this was confirmed at the Brussels European Council meeting of 17 December. The Commission approved the accession applications of Romania and Bulgaria on 22 February 2005, and the two countries signed a joint accession treaty on 25 April. They formally became members of the Union on 1 January 2007.</p>
               <p usage="ewyb edio casee">Croatia submitted its application for membership of the EU in February 2003; membership negotiations commenced in October 2005 and were completed in June 2011, and Croatia signed an accession treaty on 9 December. Croatia acceded to full membership of the EU on 1 July 2013, following approval of membership by a referendum held in that country in January 2012.</p>
               <p usage="ewyb edio casee mena">Turkey (officially redesignated as T&#252;rkiye in June 2022), which had signed an association agreement with the EC in 1963 (which was suspended between 1980 and 1986, following a military coup), applied for membership of the EU in April 1987. In 1999 the European Council granted Turkey candidate status. In April 2004 a United Nations (UN) plan for the reunification of Cyprus was rejected in a referendum by the Greek Cypriots in the south of the island. Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey invaded the northern third of the country in response to a Greek-sponsored coup aiming to unite the island with Greece. T&#252;rkiye refuses to recognize the Greek Cypriot Government and is the only country to recognize the Government of the northern section of the country, known as the `Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus&#8217;. The requirement for the successful resolution of all territorial disputes with members of the EU meant that failure to reach a settlement in Cyprus remained an impediment to Turkey&#8217;s accession. The EU agreed to begin accession talks with Turkey in October 2005, although it warned that membership was not guaranteed. Turkey had to sign a protocol to update its association agreement with the EU prior to accession negotiations, to cover the 10 new members that had joined the organization in May 2004, including Cyprus. Turkey, which signed the protocol in July 2005, insisted that the extension of the association agreement did not constitute formal recognition of the Greek Cypriot Government. In November 2006 the Commission demanded that Turkey open its ports to Cypriot ships, in compliance with its agreement to extend its customs union to the 10 new member states in 2005. Turkey announced that there could be no progress on this issue until the EU implemented a regulation drafted in 2004 to end the economic isolation of the `Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus&#8217;, which had been blocked by Cyprus. In December 2006, therefore, the Council stipulated that talks would not commence in eight policy areas affected by the restrictions placed on Cypriot traffic by Turkey. After a period of impasse, negotiations opened in additional policy areas in December 2015 and June 2016, amid increased co-operation between the EU and Turkey on migration. However, in November 2016 the European Parliament approved a non-binding resolution supporting the temporary suspension of accession negotiations with Turkey, owing to concerns over human rights and the rule of law following the suppression of an attempted coup in July. In March 2019 Parliament supported a non-binding resolution formally suspending negotiations with Turkey, owing to continued concerns about human rights and the introduction there of a new Constitution strengthening the powers of President Recep Tayyip Erdo&#287;an. Negotiations have been at a standstill since 2018; in its annual review of the enlargement process adopted in December 2023, the Council expressed its concerns about `backsliding in the areas of democracy, rule of law and fundamental rights&#8217; in T&#252;rkiye, as well as the country&#8217;s stance on the Israel&#8211;Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) conflict in the Gaza Strip.</p>
               <p usage="ewyb edio casee">The former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia (FYRM&#8212;now North Macedonia) was granted candidate status in December 2005. In June 2008 the Council determined that, as a precondition of the FYRM&#8217;s accession, an ongoing dispute with Greece concerning its name (Macedonia also being the name of a region of Greece) must be satisfactorily resolved. The Prespa Agreement with Greece entered into effect in February 2019, resolving the longstanding name dispute, and the FYRM was officially renamed as the Republic of North Macedonia. As part of the agreement, Greece formally removed its objection to North Macedonia&#8217;s accession to the EU. Meanwhile, Albania had submitted a membership application in April 2009. In June 2014 the Council agreed to grant candidate status to Albania. In May 2019 the Commission recommended that membership talks should commence with both Albania and North Macedonia. In March 2020 EU ministers finally reached political agreement on opening accession negotiations with Albania and North Macedonia, a decision that was endorsed by the European Council. Accession negotiations commenced in July 2022.</p>
               <p usage="ewyb edio casee">Montenegro applied for EU membership in December 2008, and the European Council confirmed Montenegro&#8217;s status as a candidate country in December 2010. In October 2011 the European Commission declared that Montenegro had fulfilled the political and economic criteria needed to begin EU membership negotiations, and these commenced in June 2012. Serbia applied for EU membership in December 2009 and was granted candidate country status by the European Council on 1 March 2012. Although accession negoti&#173;ations commenced in January 2014, talks on the first two policy areas began only in December 2015. In December 2023, in its annual review of progress towards EU membership, the Council stated that Serbia must normalize relations with Kosovo; make further progress in the areas of the rule of law and fundamental rights, including the independence of the judiciary and freedom and independence of the media; and commit to aligning with the EU&#8217;s stance on the conflict in Ukraine, following the Russian Federation&#8217;s invasion of that country.</p>
               <p>Bosnia and Herzegovina submitted a formal application for membership of the EU in February 2016; it was granted candidate status in December 2022. Ukraine applied for EU membership at the end of February, and Georgia and Moldova submitted membership applications in early March. In June the European Council awarded candidate status to both Moldova and Ukraine, and in December 2023 agreed to open accession negotiations with both countries. Georgia was granted candidate status in December 2023; in its annual progress review, the Council stressed that priorities for Georgia were a commitment to the `proper functioning of democratic institutions&#8217; and reforms in the areas of justice and the rule of law. In March 2024 the Commission recommended the opening of accession negotiations with Bosnia and Herzegovina, a recommendation that was endorsed by the European Council in the same month. </p>

               <heading>The United Kingdom&#8217;s Decision to Leave the European Union</heading>
               <p>On 23 June 2016 51.9% of the participating electorate in the UK voted in favour of withdrawal from the EU (commonly referred to as Brexit). The British Government formally invoked Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon on 29 March 2017.</p>
               <p>Negotiations between the EU and the UK officially commenced on 19 June 2017, with the aim of concluding an agreement establishing arrangements for the country&#8217;s departure from the Union, while seeking to develop a framework for the UK&#8217;s future relations with the EU. The UK was originally expected to leave the EU in March 2019, two years after invoking Article 50. In January 2018 the Council adopted supplementary negotiating directives relating to a proposed period of transition (or so-called implementation period) until 31 December 2020. During this period, the UK would not be represented at the EU, but it would remain subject to EU law.</p>
               <p>On 14 November 2018 a draft withdrawal agreement was published. On 25 November the withdrawal agreement and the associated political declaration on the future relationship between the UK and the EU were approved at a special meeting of the European Council. The aim of the withdrawal agreement was to establish terms for the UK&#8217;s orderly exit from the EU, including provisions for the implementation period. The political declaration provided guidelines for the negotiation of the future relationship between the two parties by the end of 2020, with provision for an economic partnership, a security partnership and agreement on other areas deemed to be of shared interest. However, on 10 December 2018 a parliamentary vote on the withdrawal agreement in the UK was delayed, owing to widespread opposition to it by both Eurosceptic parliamentarians and those who had supported remaining in the EU (particular controversy surrounded efforts to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland). Amid an ongoing impasse in the UK Parliament, and the resignation of Prime Minister Theresa May, the European Council agreed to allow the UK to extend Article 50 and delay Brexit, first until 22 May, later until 31 October, and finally until 31 January 2020.</p>
               <p>
        Prime Minister Boris Johnson&#8217;s Conservative Party secured a large majority at a general election held in December 2019, effectively removing obstacles to the parliamentary approval of a revised withdrawal agreement (which had been agreed on 17 October). Its signature by both sides took place on 24 January 2020 and the UK officially left the EU at the end of January. The withdrawal agreement consequently entered into force and an 11-month transition period commenced, during which the UK was required to adhere to EU legislation and to contribute to the EU&#8217;s budget. During the period of transition new EU-UK negotiations took place, in order to determine various issues of joint interest, notably trade arrangements. On 24 December both sides finally concluded a wide-ranging trade and co-operation agreement, which was provisionally applied from 1 January 2021, and which officially entered into force on 1 May.
