          <p>FAO’s Strategic Framework for 2022-31, endorsed by the Conference in June 2021, aimed to support the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by guiding a global transformation to more resilient, inclusive, efficient and sustainable agrifood systems, characterized by four guiding aspirations: Better Production, Better Nutrition, Better Environment, and Better Life, with a strong focus on leaving no one behind. The Framework placed a particular focus on the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere; SDG 2: End hunger, to achieve food security and improved nutrition, and to promote sustainable agriculture; and SDG 10: Reduce inequalities in and among countries. It included four cross-cutting `accelerators’—innovation, technology, data, and `complements’ (i.e. human capital, governance and institutions)—to be prioritized in all of its programme interventions. The Framework had 20 inter-disciplinary programme priority areas (PPAs), grouped under each of the four aspirations. The PPAs for Better Production were: green innovation, blue (i.e. marine) transformation, one health, small-scale producers’ equitable access to resources, and digital agriculture; for Better Nutrition: healthy diets for all, nutrition for the most vulnerable, safe food for everyone, reducing food loss and waste, and transparent markets and trade; for Better Environment: climate change mitigating and adapted agrifood systems, bioeconomy for sustainable food and agriculture, and biodiversity and ecosystem services for food and agriculture; and for Better Life: gender equality and rural women’s empowerment, inclusive rural transformation, achieving sustainable urban food systems, agriculture and food emergencies, resilient agrifood systems, FAO’s Hand-in-Hand initiative (q.v.), and scaling up investment. A Medium-Term Plan aligned with the 2022-31 Strategic Framework, was being implemented during 2022-25.</p>
          <p>FAO aims to serve as a knowledge network in support of development, as well as to provide a neutral forum to enhance public-private collaboration and to bring knowledge directly to the field. In February 2020 FAO was a founding signatory of the Rome Call for Artificial Intelligence Ethics, which outlined fundamental principles to ensure that technological advances serve all of humanity and contribute to protection of the global environment. FAO has aimed to lead efforts to transform food systems on the basis of a digital, data and scientific approach. In December 2020 the FAO Council approved a new Strategy for Private Sector Engagement.</p>
          <p>
      The FAO Director-General assists the UN Secretary-General’s chairmanship of a High-Level Task Force (HLTF) on Global Food and Nutrition Security that was established in 2008 and has 22 member (mainly UN) agencies. FAO hosts at its headquarters the intergovernmental Committee on World Food Security (CFS: established in 1974 and reformed in 2009), which is tasked with influencing hunger elimination programmes at global, regional and national level, taking into account that food security relates not just to agriculture but also to economic access to food, adequate nutrition, social safety nets and human rights. FAO, the 
      <xr pageref="N" ref="SL607803">World Food Programme</xr>
       (WFP) and the 
      <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-UN.2049">International Fund for Agricultural Development</xr>
       (IFAD) support the policy work of the CFS, in addition to science-based reports produced regularly by a UN High Level Panel of Experts (HLPE) on Food Security and Nutrition (established in 2009).
    </p>
          <p>In March 2022, in an address to an extraordinary meeting of the ministers responsible for agriculture of the Group of Seven (G7) advanced economies, the FAO Director-General stated great concern at the outlook for food prices (already at a record high) in the context of the Russian Federation’s military invasion of Ukraine—given that Russia and Ukraine had accounted for around 30% of wheat exports and 55% of exports of sunflower oil to global markets in 2021, and were also major exporters of barley, maize and rapeseed oil; in addition, Russia was a significant exporter of fertilizers. FAO was invited to engage with a G7-World Bank Global Alliance for Food Security that was launched in May at a meeting of G7 ministers responsible for development. In July negotiations held in İstanbul, Türkiye, under the auspices of the UN and Türkiye, culminated in the conclusion by Russia and Ukraine of the UN-backed Black Sea Grain Initiative (BSGI), aimed at alleviating global food insecurity by enabling the resumption of exports of grain, sunflower oil and other essential goods from Odesa and two other Ukrainian Black Sea ports (that had hitherto been blockaded by Russia), and at facilitating fertilizer and grain exports from Russia (which had been subjected to punitive sanctions). Extensions to the BSGI were subsequently agreed; however, on 17 July 2023 the initiative lapsed, the Russian authorities having refused to renew it, claiming that commitments made to Russia had not been fulfilled.</p>
          <p>In February 2023 FAO’s Director-General and the heads of the World Bank Group, WFP, International Monetary Fund and World Trade Organization (WTO) issued a joint statement in which they called for further urgent collective actions (i) to rescue hunger hotspots: through supporting country-level efforts to strengthen crisis preparedness, share information, and address local needs; (ii) to facilitate trade (including supporting measures aimed at increasing the availability of food and fertilizers and strengthening the provision of public goods), to improve the functioning of markets, and to strengthen the role of the private sector; and (iii) to reform harmful subsidies and repurpose them towards initiatives promoting global food security and sustainable food systems.</p>

               <heading>Food Systems Summit (FSS)</heading>
               <p>
        In September 2021, at the start of the 76th UN General Assembly, FAO, WFP, IFAD and the UN Secretary-General collectively hosted the FSS (from New York, USA, in a virtual format), with a view to raising global awareness of challenges related to the production, processing, distribution and consumption of food, and to improving the output of safe, nutritious food. The FSS focused on the following five `Action Tracks’: (1) Ensure access to safe and nutritious food for all (1.1: Promote food security and reduce hunger; 1.2: Improve access to nutritious foods; and 1.3: Make food safer); (2) Shift to sustainable consumption patterns (2.1: Enable, inspire and motivate people to enjoy healthy and sustainable options; and 2.2: Slash food loss and waste and transition to a circular economy); (3) Boost nature-positive production (3.1: Protect natural ecosystems from new deforestation and from being converted into sources of food and feed production; 3.2: Manage, sustainably, existing food production systems; and 3.3: Restore degraded ecosystems and rehabilitate soil function for sustainable food production); (4) Advance equitable livelihoods (4.1: Rebalance agency within food systems—including a greater focus on the rights of and participation by often excluded groups; 4.2: Eliminate worker exploitation and ensure decent work in food systems; and 4.3: Localize food systems—including prioritizing short food chains and local markets); and (5) Build resilience to vulnerabilities, shocks and stress (5.1: Build food systems resilience; 5.2: Ensure universal food access to build resilience—i.e. reframe food as a public common good and human right, rather than as a commodity; and 5.3: Develop climate-resilient development pathways for the transformation of food systems and achievement of the UN SDGs). Governance—i.e. both FSS governance and broader food systems governance—was identified as a cross-cutting action area. A co-ordination hub, jointly led by FAO, WFP and IFAD, was established in January 2022 to support the follow-up to the summit, by collaborating with the intergovernmental CFS and the UN High Level Panel of Experts on Food Security and Nutrition (q.v.), and by strengthening synergies with the 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-UN.ECOSOC.12">UN High-Level Political Forum (HLPF) on Sustainable Development</xr>
        , financing for development, and other intergovernmental processes relating to the environment, biodiversity, climate, food security, health and nutrition. The hub was to be assisted by a Champions Advisory Group comprising strong stakeholder representation by, 
        <i>inter alia,</i>
         producers, the private sector, Indigenous peoples, youth and women. Until 2030 the UN Secretary-General was to submit an annual report to the HLPF on progress in following up the FSS, and was to convene a biennial global post-FSS stocktaking meeting.
      </p>
               <p>In May 2022 FAO helped to launch, as a core group member, a Coalition of Action for Healthy Diets from Sustainable Food Systems. From November FAO and IFAD assumed joint leadership of the Global Environment Facility’s new Food Systems Integrated Program: this aimed to channel some US&#8201;$230m. (to be amplified by co-financing) in grants towards country projects focused on sustainably transforming agrifood systems. In March 2023 FAO and the UN Industrial Development Organization launched the Agrifood Systems Transformation Accelerator, which aimed to foster partnerships and boost private-sector investment in LDCs’ food systems.</p>
               <p>
        The inaugural post-FSS global food systems meeting, the UN FSS+2 Stocktaking Moment, was convened in July 2023, in Rome, attended by senior representatives of 182 countries, as well as of UN entities and other stakeholder organizations. The meeting served to strengthen collaboration in support of new sustainable food system strategies; it concluded with the launch of the UN Secretary-General’s

         and the 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-ORG.ANIMAL.1">World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH)</xr>
        . In April 2022 the four organizations concluded a Memorandum of Understanding that provided for the establishment of a Quadripartite Collaboration for One Health, which was collectively to address challenges at the human-animal-plant-ecosystem interface. In October the Quadripartite launched a One Health Joint Plan of Action (OH-JPA), which was aimed at collectively integrating systems and capacities to enhance the prevention, detection and response to threats posed to the health of humans, animals, plants and the environment, while also contributing to sustainable development. In March 2023 the Quadripartite heads jointly issued a call to global action, urging that the concept of One Health should be prioritized in the international political agenda; that One Health policies, strategies and plans should be strengthened and accelerated; that intersectoral One Health-focused workforces should be established; that the prevention of pandemics and health threats should be addressed at source, with specific focus on activities and locations that present a significant risk of zoonotic spillover from animals to humans; that One Health-related scientific knowledge sharing should be strengthened; and that investment in One Health strategies and plans should be increased. In November 2022 FAO joined WHO and other agencies in a new Initiative on Climate Action and Nutrition (I-CAN).

               <p>FAO promotes equitable access to land and water resources and supports integrated land and water management, including river basin management and improved irrigation systems. In May 2012 the CFS endorsed a set of landmark Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security, with the aim of supporting governments in safeguarding the rights of citizens to own or have access to natural resources.</p>
               <p>FAO’s Agro-Ecological Zoning (AEZ) methodology, developed jointly with the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, is used for land resources assessment, identifying homogenous and contiguous areas possessing similar soil, land and climate characteristics. FAO’s database of Global Agro-Ecological Zones (GAEZ) is updated periodically. FAO has developed AQUASTAT as a global information system concerned with global water issues, and comprising databases, country and regional profiles, surveys and maps. AquaCrop, CropWat and ClimWat are further productivity models and databases that have been developed to help to assess crop requirements and potential yields.</p>
               <p>FAO promotes the equitable access of small-scale producers and family farmers to economic and natural resources, markets, services, education, information and technologies. Accessible digital technologies are also promoted, in agrifood systems, to enhance resilience, productivity and market opportunities. A Digital Village Initiative (FAO DVI) was being piloted in 2024 to advance the digitalization of rural areas.</p>
               <p>Through its Progressive Management Pathway for Antimicrobial Resistance (FAO-PMP-AMR) FAO supports countries to develop national action plans to guide the prudent use of antimicrobials in agriculture and food production and the prevention and control of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in food systems. In June 2019 FAO, WOAH and WHO collectively established an AMR Multi Partner Trust Fund, with initial funding of US&#8201;$5m. FAO, WOAH and WHO maintain an online Global Database for Antimicrobial Resistance Country Self Assessment. In November 2023 FAO hosted the inaugural plenary assembly of an AMR Multistakeholder Partnership Platform, which had been established by the Quadripartite in the previous year.</p>
               <p>FAO works with regional and international associations to develop seed networks, to encourage the use of improved seed production systems, to elaborate quality control and certification mechanisms and to co-ordinate seed security activities, in particular in areas prone to natural or man-made disasters. In November 2011 the FAO Council adopted the Second Global Plan of Action for Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (updating the first, 1996 Global Plan). The International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, which was adopted by the FAO Conference in 2001 and entered into force in June 2004, provides a framework to ensure access to plant genetic resources and to related knowledge and technologies. The Treaty's Benefit-sharing Fund (BSF) provides finance to enable small-scale farmers in developing countries to conserve principal food crops and build resilience to impacts of climate change. By 2024 around 1,750 gene banks had been established worldwide, storing more than 7m. plant samples, covering both food crops and related wild variants.</p>

FAO also undertakes national capacity-building activities and training on locust control, carries out field assessment missions, co-ordinates locust control operations, and extends emergency assistance during upsurges in locust populations (i.e. when uncontrolled breeding occurs for successive seasons, leading to the formation of `hopper bands’ of flightless juveniles and to adult swarms; in the most extreme scenario widespread intense infestations are referred to as a `plague’). Three specialized FAO locust commissions cover arid and semi-arid areas of Africa and Asia where desert locusts are particularly prevalent. Control methods include aerial, vehicle-mounted or manual spraying of affected areas with conventional chemical pesticides (of which 10 have been approved by an advisory body of experts: the Pesticide Referee Group); biopesticides (promoted by FAO); or insect control regulators.</p>
               <p>The Joint FAO/International Atomic Energy Agency Division maintains a network of agriculture and biotechnology laboratories.

               <p>FAO aims to facilitate and secure the long-term sustainable development of capture fisheries and aquaculture, in both inland and marine waters, and to promote their contribution to world food security. It plays a leading role in working towards attainment of SDG 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. In February 2021 FAO’s Committee on Fisheries acknowledged the role of sustainable managed aquatic food systems in combating poverty and malnutrition, leading to the incorporation of a Blue Transformation concept as a priority area in FAO’s new Strategic Framework. </p>

FAO extends technical support to improve the management and conservation of aquatic resources, trade of products, preservation, marketing and quality assurance. FAO works to ensure that small-scale fishing communities (accounting for around 90% of the sector’s work force) reap equitable benefits from the international trade in fish (including crustaceans and molluscs), fish products and fish by-products (such as fish heads, backbones and viscera). The agency led an initiative in 1999 to establish the Regional Fishery Body Secretariat Network (RSN) as a mechanism to facilitate the exchange of information, data and best practices among FAO and non-FAO regional fishery bodies or arrangements. FAO hosted the ninth meeting of the RSN in September 2022.

        The 2022 edition of 
        <publ-name>The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture</publ-name>
        , which focused on the Blue Transformation concept, highlighted the expanding role of the aquatic food sector. In 2020 fisheries and aquaculture production totalled 177.8m. metric tons (of which 157.4m. metric tons was for human consumption), compared with an average of 110.7m. metric tons (81.6m. metric tons for human consumption) in the 1990s. Exports of aquatic products in 2020 amounted to US $150.5m., compared with $46.6m. in the 1990s.
      </p>
               <p>In February 1999 the FAO Committee on Fisheries adopted voluntary international measures, within the framework of a 1995 Code of Conduct for Responsible Fishing (CCRF), in order to reduce over-exploitation of the world's fish resources. Voluntary guidelines concerning the so-called eco-labelling and certification of fish and fish products were adopted in March 2005. FAO’s FishCode programme supports developing countries in implementing the CCRF. Several international plans of action (IPOA) have been elab­or­ated within the context of the Code, including the IPOA to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing (IPOA-IUU, 2001). In June 2014 FAO endorsed a series of Voluntary Guidelines for Securing Sustainable Small-Scale Fisheries (SSF).</p>

In July 2018 the Committee on Fisheries endorsed a series of FAO Voluntary Guidelines for the Marking of Fishing Gear, with a view to reducing the level of discarded so-called `ghost gear’ that represents a significant proportion of marine plastic pollution, putting marine species at risk.</p>
               <p>More than 600 fish species are produced in aquaculture, with a particular focus on salmonids, carps, tilapias and shrimps. The establishment of a Global Aquaculture Advancement Partnership (GAAP), conceptualized by FAO, and comprising governments, UN agencies, non-governmental organizations and private sector interests, was approved by more than 50 states in October 2013; GAAP was tasked with pursuing sustainable solutions to meeting the growing global demand for fish products, over a 10-15-year time period. In December 2021 the FAO Council adopted a Global Action Plan on Aquatic Genetic Resources (AqGR), and, with a view to promoting the sustainable conservation of genetic diversity in aquaculture production, FAO has developed an AqGR Monitoring System.</p>

         report, jointly prepared by FAO, IFAD, WFP, UNICEF and WHO, food security is defined as adequate access to food in both quality and quantity. The principal indicator used for ascertaining progress towards the eradication of hunger is SDG 2, Indicator 2.1.1: `Prevalence of Undernourishment’ (PoU—i.e. the estimated proportion of people with habitual food consumption that is insufficient to provide sufficient dietary energy levels to maintain a normal active and healthy life). In 2017 estimates derived from FAO’s Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) that related to the prevalence of severe food insecurity were incorporated for the first time into the 
        <publ-name>State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World</publ-name>
        , to supplement the metrics on PoU. (The FIES—initiated by FAO during 2014—provides internationally comparable measurements of the difficulty of accessing food, using data gathered in response to direct interviews with households or individuals.) Severe food insecurity refers to the exhaustion of food supplies, and to resulting hunger and grave impacts on health, wellbeing and ability to function. In 2019 the 
        <publ-name>State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World</publ-name>
         included, for the first time, FIES estimates of the prevalence of moderate as well as severe food insecurity, to address progress made towards achieving SDG 2, Indicator 2.1.2, relating to the ability to access nutritious and sufficient food, beyond the more extreme focus of 2.1.1 on the elimination of hunger. Moderate food insecurity is defined as a lack of assured, consistent access to food, involving the need at certain times to reduce the quality and/or the quantity of food intake.

Changes in land and water use and management, overexploitation, overharvesting, pollution, climate change, deforestation, population growth and urbanization were reported to be key drivers of biodiversity loss. The report urged governments and other stakeholders to strengthen frameworks and incentives aimed at reversing the biodiversity crisis. In December 2021 FAO and the International Fertilizer Association concluded a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on future co-operation in promoting sustainable fertilizer use and healthy soils.

It was noted that, globally, forests provide habitat for 68% of terrestrial mammals, 75% of bird species, and 80% of species of amphibians. The 2022 edition of FAO’s biennial report 
        <publ-name>The State of the World’s Forests</publ-name>
         focused on the potential contribution of three interrelated forestry pathways to the broader goals of a green recovery and more efficient, resilient and sustainable agrifood systems. FAO aimed to support member states to implement the pathways: Halting deforestation and maintaining forests; Restoring degraded lands and expanding agroforesty; and Sustainably using forests and building green value chains.

               <p>In September 2008 FAO, with UNEP and the UN Development Programme, launched the UN Collaborative Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (UN-REDD), with the aim of enabling donors to pool resources (through a trust fund established for that purpose) to promote a transformation of forest resource use patterns.</p>
               <p>FAO is a member of the Collaborative Partnership on Forests, an informal voluntary arrangement among 14 agencies with significant forestry programmes, which was established in April 2004. FAO organizes a World Forestry Congress, generally held every six years. World Forestry Congress XV, co-organized by FAO and South Korea in that country’s capital, Seoul, in May 2022, adopted the Seoul Forest Declaration, which addressed the role of forests in combating global challenges including land degradation, biodiversity loss, climate change, hunger, and poverty.</p>

               <heading>Emergency Preparedness and Response</heading>
               <p>FAO's emergency operations are concerned with all aspects of disaster and risk prevention, mitigation, reduction and emergency relief and rehabilitation, with a particular emphasis on food security and rural populations. FAO works with governments to develop and implement disaster prevention policies and practices; it disseminates information from the various early warning systems and supports adaptation to climate variability and change, for example through the use of drought-resistant crops or the adoption of conservation agriculture techniques. Following an emergency, FAO works with governments and other development and humanitarian partners to assess the immediate and longer-term agriculture and food security needs of the affected population. It determines the appropriate response to a disaster situation through the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) scheme. Emergency co-ordination units may be established to manage the local response to an emergency and to facilitate and co-ordinate the delivery of inter-agency assistance. In order to rehabilitate agricultural production following a disaster FAO provides emergency seeds, tools, other materials and technical and training assistance. FAO aims to strengthen the capacity of local institutions to manage and mitigate risk and provides technical assistance to improve access to land for displaced populations in countries following conflict or a natural disaster. Under the UN’s Cluster Approach to co-ordinating the international response to humanitarian disasters, FAO and WFP jointly lead the Food Security Cluster, which aims to combine expertise in agricultural assistance and food aid to improve the resilience of food-insecure disaster-affected communities.</p>
               <p>FAO's Global Information and Early Warning System (GIEWS), which become operational in 1975, monitors and maintains a database on the crop and food outlook at global, regional, national and subnational level in order to detect emerging food supply difficulties and disasters, and to ensure rapid intervention in countries experiencing food supply shortages. It publishes regular updates, highlighting countries in crisis requiring external assistance for food; countries with unfavourable prospects for current crops; and domestic price warnings (for countries where abnormally high prices are being reported in main markets for basic food commodities). An appropriate international response is then recommended. FAO’s Agricultural Stress Index System (ASIS), initiated in 2015, uses earth observation technologies to identify agricultural areas at risk of `water stress’ (drought).</p>

               <p usage="ass">The food security situation in Somalia—a drought-prone low production, food-deficit country—has been exacerbated by the inaccessibility of extensive rebel-controlled areas, as well as high staple food prices and low purchasing power. A Somalia Water and Land Information Management (SWALIM) initiative is implemented there, and rapid food security assessments and household surveys are regularly conducted through FAO’s Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit for Somalia (FSNAU). In April 2023 the IPC warned that during the period March-June around 6.6m. people in Somalia were at risk of acute food insecurity, and that some 12,000 (displaced people in Baidoa and Mogadishu, and agropastoralists in Burhakaba) were in danger of starvation. Some 1.8m. children in Somalia were estimated to be acutely malnourished in 2023. Under the UN’s 2023 Global Humanitarian Appeal FAO requested US&#8201;$247.7m. to assist more than 2m. people in Somalia, through cash for work activities to rehabilitate community-owned assets; cash transfers; the supply of micro-gardening kits and of e-vouchers for the acquisition of nutritious food; the provision of agricultural inputs and of livelihood packages comprising seeds (including for sorghum, maize, cowpeas and mung beans), hoes and hermetic storage bags; the rehabilitation of water catchments; the delivery of supplementary feed, fodder and vitamin-rich range cubes, and de-worming and other veterinary services for livestock; and the provision of fish processing and cooking kits for smallholder traders, and of basic fishing gear and emergency kits to fisherfolk. Other requests by FAO under the 2023 Global Humanitarian Appeal included $106.4m. to assist 1.8m. people in the DRC, $87.5m. for Sudan (to support 3m. beneficiaries), $76.7m. for northeastern Nigeria (2m. beneficiaries), $74m. for Burkina Faso (1.5m. beneficiaries), $65m. for South Sudan (more than 6m. beneficiaries), $48m. for Mali (1.2m. beneficiaries), $45m. for the Central African Republic (1m. beneficiaries), $38.7m. for Mozambique (nearly 1m. beneficiaries), and $25.6m. for Niger (1.1m. beneficiaries).</p>
               <p usage="mena">In Syria FAO has worked to promote agricultural production and to safeguard livelihoods affected by the ongoing protracted civil war. Vegetable and poultry family farming have been supported, through the provision of basic inputs, and by ensuring basic water infrastructure and sustainable water management; livestock assets protected through the provision of feed and emergency animal health services, and through an initiative aimed at improving the reproductive performance of sheep and dairy cows; complementary income-generating activities, agroprocessing and cash-based transfers have been organized; and food security co-ordination prioritized, including through data collection and analysis, and the development of early warning systems. FAO requested US&#8201;$71m. under the UN’s Global Humanitarian Appeal for 2023 to support 2.7m. people in Yemen. FAO’s activities in that country have aimed to address the immediate food and nutrition security needs of extremely vulnerable households (for example, through the delivery of packages aimed at enabling crop, vegetable, poultry and dairy production); to provide emergency livelihoods support to IDPs; to assist fishing communities to increase productivity and market access (through the supply of fishing tools, net repair kits, cooler boxes, and the rehabilitation of fisheries infrastructure); to implement cash-for-work initiatives focused on rehabilitating community agricultural infrastructure; and to facilitate the delivery of fresh meat, milk and eggs to markets through support for the livestock sector (including restocking; vaccination services and veterinary treatments; and the distribution of fodder and feed packages). Under the Global Humanitarian Appeal for 2023 FAO also requested $40m. to assist 426,500 people in Lebanon, and $13.4m. to support 42,238 beneficiaries in Palestine.</p>

FAO participated in a multi-agency effort to provide emergency relief. In February 2024 FAO’s Deputy Director-General reported to the UN Security Council that almost all 2.2m. people living in Gaza were experiencing acute levels of food insecurity and that there was a high risk of famine. The conflict was reported to have decimated the territory’s agrifood system, with extensive damage to agricultural and fishing industry infrastructure, and extremely limited fuel and electricity for food production or to maintain water infrastructure and desalination plants.</p>
               <p usage="fea">FAO requested US&#8201;$21.6m. under the UN’s Global Humanitarian Appeal for 2023 to assist 533,480 beneficiaries in Myanmar, where, owing to violent conflict, political and economic insecurity, and intermittent climate-related shocks, in total 15.2m. people were reportedly vulnerable to moderate or severe food insecurity. Support was to include one-time cash transfers; cash-for-work initiatives focused on the rehabilitation of irrigation structures; the delivery of fertilizer; provision of animal feed; and supply of paddy rice seeds, as well as vegetable (specifically okra, spinach, bitter gourd, bok choy, and long bean) seeds. In mid-2021 the agency forecast an uncovered food gap of 860,000 metric tons for North Korea, which it had classified in that year as a country in need of external food assistance. Floods, typhoons and drought have damaged food production in North Korea, with fuel restrictions, old machinery and international sanctions presenting further challenges.</p>

Following the earthquake that devastated Sulawesi, Indonesia, in September 2018, FAO provided technical assistance to the nationally-led response, and supplied agricultural inputs and assets to enable affected farmers and fishers to restore food production.</p>
               <p usage="sasia">FAO appealed for US $59m. under the UN’s 2023 Global Humanitarian Appeal to assist 1.8m. people whose livelihoods had been devastated by severe flooding in mid-2022 in Pakistan. (FAO reported that some 1.7m. ha of agricultural land had been eliminated and 800,000 heads of livestock killed by the floods.) FAO’s support was to include multipurpose cash transfers; cash-for-work opportunities to rehabilitate irrigation channels and animal shelters; the provision of wheat, rice and maize seeds and of agricultural tools; the delivery of kitchen gardening kits (comprising seeds, fertilizers and tools); the supply of poultry and poultry feed and distribution of animal feed packages; and the provision of veterinary services (including de-worming treatments and livestock vaccinations). FAO aims to provide support for the agricultural sector in Afghanistan (devastated for many years by conflict and drought) in order to strengthen the country’s environmental rehabilitation and local food production. An Integrated Dairy Development Programme has been implemented to enhance employment and food security at a community level in Afghanistan. In May 2023 FAO warned that a large-scale Moroccan Locust infestation was erupting across eight provinces in northern and northeastern Afghanistan (the country’s wheat-growing area); the national locus control system was reported to have been significantly diminished in recent years.</p>
               <p usage="edio ass">From January 2020 FAO worked intensively to survey and combat the risk posed to crops and livestock by a proliferation of desert locust swarms in East Africa. Environmental impact assessments of damaged pastures and croplands were conducted in the worst affected countries (notably Ethiopia, Somalia and—experiencing locust infestation for the first time in 70 years—Kenya). During January-June FAO and partners significantly reduced the scope of the initial locust infestation, particularly in Kenya. Throughout the region they eradicated more than 400,000m. individual locusts and cleared 600,000 ha from locust swarms, preventing them from causing catastrophic damage to crops. Large-scale control operations also prevented a potential spread of the desert locust infestation to West Africa. A joint statement issued in late July by FAO, WFP and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development emphasized the triple risk to regional food security arising from the combined impact of the desert locust and COVID-19 crises, compounded by climatic shocks. FAO requested US&#8201;$230.5m., in a series of appeals, to support its locust surveillance and control operations and safeguard livelihoods during the period January 2020-December 2021. In March 2022 FAO concluded that the two-year upsurge of desert locusts in East Africa had ended, in part owing to low seasonal rainfall.</p>

In June 2021 the FAO Conference endorsed a budget totalling US&#8201;$1,005.6m. to fund its activities during 2022-23. Much of FAO's technical assistance programme and emergency relief and rehabilitation activities are funded from extrabudgetary sources, predominantly by trust funds that come mainly from donor countries and international financing institutions. Voluntary contributions of more than $1,600m. were mobilized in 2022.</p>
