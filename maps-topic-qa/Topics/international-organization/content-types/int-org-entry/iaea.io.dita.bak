          <heading>Activities</heading>
          <p>The Agency's activities focus on three `pillars’: technology (assisting research on, and practical application of, atomic energy for peaceful uses); safety; and verification (ensuring that special fissionable and other materials, services, equipment and information made available by the Agency or at its request or under its supervision are not used for any non-peaceful purpose). The Agency is committed to supporting member states in the use of nuclear science and technology to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and related targets, adopted by the international community in 2015. The IAEA’s medium-term strategy for 2024-29 included the following strategic objectives: Facilitating access to nuclear power and other nuclear technologies; Strengthening the promotion and development of nuclear science, technology and applications; Improving nuclear safety and security; Providing effective technical co-operation; Delivering effective and efficient Agency safeguards; and Providing effective, efficient and innovative management and sound programming and budget planning.</p>
          <p>In April 2022 the IAEA convened a First International Conference on Nuclear Law, to address emerging trends in nuclear legal frameworks. In December IAEA legal experts conducted the inaugural IAEA introductory course on nuclear law for university students, at Khalifa University in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).</p>

               <p>The IAEA reported that in January 2024 global operating nuclear power capacity totalled 370.2 GW. At that time the database of IAEA’s Power Reactor Information System (PRIS) listed 412 nuclear power reactors in operation worldwide (including 93 in the USA, 56 in France, 55 in the People’s Republic of China, 37 in the Russian Federation, 25 in the Republic of Korea—South Korea, 19 in India, and 19 in Canada); meanwhile, 58 reactors were under construction (of which 22 were in China and eight were in India). Some 21 reactors were in a state of suspended operation in Japan, and four in India. The Agency assesses life extension and decommissioning strategies for ageing nuclear power plants. At January 2024 there were 209 decommissioned reactors in a state of permanent shutdown (including 41 in the USA, 36 in the United Kingdom, 33 in Germany, and 27 in Japan). The IAEA helps developing member states to introduce nuclear-powered electricity generating plants through assistance with planning, feasibility studies, surveys of manpower and infrastructure, and safety measures. New facilities are designed with advance decommissioning and waste management plans, with a circular economy focus. The Agency’s Site and External Events Design (SEED) review service, launched in 2009, supports member states in the early stages of their nuclear power programme development with establishing suitable regulations to harmonize safety initiatives, and with swiftly identifying potential site hazards. IAEA also undertakes long-term operational SALTO (Safety Aspects of Long Term Operation) review missions. The IAEA issues publications on numerous aspects of nuclear power, and provides training courses on safety in nuclear power plants and other topics. An energy data bank collects and disseminates information on nuclear technology, and the Agency’s Power Reactor Information System maintains data on nuclear plants worldwide. </p>
               <p usage="ewyb edio eerca">In 2010 the IAEA established an Integrated Nuclear Infrastructure Group, which aimed to integrate information from disparate databases to enable more effective planning; to offer training in the use of planning tools; to provide legislative assistance; and to provide guidance on ensuring self-assessment capabilities among governmental and operating organizations. Integrated Nuclear Infrastructure Review (INIR) missions are conducted in member states by experts, site visits, interviews and analysis.</p>
               <p usage="eerca">In March 2020 an IAEA INIR mission was undertaken to Belarus, to review the status of the national nuclear power infrastructure in advance of the initiation in November of operations at its first nuclear power plant, built with Russian funding and support at Ostrovets. In May 2021 the IAEA initiated an INIR to assess the safety of Uzbekistan’s nuclear energy programme.</p>
               <p>The IAEA has since 1992 been actively engaged in the process to develop an International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), to expand the use of fusion energy. The ITER International Organization—inaugurated in October 2007, and at 2024 comprising the European Union (EU), China, India, Japan, South Korea, Russia, and the USA—has responsibility for constructing, operating and decommissioning the reactor. The construction phase commenced in 2010, in Saint-Paul-lez-Durance, France, and it was originally envisaged that the reactor would enter into operation in December 2025. The IAEA is a permanent observer at the Generation IV International Forum (GIF), which was inaugurated in 2000 to undertake research and development activities aimed at developing the feasibility and performance capabilities of next generation nuclear energy systems, which are expected to become commercially available during 2030-40. GIF member countries adopted the Framework Agreement for International Collaboration on Research and Development of Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems in 2005, and in February 2015 this was extended for a further 10 years.</p>
               <p>An International Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles (INPRO), which in 2024 had 44 members (43 IAEA member states and the European Commission), aims to promote nuclear energy as a means of meeting future sustainable energy requirements and to facilitate the exchange of information by member states to advance innovation in nuclear technology. The inaugural Nuclear Energy Summit, co-organized by the IAEA Director-General in March 2024, in Brussels, Belgium, focused on the potential of nuclear energy to address global challenges, including the need to sustain energy security while eliminating the consumption of fossil fuels.</p>
               <p usage="edio eerca">In 2010 the Executive Board endorsed the establishment of a low enriched uranium (LEU) Bank, representing a mechanism of last resort, to be used (upon advance payment) by national authorities unable to secure LEU either from the commercial market or state-to-state arrangements. The LEU Bank, based in Astana, Kazakhstan, became operational in October 2019, and was declared fully stocked in June 2020.</p>

An Atoms4Food initiative, launched in October 2023, uses nuclear techniques and other advanced technologies to enhance agricultural output and livestock health, strengthen natural resources management, increase food safety, limit food losses, ensure food safety, enrich nutrition, and support climate change adaptation. The programmes are implemented by the Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture and by the FAO/IAEA Agriculture and Biotechnology Laboratory, based at the IAEA’s Seibersdorf complex in Austria. A new Insect Pest Control Laboratory was inaugurated at Seibersdorf in October 2019 (under a scheme to modernize the complex—the ReNuAL initiative). An IAEA Marine Environment Laboratory (IAEA-MEL), based in Monaco, studies radionuclides and other ocean pollutants. An Ocean Acidification International Coordination Centre (OA-ICC) was established in 2012, under the management of IAEA-MEL, to facilitate, promote and communicate global actions on ocean acidification.

               <p>The IAEA encourages international co-operation in the exchange of information, promoting implementation of its safety standards and providing advisory safety services. It includes the IAEA International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale (INES), which measures the severity of nuclear events, incidents and accidents; the Incident Reporting System; an emergency preparedness programme (which maintains an Incident and Emergency Centre, located in Vienna, and a 41-member Response and Assistance Network—RANET); operational safety review teams; the International Nuclear Safety Group (INSAG); the Radiation Protection Advisory Team; and a safety research co-ordination programme.</p>
               <p>The nuclear safety programme promotes a global safety regime, which aims to ensure the protection of people and the environment from the effects of ionizing radiation and the minimization of the likelihood of potential nuclear accidents. A Commission on Safety Standards establishes IAEA nuclear, radiation, transport and waste safety standards and provides for their application. In January 2004 the IAEA issued a revised Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources. In September 2006 the IAEA published a primary safety standard, the Fundamental Safety Principles. The Agency established a Global Safety Assessment Network (GSAN) in 2010, facilitating collaboration between experts worldwide with the aim of harmonizing nuclear safety. </p>
               <p>Ministers or senior representatives of 140 member states attended the 2020 IAEA International Conference on Nuclear Security, held in February, in Vienna, which concluded with a declaration expressing renewed commitment to enhancing global nuclear security and countering the threat of nuclear terrorism and other malicious acts. A new Nuclear Security Plan, covering the period 2022-25, was formulated on the basis of recommendations concluded at the Conference; it was approved by the Board of Governors in September 2021.</p>
               <p>From March 2020 the IAEA offered support to member states in managing nuclear and radiation facilities and activities, and implementing safeguards to prevent the misuse of nuclear material, over the course of the COVID-19 emergency. A COVID-19 Operational Experience (OPEX) Network was launched by the Agency to facilitate the sharing of pandemic-related information by nuclear power plant operators and regulators.</p>
               <p>The Agency provides practical help to member states in the management of radioactive waste. The Waste Management Advisory Programme was established in 1987, and undertakes advis­ory missions in member states. A code of practice to prevent the illegal dumping of radioactive waste was drafted in 1989, and another on the international transboundary movement of waste was drafted in 1990.</p>
               <p usage="ewyb edio">A ban on the dumping of radioactive waste at sea came into effect in 1994, under the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matters; the IAEA was to determine radioactive levels, for purposes of the Convention, and to provide assistance to countries for the safe disposal of radioactive wastes. A new category of radioactive waste—very low level waste (VLLW)—was introduced in the early 2000s. A VLLW repository, at Morvilliers, France, became fully operational in 2004. The Agency has issued modal regulations for the air, sea and land transportation of all radioactive materials.</p>
               <p>
        In September 1997 the IAEA adopted a Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management (the first internationally binding legal device to address such issues). The Convention was to ensure the safe storage and disposal of nuclear and radioactive waste, during both the construction and operation of a nuclear power plant, as well as following its closure. The Convention entered into force in June 2001, and had been ratified by 90 parties at January 2024. An International Conference on Management of Spent Fuel from Nuclear Power Reactors, aimed at reviewing best practices in that area, was to be held in June 2024, at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna. (A first such conference had been convened in by the IAEA in June 2019.) In January 2022 the IAEA issued a report titled 
        <publ-name>Status and Trends in Spent Fuel and Radioactive Waste Management,</publ-name>
         which noted significant progress in safe management, including through the development of deep geological repositories.
      </p>
               <p>A Spent Fuel and Radioactive Waste Information System (SRIS) database was launched in June 2020 to provide an integrated overview of national and global spent fuel and radioactive waste inventories and of related policies and regulatory regimes. An International Radiation Monitoring System (IRMIS), with 50 member states in 2024, maps real-time information on radiation levels.</p>

               <p>The Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material (CPPNM), signed in 1980, commits contracting states to ensuring the protection of nuclear material during transportation within their territory or on board their ships or aircraft. A CPPNM Amendment, aimed at reducing the risk of terrorist attacks against nuclear installations, entered into force on 8 May 2016. IAEA International Physical Protection Advisory Service (IPPAS) teams review national nuclear security practices; by 31 December 2023 102 IPPAS missions had been undertaken since the Service commenced in 1995. An International Conference on Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources was held in June 2022, in Vienna.</p>
               <p>Following a devastating accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine (then part of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) in April 1986, two conventions were formulated by the IAEA and entered into force in October. The Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident commits parties to provide information about nuclear accidents with possible transboundary effects at the earliest opportunity (it had 133 parties by January 2024); and the Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency commits parties to endeavour to provide assistance in the event of a nuclear accident or radiological emergency (this had 128 parties by January 2024).</p>
               <p usage="eerca">The last of the Chernobyl plant's three operating units was officially closed in December 2000. During the 2000s the IAEA offered a wide range of assistance with the decommissioning of Chernobyl. In April 2021 the Ukrainian authorities authorized the operational phase of a new Interim Storage Facility (ISF-2), in which spent nuclear fuel from the Chernobyl plant’s three undamaged reactors was to be stored. Also in that month, the inaugural assembly meeting was held of a new International Chernobyl Cooperation Account (ICCA), through which the IAEA and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development were to continue to support Ukraine’s nuclear containment activities.</p>
               <p>At the beginning of March 2022, following Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine, the IAEA Director-General urged restraint, stating concern over the potential threat to the safety of that country’s four operational nuclear plants and to other radioactive materials and nuclear facilities, including the closed Chernobyl site. Respect for seven core safety principles (`Seven Pillars’) was emphasized by the IAEA as paramount during conflict: (i) maintenance of the physical integrity of all nuclear facilities; (ii) full functioning at all times of all safety and security systems and equipment; (iii) full freedom for operating staff to fulfil their safety and security duties; (iv) maintenance of a continuous secure off-site power supply from the grid for all nuclear sites; (v) uninterrupted logistical supply chains and transportation to and from all sites; (vi) the continuation of effective radiation monitoring systems and emergency preparedness and response measures; and (vii) reliable communications.</p>
               <p usage="ewyb edio eerca">Chernobyl and the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant (ZNPP—the largest nuclear plant in Europe, located in southeastern Ukraine) were swiftly taken by the Russian forces. The Director-General expressed grave concern that the ZNPP management was under orders from a Russian military commander—contravening a core principle of nuclear safety and security—and that most lines of communication with Ukraine’s nuclear regulatory authority had been cut. At the beginning of April 2022 it was reported that the Chernobyl plant had been transferred back to overall Ukrainian control. The IAEA’s RANET was tasked with co-ordinating international support to meet the equipment requirements to secure the operation of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities. In April and late May, at the request of the Ukrainian authorities, the IAEA sent expert missions to monitor nuclear safety, safeguards and security activities at the Chernobyl plant. In mid-July—through RANET—the IAEA delivered a large consignment of critical radiation monitoring and protection items to Ukraine (that had been provided by Australia and France). Meanwhile, the IAEA and the Ukrainian technicians at the ZNPP (which remained under Russian overall control) jointly worked to overcome sporadic interruptions to the remote transmission of safeguards data from the ZNPP to the IAEA’s Vienna headquarters.</p>
               <p usage="ewyb edio eerca">
        In early August 2022 the IAEA Director-General stated extreme concern over military shelling of the ZNPP. (Each party to the conflict accused the other of shelling the plant, while Ukraine accused the Russian military both of storing weaponry there and of using the plant as a launch base for military offensives.) The Director-General emphasized the real risk of triggering a catastrophic nuclear—and public health and environmental—disaster, and strongly condemned all violent acts perpetrated at or near the plant. The UN Secretary-General, meanwhile, demanded that IAEA inspectors should be given access to the ZNPP. At that time 10 of Ukraine’s 15 operational nuclear reactors (across its four operational plants) were reported by the IAEA to be connected to the national grid, including two at the Khmelnytskyy plant and three at Rivne (both in western Ukraine), three at the South Ukraine plant, and two at Zaporizhzhya. It was, however, reported later in that month that, following fires at the ZNPP, its two reactors had been disconnected from the grid. An IAEA Support and Assistance Mission to Zaporizhzhya (ISAMZ) arrived at the plant on 1 September. The Director-General confirmed at that time that the plant’s physical integrity had been violated on several occasions. On 10 September five of Zaporizhzhya’s six reactors were placed in cold shut down. The sixth reactor was placed in hot shut down (to generate steam to enable the continuation of onsite safety processes). On 1 October the Director-General demanded clarification from the Russian authorities over the reported detention by the Russian military of the civilian Ukrainian head of the ZNPP facility. On the previous day President Putin of Russia had declared four regions, including Zaporizhzhya, to be incorporated henceforth into Russia. The ISAMZ team remained at the dormant facility, and reported on frequent repairs to its last remaining external back up power line (necessary to ensure safety and security), this having been repeatedly damaged by military shelling. From January 2023, a continuous IAEA staff presence was maintained at five further Ukrainian nuclear sites. A report issued in February by the Agency titled 
        <publ-name>Nuclear Safety, Security and Safeguards in Ukraine</publ-name>
         addressed the developments of the past 12 months. On 1 March the last functioning back-up power line to the ZNPP was damaged—from which time the plant was reliant on one 750 kV transmission line, and, should that fail, on a series of 20 diesel generators. At the end of May, addressing the UN Security Council, the IAEA Director-General issued five basic principles concerning safety at the ZNPP: there should be no attack of any kind from or against the plant; the plant should not be used as storage or a base for heavy weapons, or for military personnel; off-site power to the plant should not be put at risk; all components essential to the safe and secure operation of the plant should be protected; and no actions should be taken that undermine the principles. In early June—in view of massive disruption caused by the conflict-related destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam on the Dnipro river—the Director-General stated that IAEA experts would need to assess potential impacts on the ZNPP of ensuing changes to water levels in the Kakhovka reservoir, which supplies water to cool the facility’s six reactors and spent fuel storage. He led an IAEA safety assessment team to the site later in that month. At the beginning of December the IAEA Director-General reported that, for the eighth time since the onset of the conflict, the ZNPP facility had suffered a total loss of external power (lasting several hours), and had been forced to rely on its emergency diesel generators. In February 2024 the IAEA Director-General met with Ukraine’s President Zelensky to discuss nuclear safety, prior to undertaking his fourth visit to the ZNPP since the onset of the conflict. In March he met with President Vladimir Putin to discuss the security risks at the plant. In early April IAEA experts confirmed the presence of remnants of drone detonations at three impact locations at the site. The direct targeting of the ZNPP, in violation of the five basic principles concerning safety there, was condemned by the Director-General.

          In October 2008 the IAEA inaugurated the International Seismic Safety Centre to serve as a focal point for avoiding and mitigating the consequences of extreme seismic events on nuclear installations worldwide. In March 2011, in the aftermath of the severe earthquake and tsunami flooding that had struck and severely damaged the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, the Japanese authorities requested IAEA support in monitoring the effects of the ensuing release of radiation on the environment and on human health. Accordingly, the IAEA dispatched monitoring teams to Japan to provide assistance to local experts, with a particular focus on: worker radiation protection; food safety; marine and soil science; and Boiling Water Reactor technology. During late May-early June an IAEA team comprising 20 international experts visited Japan to assess the ongoing state of nuclear safety in that country. The emergency phase of the Fukushima accident ended with the attainment of Cold Shutdown Condition, in mid-December. In January-February 2013 the IAEA organized an International Experts' Meeting on Decommissioning and Remediation After a Nuclear Accident. In February 2014 the IAEA presented an independent assessment, compiled at the request of the Japanese authorities, of that country’s ongoing Mid- and Long-Term Roadmap towards decommissioning the power plant. During the period 2011-15 the IAEA issued weekly status reports on the situation at Fukushima Daiichi, covering environmental radiation monitoring by the Japanese authorities (mainly of locally sampled seawater); workers’ exposure to radiation; and ongoing conditions at the plant. In August 2015 the IAEA Director-General’s definitive 
          <publ-name>Report on the Fukushima Daiichi Accident</publ-name>
          , accompanied by five related technical volumes produced by international experts, was released. In November 2018 a team of IAEA experts completed a fourth review mission addressing the Fukushima decommissioning process. The fifth IAEA review mission, undertaken during late June-late August 2021, noted that significant challenges remained, including with regard to the retrieval of debris and radioactive waste and the removal of spent fuel. In September the inaugural meeting was convened of a new expert Task Force, established by the Agency to conducted a detailed 
          
          review with regard to the safety of water release (by means of a proposed Advanced Liquid Processing System—ALPS) at the Fukushima Daiichi plant. In February 2022 the Task Force undertook the first of a series of missions to Japan, during which it analysed technical data and collected water samples. In May 2023 the IAEA issued a 
          <publ-name>First Interlaboratory Comparison on the Determination of Radionuclides in ALPS Treated Water</publ-name>
          , which stated that the operators of the Fukushima Daiichi facility had demonstrated their efficiency in making precise measurements of the radionuclides present in treated water stored there. In early July the IAEA concluded that the proposed discharge of ALPS treated water was consistent with international safety standards and would have a `negligible’ impact on humans or on the environment. An IAEA Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station Office, inaugurated in that month, was tasked with monitoring the safety of the discharge phase—which was to be conducted over a period lasting around 30 years. The Japanese authorities initiated the discharge on 24 August. The Task Force’s first full safety review of the conduct of the discharge programme, issued in January 2024, found it to be adhering to agreed safety standards. In February Japan informed the IAEA about the recent detection of a leakage of water containing radioactive materials from a caesium absorption tower at the Fukushima plant.

               <p>The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (known also as the Non-Proliferation Treaty or NPT), which entered into force in 1970, designates five `nuclear weapon states’—China, France, Russia, the UK and the USA—which have expressed commitment to the ultimate goal of complete nuclear disarmament under effective international controls. At January 2024 the five nuclear weapon states and 186 non-nuclear weapon states were parties to the NPT. The Treaty requires each member `non-nuclear weapon state' (one which had not manufactured and exploded a nuclear weapon or other nuclear explosive device prior to 1 January 1967) to conclude a comprehensive safeguards agreement (CSA) with the IAEA. Under a CSA the state undertakes to accept IAEA safeguards on all nuclear material in its peaceful nuclear activities for the purpose of verifying that such material is not diverted to weaponry or other nuclear explosive devices. The five nuclear weapon states have concluded safeguards agreements with the Agency that permit the application of IAEA safeguards to all their nuclear activities, excluding those with `direct national significance'. NPT review conferences are normally held at five-yearly intervals (2022: in August). A Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) was opened for signature in September 1996, but is not yet in force. A Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW), adopted in September 2017, entered into force on 22 January 2021. </p>

               <p>To enable the Agency to conclude that all nuclear material in a state is channelled towards peaceful activities both a CSA and an Additional Protocol to the CSA must be in effect. Additional Protocols, which were introduced from 1997, bind member states to provide inspection teams with improved access to information concerning existing and planned nuclear activities, and to allow access to locations other than known nuclear sites within the country's territory. At March 2024 IAEA safeguards agreements had been concluded with 189 states and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom), while 141 states and Euratom had ratified Additional Protocols to their safeguards agreements. Integrated Safety Assessments of Research Reactors (INSARR) missions are conducted in member states, on the basis of IAEA safety standards, and, during 2012, a programme of complementary Operation and Maintenance Assessment for Research Reactors (OMARR) missions was initiated. In July 2022 the Agency conducted its first Integrated Research Reactor Utilization Review (IRRUR) mission (at La Reina Nuclear Centre, Santiago, Chile), focused on maximizing benefit from the use of research reactors.

                    <p usage="ewyb edio fea">In January 2003 North Korea (which had withdrawn from the IAEA in 1994) announced its withdrawal also from the NPT, while stating that it would limit its nuclear activities to peaceful purposes. In August a series of talks on the situation was launched, involving North Korea, China, Japan, South Korea, Russia and the USA. In September 2005 the six parties signed a joint statement in which North Korea determined to resume its adherence to the NPT and Agency safeguards, and not to develop nuclear weapons; the five other parties recognized North Korea’s right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, and South Korea and the USA both stated that they would not deploy nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula. In July 2006 the UN Security Council condemned a recent ballistic missile test by North Korea, and urged that country to return immediately to the six-party talks without precondition. In October the IAEA Director-General expressed strong concern in response to an announcement by North Korea that it had conducted a nuclear test. Meanwhile, the Security Council demanded that North Korea suspend all activities related to its ballistic missile programme, abandon all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programmes, abandon all other existing weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programmes in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner, and return to the six-party talks. The talks were resumed in February 2007, and resulted in an ad hoc agreement that North Korea would shut down and seal its nuclear facility at Yongbyon (north of the capital, Pyongyang), and would invite back IAEA personnel to conduct all necessary monitoring and verifications; that North Korea would discuss with the other parties a list of all its nuclear programmes; that it would enter into negotiations with the USA and Japan aimed at normalizing diplomatic relations; and that the USA would initiate the process of removing the designation of North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism. In July an IAEA team visited the country and verified the shutdown of the Yongbyon facility. Upon the resumption of the six-party talks in September, the participants adopted an agreement wherein North Korea resolved permanently to disable its nuclear facilities. In July 2008 the talks agreed that a verification regime should be established, that the disablement of North Korea’s Yongbyon nuclear facilities should be completed, and that assistance equivalent to 1m. tons of heavy fuel oil should be delivered to North Korea.</p>
                    <p usage="fea">In August 2008 the North Korean authorities announced their intention to reactivate the Yongbyon facility in given the refusal, hitherto, of the USA to remove the country from its terrorism blacklist. In September the IAEA reported that all Agency seals and surveillance equipment had been removed from Yongbyon, and that North Korea would no longer sanction visits by IAEA inspectors to the reprocessing facility; this decision was reversed in the following month, shortly after the conclusion of an agreement between North Korea and the USA on measures aimed at verifying North Korea's denuclearization, and the US Government's subsequent removal of North Korea from its terrorism blacklist.</p>
                    <p usage="ewyb edio fea">In April 2009 a long-range rocket test conducted by North Korea was unanimously condemned by the UN Security Council. North Korea responded by announcing its withdrawal from the six-party talks and from the ad hoc agreement concerning the Yongbyon facility and ceasing, with immediate effect, all co-operation with the IAEA. Thereafter (and ongoing in 2024) the IAEA continued to monitor North Korean facilities from afar, by means of satellite imagery and other open source information. A further nuclear test conducted by North Korea in May 2009 was deplored by the Council, which, in June (in Resolution 1874) strengthened the sanctions regime against that country (these were subsequently progressively further tightened). It was announced in February 2012 that North Korea, under the new leadership of President Kim Jong Un since December 2011, had agreed to suspend uranium enrichment and nuclear testing, and to permit the return of IAEA inspectors, in return for significant provision of food aid. In April 2012, however, the Security Council condemned a failed long-range missile launch, which North Korea declared to be an attempt to send a satellite into orbit. In August the IAEA reported that satellite imagery indicated that North Korea had made significant progress in the construction of a light water atomic reactor with the potential to extend the country’s capacity to produce material for the construction of nuclear weapons. In February 2014 North Korean state media announced that an underground nuclear detonation had been conducted at the Punggye-ri nuclear testing facility (in northeastern North Korea). The IAEA Director-General reported in June 2016 that North Korea appeared to have reactivated plutonium enrichment or reprocessing operations at the Yongbyon complex. In September 2017 the UN Secretary-General strongly condemned an underground nuclear test—the sixth since 2006, and reportedly the most large-scale—that was undertaken at that time at Punggye-ri. Stating that it had proven its nuclear capabilities, North Korea announced a suspension of nuclear tests and missile launches from 21 April 2018. In late April President Kim and the then South Korean President Moon Jae-In met in Panmunjom, in the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two countries, and made a joint commitment to co-operate closely with a view to eliminating nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula. In June the IAEA Director-General welcomed a Joint Statement agreed by Kim and US President Trump at a bilateral summit meeting held in Singapore, which included a reaffirmation of the recent Panmunjom Declaration. Meanwhile, in August the IAEA Director-General reported on further developments of `grave concern’ in North Korea’s nuclear programme, including in relation to the Yongbyon Experimental Nuclear Power Plant Reactor and the use of a building accommodating an alleged centrifuge enrichment facility. A second Kim-Trump meeting, held in February 2019, in Viet Nam, did not result in further commitments. However, North Korea was to continue to suspend nuclear and missile tests, and the USA was to refrain from participating in joint military exercises with South Korea. In March the IAEA reported that satellite imagery indicated that the Yongbyon reactor appeared to have been closed since early December 2018. In May 2019 North Korea resumed launches of short-range ballistic missiles. Presidents Kim and Trump met for a third time in the following month, in Panmunjom, and determined that nuclear de-escalation negotiations would restart. North Korea conducted multiple weapons tests during July-early October. In October North Korea launched an apparent submarine-mounted ballistic missile towards Japan’s EEZ.</p>
                    <p usage="ewyb edio fea">On 1 January 2020 President Kim announced the end of his regime’s suspension of nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) tests (this not having been reciprocated by the withdrawal of international economic sanctions) and stated that a new strategic weapon was under development by North Korea. In March North Korea fired two missiles towards the Sea of Japan, the first test launches of that year. Reporting to the Board of Governors in June, the IAEA Director-General noted that the Agency continued to monitor North Korea’s nuclear programme using open source information, such as satellite imagery, and that no notable recent changes had been observed. In March 2021 the IAEA Director-General stated that there were some indications of activity at North Korean nuclear facilities, that the country’s nuclear programme remained a cause for serious concern, and that the IAEA was standing ready to verify it. In June the IAEA reported possible indications that reprocessing activities (to separate plutonium from spent reactor fuel) were underway at the Yongbyon nuclear complex. At the end of August the Agency stated that since July there had been indications—such as the presence of discharged cooling water—that the Yongbyon reactor was operational.</p>
                    <p usage="ewyb edio fea">In late January 2022 North Korea launched an intermediate range Hwasong-12 missile over the Sea of Japan—reportedly its largest missile launch since 2017. A more robust defence policy outlined by the newly installed South Korean President, Yoon Suk-Yeol, who took office in May 2022, was reported to have intensified intra-Korean tensions. During that year a record total of more than 90 missiles were reportedly launched by North Korea, including ICBMs. In March 2023 North Korea reportedly fired an ICBM in advance of a pivotal summit meeting in Tokyo, Japan, between Yoon Suk-Yeol and Fumio Kishida, the Japanese Prime Minister. In June the IAEA’s Director-General noted a recent significant increase in construction work at Yongbyon, and emphasized his deep concern over the re-opening of the Punggye-ri nuclear test site. North Korea tested advanced solid-fueled ICBMs in July and December, and in January and March 2024 tested hypersonic components of ICBMs. During March the Director-General stated strong support for an expression of interest by Fumio Kishida in holding a summit with President Kim `without preconditions’.</p>

In May the IAEA Director-General, at the request of the UN Security Council, issued a report that concluded there remained several areas of serious concern with regard to Iran, including an ongoing `green salt' project; high explosives testing; a missile re-entry vehicle project; some procurement activities of military-related institutions; outstanding substantive explanations regarding information with a possible military dimension; and Iran's continuing enrichment-related ­activities. In November 2009 the IAEA Board of Governors adopted a resolution urging Iran to suspend immediately construction of a uranium enrichment facility at the Fordow underground site near Qom. An IAEA report issued in February 2010 stated that, while the IAEA continued to verify the non-diversion of declared nuclear material in Iran, the Iranian authorities had not provided the necessary degree of co-operation to enable the Agency to confirm that all nuclear material in Iran was not being diverted for military purposes.</p>

          In November 2011 the IAEA Board of Governors adopted a resolution expressing `deep and increasing concern’ over the unresolved issues regarding the Iranian nuclear programme and calling upon Iran to engage seriously and without preconditions in discussions aimed at restoring international confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear activities. With a view to intensifying dialogue, senior IAEA experts visited Iran in January-February 2012. The IAEA team was denied access to the military complex at Parchin, south-east of Tehran, the Iranian capital, which was suspected to be the site of an explosives containment vessel, and clarification of unresolved issues relating to possible military dimensions of Iran’s nuclear programme was not achieved. In late February IAEA reported that the installation of centrifuges at the Natanz (uranium enrichment) Fuel Plant, in central Iran, had accelerated and more generally that uranium enrichment had increased three-fold since late 2011. (The Iranian authorities, however, insisted that this material was required for a medical research reactor.) Several rounds of talks between representatives of the IAEA and the Iranian authorities on developing a structured approach to communications were convened from May 2012-September 2013, and, in November, the IAEA and Iran agreed a Joint Statement on a Framework for Co-operation. In January 2014 the IAEA Board of Governors endorsed an interim joint plan of action with Iran, that had been concluded later in November 2013 by the Governments of France, Germany and the UK (the `E3’) plus China, Russia and the USA (the E3/EU+3, also known as the P5+1), under which the IAEA—pending the conclusion of a `long-term comprehensive solution’ aimed at ensuring that Iran’s nuclear programme remained exclusively peaceful—was to monitor and verify an initial series of voluntary measures that were to be implemented by Iran and reviewed at quarterly intervals. (These measures included the suspension of several nuclear activities, in exchange for an easing of the international sanctions regime.) Iran and the E3/EU+3 subsequently held several rounds of negotiations to determine the text of a final comprehensive accord. In July 2014 the interim joint plan of action, providing for continuing monitoring activities, was extended until November, and in that month it was further extended, until 30 June 2015. In early April the so-called Lausanne Agreement was adopted, providing a political framework for the final stage of negotiations. Under the Agreement it was envisaged, 
          <i>inter alia</i>
          , that Iran would refrain from making nuclear weapons, and that the Fordow facility would be transformed into a centre for nuclear physics. In late June the deadline for the conclusion of negotiations was extended into July, and in mid-July an agreement (the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action—JCPOA) was finally reached by Iran and the E3/EU+3, under which Iran made a commitment to restrict its nuclear programme (to be monitored by the IAEA) in return for the withdrawal of sanctions; the accord provided, however, for these to be reinstated within 65 days should Iran fail to meet its obligations. At the same time, the IAEA (which was not itself a party to the JCPOA) and the Iranian authorities agreed a roadmap aimed at improving mutual relations. Later in July the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 2231, which endorsed the JCPOA and its provisions. In December the IAEA Board of Governors adopted a `Final Assessment on Past and Present Outstanding Issues Regarding Iran’s Nuclear Programme’. In mid-January 2016 the IAEA Secretary-General submitted a report simultaneously to the IAEA Board of Governors and to the UN Security Council, in which he confirmed that IAEA inspectors had verified that Iran had undertaken all required initial measures, thereby marking the so-called Implementation Day of the JCPOA. Accordingly, sanctions previously authorized by the Security Council were withdrawn and superseded by the provisions of the JCPOA. Thereafter, Iran was to commence implementation of the Additional Protocol to its Safeguards Agreement with the Agency. At Iran’s largest gas centrifuge uranium enrichment facility—the Natanz Fuel Plant—the IAEA was to use an Online Enrichment Monitor to verify that uranium enrichment levels did not (as stipulated under the JCPOA) exceed 3.67%. In August 2017 the IAEA reported that Iran was continuing to implement its nuclear-related commitments under the JCPOA. None the less, in October US President Trump—unilaterally alleging non-compliance by Iran and dissatisfaction with certain provisions of the JCPOA—announced that he would no longer automatically certify the accord every 90 days (a domestic requirement stipulated by the US Congress). In January 2018 President Trump stated that the USA would withdraw its participation from the arrangement following the end of the next 90-day period, if significant amendments were not made. The other signatories, meanwhile, expressed their continuing full commitment to implementing the existing JCPOA, and the IAEA Director-General reiterated that Iran had hitherto been found to be adhering to its related obligations. On 8 May President Trump announced that the USA would terminate its participation in the JCPOA, and initiated the process of reinstating US sanctions against Iran. On the following day the IAEA Director-General once again emphasized that IAEA verifying and monitoring teams had found Iran to be implementing its commitments under the JCPOA, and noted that the agreement represented the world’s most robust existing nuclear verification regime. The UN Secretary-General announced deep concern at the US decision, stressing that the JCPOA had contributed to regional and international peace and security, and that concerns relating to the agreement’s implementation should be addressed through relevant related mechanisms. In June the IAEA Director-General affirmed that the Agency was continuing to monitor and verify Iran’s non-diversion of nuclear material (as requested by the UN Security Council), and subsequently, in his quarterly reports issued through to March 2019, stressed that Iran was continuing to implement its nuclear-related commitments under the JCPOA.

                    <p usage="ewyb edio mena">In May 2019, in response to the US sanctions regime and against a background of escalating diplomatic tensions, Iran announced that it was to scale down the implementation of its JCPOA commitments. In the following month the IAEA Director-General noted that Iran’s production of low-enriched uranium had increased, although at that time it remained within the (300&#160;kg) limit established by the JCPOA. He urged dialogue to resolve the situation. On 1 July it was reported that the 300&#160;kg cap had been exceeded. In November the acting IAEA Director-General reported to the Board of Governors that Iran had recently initiated uranium enrichment activities at its Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant in Natanz and at the Fordow facility. By December nine countries (France, Germany and the UK—the founding members, and Belgium, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden) had joined a so-called Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges (Instex) clearing house mechanism that aimed to provide an alternative channel to the use of the US currency in trade with Iran, as a means of bypassing the US sanctions against that country (in support of the JCPOA).</p>
                    <p usage="ewyb edio mena">In early January 2020, following the assassination in Baghdad, Iraq, by a US air strike, of General Qassem Soleimani, commander of the Quds Force unit of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps, Iran announced that it was to withdraw fully from all commitments under the JCPOA and would henceforth enrich uranium at will, without limitations on levels or on research and development. Consequently, France, Germany and the UK activated the accord’s formal dispute resolution mechanism. In June the IAEA expressed serious concern that Iran was blocking inspectors’ access to its nuclear sites. Later in the month the IAEA Director-General reported to the Board of Governors that Iran had also not engaged in meaningful discussions relating to possible undeclared nuclear material and nuclear-related activities for more than a year. He urged the Iranian authorities to co-operate with the Agency. In early July the Agency was informed by Iran of a (resolved) fire at the Natanz uranium enrichment facility site. The UN sanctions regime against Iran ended, as scheduled, in mid-October. From September, however, the USA significantly tightened the imposition of punitive sanctions against Iran. The IAEA reported in October that Iran had initiated the construction of an underground advanced centrifuge assembly facility near Natanz, and in the following month the Agency reported evidence of enrichment activities using the sophisticated Natanz centrifuges (in violation of the JCPOA). At the beginning of January 2021 Iran informed the IAEA that, in accordance with national legislation (a so-called Strategic Action Plan to Counter Sanctions) that had been approved in December 2020, the Fordow facility was reinstating production of low enriched uranium up to a purity level of 20%, thereby reverting to the level of output achieved prior to the implementation of the JCPOA. On 11 February IAEA inspectors confirmed that Iran had recently produced uranium metal (a potential component of a nuclear bomb), in Isfahan; the Iranian authorities, however, stated that the metal had been made in the context of a research and development programme. On 21 February, with a view to facilitating constructive dialogue, the IAEA and the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) jointly stated that Iran would continue to implement its CSA with the Agency, and the Agency would continue to conduct basic monitoring activities for up to 3 months. From 23 February, however, Iran ceased to apply the Additional Protocol to its CSA, and barred the Agency from accessing data from surveillance equipment that had been installed at Iranian nuclear facilities to monitor the implementation of the JCPOA. A power cut that occurred at the Natanz complex in mid-April was described by the Iranian authorities as a cyber attack (and `act of nuclear terrorism’), and was alleged to have been perpetrated by Israel. Soon afterwards technical discussions were initiated between the Agency and Iran to clarify IAEA questions concerning the possible previous presence (reportedly prior to 2003) of nuclear material at undeclared sites. Broader talks aimed at reviving the JCPOA also continued. In May 2021 the temporary arrangement enabling the Agency to continue to monitor Iran’s CSA was extended for a further month, until 24 June—at which point the arrangement expired. In early September, during a visit by the IAEA Director-General to Tehran, he and the head of the AEOI determined to maintain contact between the two agencies, and agreed that the IAEA should be given access to install new memory cards and to service surveillance equipment at Iranian nuclear facilities. In mid-December agreement was reached between the Agency and the AEOI that provided for the renewed installation of surveillance cameras at Iran’s Karaj centrifuge component manufacturing site. In March 2022 the IAEA and the AEOI agreed a short-term plan of action aimed at clarifying outstanding issues (relating to the possible previous presence of nuclear material at undeclared sites) that were stalling the restoration of the JCPOA. Reporting to the Board of Governors in June, however, the IAEA Director-General stated that Iran had failed to provide technically credible accounts to resolve these matters, and urged that this should be redressed. In that month, at Iran’s request, the IAEA removed 27 cameras, and the other monitoring equipment, that it had previously installed in Iran to verify the implementation of the JCPOA. Following a visit undertaken by the IAEA Director-General to Iran in March 2023, he reported that Iran had stated its readiness to continue to co-operate on addressing outstanding safeguards issues (relating to three locations), and would permit the IAEA to implement further verification and monitoring activities. However, in June he noted to the Board of Governors that progress in this respect had been slow and that Iran’s total stockpile of enriched uranium was now more than 21 times the limit specified under the JCPOA. The E3 countries issued a joint statement at that time condemning Iran’s `unabated and dangerous’ escalation of its nuclear programme, while the Iranian authorities countered that they would approve further IAEA monitoring if all punitive sanctions against Iran were withdrawn. In September the Iranian authorities de-designated several IAEA inspectors.</p>
                    <p>While the IAEA had been unable to verify Iran’s enriched uranium stockpiles since 2021, as at 10 February 2024 the Agency estimated that Iran possessed a total enriched uranium stockpile that amounted to 5,525.5 kg (compared with 3,760.8 kg in February 2023, and with 1,020.9 kg in February 2020). This included 121.5 kg of uranium enriched up to 60% purity—approaching weapons grade (compared with 87.5 kg in February 2023). No explanation had reportedly thus far been given by Iran for particles enriched to 83.7% that had been observed in January 2023. In March 2024 the Director-General emphasized that the agency had lost full continuity of knowledge in relation to Iran’s nuclear programme and stated deep regret over the Iranian authorities’ continuing de-designation of a number of IAEA inspectors.</p>

               <p>The IAEA provides assistance in the form of experts, training and equipment to technical co-operation projects and applications worldwide, with an emphasis on radiation protection and safety-related activities. In 2020 the IAEA extended technical co-operation assistance to 146 countries and territories (including 35 developed countries), in the principal areas of nuclear knowledge development and management, health and nutrition, food and agriculture, and nuclear safety and security. The IAEA supported the foundation in September 2003 of the World Nuclear University, comprising a global network of institutions that aim to strengthen international co-operation in promoting the safe use of nuclear power in energy production, and in the application of nuclear science and technology in areas including sustainable agriculture and nutrition, medicine, fresh water resources management and environmental protection. An annual IAEA Scientific Forum is held (2023: in September, in Vienna). The IAEA’s Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fellowship Programme aims to support women’s participation in the nuclear workforce. Through a new IAEA Lise Meitner Programme that was initiated in March 2023, career development for women professionals in the nuclear sector was to be supported.</p>
