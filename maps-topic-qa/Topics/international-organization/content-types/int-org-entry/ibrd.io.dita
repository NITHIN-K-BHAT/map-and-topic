      IBRD was established in December 1945. Initially, it was concerned with post-Second World War reconstruction in Europe; since then its aim has been to assist the economic development of members by making loans where private capital is not available on reasonable terms to finance productive investments. The World Bank, as it is commonly known, comprises IBRD and the 
      <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-UN.1952">International Development Association</xr>
       (IDA). The affiliated group of institutions, comprising IBRD, IDA, the International Finance Corporation (

               <p>There are 25 Executive Directors and each Director selects an Alternate.

          <p id="IO-UN.1914">The World Bank's primary `twin objectives’ are the achievement of sustainable economic growth and prosperity, and the reduction of extreme poverty in developing countries. Extreme poverty is defined by the Bank through its Multidimensional Poverty Measure (MPM), which takes into account monetary poverty: living on less than US&#8201;$2.15 per day, and also deprivations in access to basic infrastructure (sanitation, drinking water and electricity) and to education. From 2014/15, in order to support individual countries in pursuing the twin objectives by 2030, the Bank introduced a new country engagement model with a focus on tailoring and targeting support selectively through newly established Country Partnership Frameworks. Jointly with the IMF the Bank undertakes national financial sector assessment reviews, aimed at identifying and rectifying vulnerabilities in financial systems.</p>
          <p>In October 2013 the Board of Governors approved the first WBG Strategy to guide and co-ordinate activities across all the member agencies of the Group; the new WBG operating model was inaugurated on 1 July 2014. The Strategy grouped the Bank’s technical experts into specialized Global Practices. As at 2024 the Bank’s Global Practices were: Agriculture; Education; Energy; Environment and Natural Resources; Extractive Industries; Finance, Competitiveness and Innovation; Governance; Health, Nutrition and Population; Human Development; Jobs and Development; Macroeconomics, Trade and Investment; Poverty; Social Protection; Social Sustainability and Inclusion; Urban, Disaster Risk, Resilience, and Land; Transport; Digital Development; and Water. Cross-cutting global themes in 2024 were: climate change; fragility, conflict and violence (FCV); gender; infrastructure; and knowledge management. In October 2022 the Bank initiated a process to develop an Evolution Roadmap for the WBG, to reform its approach to meeting 21st century challenges and development requirements.</p>
          <p>
      In January 2024 the Bank’s 
      <publ-name>Global Economic Prospects</publ-name>
       forecast that the expansion of global trade during 2024 would be about one-half of average growth in the decade that preceded the COVID-19 pandemic. Growth in GDP of 2.6% had been reported in 2023; it was envisaged that this would decelerate to 2.4% in 2024. Developing economies’ borrowing costs were expected to remain high.

               <p id="IO-UN.1910">IBRD capital is derived from members' subscriptions to capital shares, the calculation of which is based on their quotas in the IMF. At 30 June 2023 the total subscribed capital of IBRD was US&#8201;$317,840m., of which the paid-in portion was $21,819m. (7%); the remainder was subject to call if required. In April 2018 the Development Committee endorsed a package of measures that included a series of internal organizational reforms within the WBG, and new policies aimed at strengthening the Group’s operational effectiveness (including a shift in the focus of lending to poorer member states). In October the Board of Governors endorsed an increase of $52,600m. in IBRD’s callable capital and of $7,500m. in the paid-in portion. A temporary expansion of IBRD lending at times of global financial crisis was agreed. It was envisaged that the financing capacity of the WBG would increase from around $60,000m. annually to $100,000m. by 2030. Most of IBRD's lendable funds come from its borrowing, on commercial terms, in world capital markets, and also from its retained earnings and the flow of repayments on its loans. IBRD loans carry a variable interest rate, rather than a rate fixed at the time of borrowing.</p>
               <!--~ In October 2018 WBG shareholders approved increases of $60,100m. in IBRD’scallable capital and of $5,500m. in the paid-in capital of the IFC. - Verify-->
               <p id="IO-UN.1911">IBRD loans usually have a `grace period' of five years and are repayable over 15 years or fewer. Loans are made to governments, or must be guaranteed by the government concerned, and are normally made for projects likely to offer a commercially viable rate of return. In 1980 the World Bank introduced structural adjustment lending, which (instead of financing specific projects) supports programmes and changes necessary to modify the structure of an economy so that it can restore or maintain its growth and viability in its balance of payments over the medium term.</p>
               <p>IBRD made new lending and investment commitments totalling US&#8201;$38,572m. during the financial year ending 30 June 2023 (compared with $33,072m. in the previous year). Of the 136 new operations supported in 2022-23, six were IBRD-IDA blended initiatives. Total disbursements by IBRD in the year ending 30 June 2023 amounted to $25,465m. Total WBG (i.e. combined IBRD, IDA, IFC, MIGA and recipient-executed disbursing account) commitments in 2022/23 amounted to $128,341m., and disbursements to $91,391m.</p>

        The Bank’s Chief Economist leads research, data and analytical activities within the Bank and wider development community. The Development Finance Vice-Presidency manages and monitors policies and procedures relating to the Bank’s development financing mechanisms and supports strategic resource mobilization. The Bank establishes and administers trust funds, open to contributions from member countries and multilateral organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and private sector institutions, in order to support development partnerships. The Bank has consolidated trust funds into a framework of broad `Umbrella 2.0 Programs’, aligned with its priorities. In July 2015 the Third International Conference on Financing for Development (FfD3), convened in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, approved an Action Agenda in which governments expressed their commitment to strengthen the framework to finance sustainable development activities; to follow up the Agenda, an Inter-Agency Task Force on Financing for Development—with participation by more than 60 UN and other entities—was subsequently established by the UN Secretary-General. In March 2023 the WBG President reported that developing countries would collectively require some US&#8201;$2,400,000m. annually until 2030 to address ongoing challenges, and that therefore the Bank’s delivery of Private Capital Facilitation was to be strengthened. The Bank, with nine other multilateral development banks, participated in the Summit for a New Global Financing Pact that was hosted by the French Government, in that country’s capital, Paris, in June 2023. In December the UN General Assembly determined to convene FfD4 during 2025. The 2024 edition of the Bank’s annual

In January 2023 the Bank reported that small states (at the frontline of the climate emergency, despite being small-scale emitters of carbon) frequently suffer disaster-related losses equivalent to roughly 5% of GDP. Meeting in October, the SSF welcomed the Bank’s new Crisis Preparedness and Response Toolkit (see

In February 2022 a 12-member UN High Level Panel of the Multidimensional Vulnerability Index (MVI) initiated work on finalizing the proposed index, which was to be used by international financial institutions to incorporate the specific characteristics of small island states in assessing their vulnerability and eligibility for concessional funding. The MVI was expected to be adopted by the 4th International Conference on Small Island Developing States, to be held in May 2024, in Antigua and Barbuda.

Connectivity was reported to be most costly in Africa. The importance was emphasized of digital public infrastructure (i.e. digital platforms for data sharing, identity and payments) and of innovations in artificial intelligence.

In May 2022, in response to the wider global impacts of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the World Bank, IMF and other international financial institutions collectively issued the Joint International Financial Institution Plan to Address Food Insecurity, with a focus on the following six objectives: (i) support vulnerable people; (ii) promote open trade; (iii) mitigate fertilizer shortages; (iv) support food production now; (v) invest in climate-resilient agriculture for the future; and (vi) co-ordinate for maximum impact. At a meeting of G7 ministers responsible for development held in that month a joint G7-World Bank Global Alliance for Food Security was created, with the aim of promptly catalyzing a concerted response to the global hunger crisis. Other international partners were invited to participate. The Alliance subsequently developed a Global Food and Nutrition Security Dashboard.

               <heading>HIPC Initiative</heading>
               <p>A joint World Bank/IMF initiative to assist heavily indebted poor countries (HIPCs) to reduce their debt burden to a sustainable level, in order to make more resources available for poverty reduction and economic growth, was established in 1996. An enhanced HIPC scheme was approved in September 1999, incorporating the requirement for applicant countries to formulate, in consultation with external partners and other stakeholders, a results-oriented national strategy to promote growth and reduce poverty, to be presented in the form of a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). At a pivotal `decision point' of the process, having developed and successfully applied, for at least one year, a PRSP, applicant countries still deemed to have an unsustainable level of debt qualified for interim debt relief from the IDA and IMF, as well as relief on highly concessional terms from other official bilateral creditors and multilateral institutions. During the ensuing `interim period' countries were required successfully to implement further economic and social development reforms, as a final demonstration of suitability for securing full debt relief at the `completion point' of the scheme. In the majority of cases a sustainable level of debt was targeted at 150% of the net present value (NPV) of the debt in relation to total annual exports. Other countries with lower debt-to-export ratios were to be eligible for assistance under the scheme, providing that their export earnings were at least 30% of gross domestic product (GDP), and government revenue at least 15% of GDP. In 2001 the Bank introduced a Poverty Reduction Support Credit to help low-income countries to implement the policy and institutional reforms outlined in their PRSP. In September 2005 the Bank’s Development Committee and the International Monetary and Financial Committee of the IMF endorsed a G8 proposal—subsequently referred to as the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI)—to provide additional resources to achieve the cancellation of debts owed by eligible HIPCs; countries that had reached their completion point qualified for immediate assistance.</p>
