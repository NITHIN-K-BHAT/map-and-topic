        The ICC has developed rules and guidelines relating to electronic transactions, including guidelines for data protection and for ethical advertising on the internet. It has devised a system of standard trade definitions most commonly used in international sales contracts (international commercial terms—`Incoterms'); an updated set—Incoterms 2020—took effect on 1 January 2020. The ICC’s Model International Sale Contract (revised version: 2020) enables businesses and lawyers to establish import-export agreements that are compatible with Incoterms 2020. The ICC also provides a Model Confidentiality Agreement (revised in 2016), a series of model online business-to-consumer conditions of sale (published in August 2020), and model contracts for, 
        <i>inter alia,</i>
         transfer of technology, commercial agency, international franchising, and mergers and acquisitions. There are also ICC voluntary codes for eliminating extortion and bribery, and for promoting sound environmental management practices. A Consolidated ICC Code of Advertising and Marketing Communications was launched in September 2011, detailing standards for marketers selling over the internet, and aimed also at strengthening protection for online consumers.

               <p>An ICC Centre for Entrepreneurship initiative, launched in February 2020, aimed to provide expert advice to entrepreneurs at local level and link them to global markets. A global network of regional Centres (14 by 2024) operates within the framework of the initiative.</p>

               <p>The ICC provides a framework for settling international commercial disputes. The Commission on Arbitration and ADR acts as a forum for experts to consider current practice and developments in international dispute resolution, and helps to formulate and update ICC rules (e.g. on arbitration or mediation). </p>
               <p>The ICC International Court of Arbitration, which was established in 1923, undertakes to facilitate and administer ICC arbitrations. An ICC Emergency Arbitrator Provisions procedure, which provides for urgent interim or conservatory measures, was introduced in 2012. By 2024 the Court had subsidiary case management offices in New York, USA; São Paulo, Brazil; Hong Kong; Singapore; and in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. The Court’s 28,000th case was registered in September 2023. In October 2022 the Court initiated a first-phase digital case management platform (ICC Case Connect). The development of an advanced case management system, in partnership with the legal technology specialist Opus 2, was undertaken in 2023. Four ICC Advanced Arbitration Academies—covering Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America and North America—were initiated in May 2023; two further academies, for Africa and the Middle East, were to be launched in 2024. </p>
               <p>Other ICC mechanisms for dispute resolution include the ICC International Centre for ADR, and the International Centre for Expertise, which issues the ICC Rules of Expertise, and considers applications received under the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)’s ongoing expanded generic TLDs (gTLDs) programme. The ICC International Centre for ADR administers the Documentary Instruments Dispute Resolution Expertise (DOCDEX) procedure, designed specifically for disputes regarding trade finance-related instruments. Updated ICC Rules of Mediation entered into effect on 1 January 2014. A Young Arbitrators Forum, with participation by arbitrators under 40 years of age, had more than 37,000 professional members in 2024, and aimed to provide knowledge and skills development opportunities. In January 2023, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the ICC Court, an ICC Centenary Declaration on Dispute Prevention and Resolution was released; this included a focus on the further development of global dispute resolution services and tools.</p>
               <p>In February 2018 an ICC Belt and Road Commission was established, to promote the application of the ICC’s existing dispute resolution procedures in relation to the People’s Republic of China’s Belt and Road Initiative, which was launched in 2013 with the aim of developing infrastructure and trade along traditional routes between Asia, Europe and Africa. The mandate of the ICC’s 18-member Africa Commission was expanded during 2021-24 to include North Africa.</p>

ICC recommendations must be adopted by a Commission following consultation with National Committees, and then approved by the ICC World Council or Exec­utive Board, before they can be regarded as official ICC policies. Task Forces are frequently constituted by Commissions to undertake specific projects and report back to their parent body.

          The Global Banking Commission—the ICC’s largest policy commission—supports the global banking industry by providing assistance to policymakers (including on means of stimulating trade finance), compiling relevant publications and market intelligence, extending guidance to support anti-money laundering and compliance activities, providing comprehensive data to inform regulators and advance understanding of risk, and drafting universal rules and guidelines. The latter include the Uniform Customs and Practice (UCP) for Documentary Credits (revised in 2007—the `UCP 600’ edition), which is used by banks to finance international trade; the ICC Uniform Rules for Demand Guarantees (URDG); the New Uniform Rules for Forfeiting (URF), which entered into force (as the `URF 800’ edition) on 1 January 2013, and were endorsed in July 2017 by the UN; and the March 2013 Uniform Rules for Bank Payment Obligations, which set a standard worldwide in supply chain finance. In December 2012 a Banking Commission Advisory Board and Executive Committee were inaugurated to provide strategic direction for the Commission in meeting increasing demands for policy and regulatory support, and for greater transparency and standardization in relation to trade finance products. An ICC Global Export Finance Committee was established in September 2015, under the auspices of the Global Banking Commission, with representation by medium- and long-term export finance banks. The Global Banking Commission compiles the ICC Trade Register, which provides data on default and credit risks in global trade, export and supply chain finance. An annual 
          <publ-name>ICC Trade Register Report</publ-name>
           is compiled; the 2023 edition, issued in November, was accompanied by an online ICC Trade Register Dashboard, and addressed the credit risk performance of trade finance in the context of the lasting impacts on the global economy of the COVID-19 pandemic. In January 2017 the Banking Commission, jointly with the Bankers Association for Finance and Trade (BAFT) and the Wolfsberg Group (comprising 12 global banks that have since 2000 co-operated in developing standards, including in the areas of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing), issued the Wolfsberg Group, ICC and BAFT Trade Finance Principles. It was envisaged that these would help standardize practice in financial crimes compliance for trade transactions. An updated edition of the Global Banking Commission’s Standard Definitions for Techniques of Supply Chain Finance was issued in March 2017.

           (WTO), the World Intellectual Property Organization, the EU and many other intergovernmental bodies, and actively represents the business sector at global forums such as the conferences of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The ICC presidency meets annually with the leader of the country hosting the Group of Seven (G7) summit to discuss business aspects of the meeting. A Group of 20 (G20) Advisory Group, comprising chief executives from major global corporations and other business leaders, aims to support the effective targeting of G20 policy development. In June 2012 the ICC initiated a G20 Business Scorecard, with the aim of evaluating the G20’s performance in response to business recommendations in the areas of financing for growth and development; green growth; trade and investment; and transparency and anti-corruption.

In May 2019 the ICC supported the establishment of a new Singapore-based Centre of Future Trade, which was to promote the transition by commercial enterprises to digital blockchain technology. The ICC Digital Standards Initiative (DSI), launched in March 2020, aimed to promote a harmonized digitized global trade environment. In March 2023 it co-launched a new Global Trade Modernization Index; an updated version was released in March 2024. ICC Uniform Rules for Digital Trade Transactions (URDTT) were issued in October 2021. In February 2022 the ICC and partners—including the

          The ICC prioritizes the management of IP assets and the role of IP in commercial strategies, including in relation to research and innovation in areas such as technology, design, creative content and brands. The following innovation principles are recognized by the ICC as a basis for creating and nurturing innovation ecosystems: Build investor confidence in a trustworthy business environment; Promote education and training for a robust innovation ecosystem; Encourage open trade and investment; and Ensure that IP systems incentivize both innovation and dissemination. In 2011 a set of updated

           was published by BASCAP. The ICC regularly issues an updated 
          <i>Intellectual Property Roadmap,</i>
           addressing patents, trademarks, copyright, and other IP rights. The 14th edition, released in November 2020, had a focus on measures to protect businesses from counterfeiting and piracy; the implications for IP rights and business strategies of developments in artificial intelligence; and IP as a catalyst for sustainable development.

          , that provided—in response to recent retaliatory increases in trade tariffs imposed by major economies (including the USA and People’s Republic of China)—an evidence-based assessment for global policymakers of the potential related economic and social impacts of a return to 1930s-style broad-based tariff increases. The report made the following three recommendations for policymakers: openness about the negative effects that trade liberalization has had on certain groups, while emphasizing the inadequacy of tariff hikes as a solution; insisting on a deliberative process and on reference to data-driven societal impact assessments in advance of all proposed major tariff increases; and using more effective tools—such as multilateral forums and the pursuit of more flexible trade agreements that do not pursue free trade at all costs—as a means of resolving grievances.

In this framework it issued guidance to businesses on establishing continuity plans, recommended to governments a set of proposed tax measures aimed at supporting SMEs, and urged governments and customs authorities to introduce new measures tailored to assisting business continuity. An ICC COVID-19 web portal was initiated in April, presenting continuously updated information for chambers of commerce, policymakers and businesses. In January 2021 the ICC Chairperson reported on research that demonstrated the high level of risk posed to global economic recovery by unequal access to COVID-19 vaccines.
