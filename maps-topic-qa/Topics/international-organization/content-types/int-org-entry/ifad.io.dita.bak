          <heading>Activities</heading>
          <p>IFAD works to extend financing in support of inclusive rural development and the eradication of rural poverty and hunger. It aims to improve food production systems, to enhance access to agricultural markets and technologies and to strengthen the resilience of rural communities to climate change. IFAD advocates for the world’s rural poor, and in particular for the most marginalized groups in developing countries, including small-scale farmers, artisanal fishermen, nomadic pastoralists, rural women, and the landless.</p>
          <p>
      IFAD's Strategic Framework for 2016-25 was devised within the context of the UN’s 
      <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-UNDP.001">2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development</xr>
      , with its associated set of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Priority areas of the Strategic Framework include the need to maximize IFAD’s strategic positioning, to use its comparative advantage in both a leadership and catalytic role; to forge partnerships with governments, rural communities, farmers’ organizations, and other stakeholders; to mobilize increased investment for smallholder agriculture; to improve institutional efficiency; to mobilize resources through innovative means; to innovate in all of IFAD’s areas of expertise; to continue to mainstream gender equality and women’s empowerment, climate-smart agriculture and the sustainable management of natural resources, the promotion of nutrition-sensitive agriculture, and the development of inclusive financial services and of public-private production partnerships (that promote equal partner status for smallholder food producers in value chain systems); as well as to continue to advance South-South and triangular co-operation (SSTC).

               <heading>Projects and Programmes</heading>
               <p>IFAD supports rural communities through financing, tools and knowledge, with a focus on specific issues such as climate and the environment, land tenure, water security, and nutrition. It works with rural communities, including women and youth-led organizations, to design inclusive, effective projects, within the framework of a, separately developed, results-based country strategic opportunities programme (COSOP). IFAD supports projects that aim to increase the productive capacity of the poorest communities, to enhance their access to markets, and to strengthen their resilience to the changing climate. IFAD supervises the implementation of the projects it supports and sends monitoring and evaluation missions to all countries of operations. IFAD's development projects usually include several compon­ents, such as infrastructure (e.g. improvement of water supplies, small-scale irrigation and road construction); input supply (e.g. improved animal feed, seeds, fertilizers and pesticides); institutional support (e.g. research, training and extension services); and producer incentives (e.g. pricing and marketing improvements).</p>
               <p>
        The Fund supports projects that are concerned with environmental conservation, in an effort to alleviate poverty that results from the deterioration of natural resources. In September 2021 IFAD issued a 
        <publ-name>Stocktake Report on Agroecology in IFAD Operations: An Integrated Approach to Sustainable Food Systems,</publ-name>
         its first comprehensive assessment of agroecological practices—which combine traditional farming knowledge with modern scientific innovation, and aim to integrate ecological, social and economic development. The report addressed the efficient use and natural management of resources; diversification and agrobiodiversity; recycling of nutrients, water, biomass and energy; and innovations that link producers and consumers. The Fund reported at that time that agroecology was a component of three-fifths of the Fund’s projects.
      </p>
               <p>At the end of 2022 total IFAD loans approved since 1978 amounted to US&#8201;$23,241.3m. for 1,181 projects. IFAD approved $880.9m. in loan financing for a total of 14 new projects in 2022 (compared with $1,030.8m. for 27 projects in the previous year). In order to increase the impact of its lending resources on food production, the Fund seeks as much as possible to attract other external donors and beneficiary governments as co­financiers of its projects. In 2022 external co-financing amounted to $559.3m., while domestic contributions, i.e. from recipient governments and other local sources, totalled $452.7m.</p>
               <p usage="sasia fea">During 2022 IFAD approved lending for four new operations in Asia and the Pacific, in Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia and Lao People’s Democratic Republic.

By 31 December 2022 IFAD had provided US&#8201;$253.3m. in debt relief to the countries eligible for assistance under the initiative. In September 2010, the Executive Board approved the establishment of a Spanish Food Security Cofinancing Facility Trust Fund (the `Spanish Trust Fund'), which is used to provide loans to IFAD borrower nations. </p>

        IFAD convenes and has institutionalized various meetings at regional and international level to stimulate dialogue and to promote effective partnerships. In September 2021 IFAD, with the 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-UN.1742">Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO)</xr>
        , the 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="SL607803">World Food Programme (WFP)</xr>
         and the UN Secretary-General, organized a Food Systems Summit (FSS), with the aim of raising global awareness of challenges related to the production, processing and consumption of food, and to improving the output of safe, nutritious food. In January 2022, to support the follow-up to the FSS, a co-ordination hub was launched, under the joint leadership of IFAD, FAO and WFP, and assisted by a Champions Advisory Group comprising stakeholder representation by, 
        <i>inter alia,</i>
         producers, the private sector, Indigenous peoples, youth and women.
      </p>
               <p>The seventh meeting of IFAD’s Farmers' Forum (established in 2005, to promote dialogue between smallholders and rural producers’ associations) was convened in February 2020. Global Forums are convened every four years, with regional events and consultations held in the intervening period. IFAD supported farmers’ organizations to hold dialogues on the sidelines of the 2021 FFS. IFAD, with the International Labour Organization, was to lead a new coalition for action, established by the FSS, concerned with decent work and living incomes and wages for all food systems workers.</p>
               <p>Since 2009 IFAD has had a formal policy of engagement with Indigenous communities. Subsequently an Indigenous People’s Forum has been convened every two years, preceded by a series of regional workshops and consultations. The sixth global Forum was held in February 2023.</p>
               <p>
        A Global Forum on Remittances, Investment and Development has been convened every two years since 2007 to bring together stakeholders in the remittance and migration systems. In mid-June 2023 IFAD helped host the latest edition of the Forum (GFRID 2023), in Nairobi, Kenya. In 2022 an estimated 200,000 migrant workers transferred US $626,000m. back to family members in low- and middle-income countries (many in rural areas), supporting, 
        <i>inter alia,</i>
         local education, health and housing requirements. IFAD co-ordinates observance of an annual International Day of Family Remittances (on 16 June).

        IFAD works with private sector and producer organizations, foundations, academic and research institutions, multilateral finance institutions and other organizations and governments to strengthen its impact and accelerate its objectives. IFAD is a longstanding co-sponsor of the 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-UN.1932">Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research</xr>
        . Within the UN, IFAD works closely with 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-UN.1742">FAO</xr>
         and 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="SL607803">WFP</xr>
        , all of which share the mandate of achieving SDG 2 (End hunger), and provide financial and technical support to the UN’s Committee on World Food Security. The three agencies contribute to an 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-FAO.AMIS.1">Agricultural Market Information System (AMIS)</xr>
        , which aims to increase market transparency and to address the stabilization of food price volatility, and with UNICEF and the World Health Organization, compile the annual 
        <publ-name>State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World</publ-name>
         report. In May 2022, in the context of the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine, IFAD, the IMF, 
        
        the World Bank and other international financial institutions collectively issued the Joint International Financial Institution Plan to Address Food Insecurity, with a focus on the following six objectives: (i) support vulnerable people; (ii) promote open trade; (iii) mitigate fertilizer shortages; (iv) support food production now; (v) invest in climate-resilient agriculture for the future; and (vi) co-ordinate for maximum impact.

               <p>IFAD participates in the Steering Committee of UN-Nutrition, which was initiated in 2020 to co-ordinate UN agencies in advancing nutrition and eliminating hunger, malnutrition and obesity.</p>
               <p>
        IFAD is an executing agency of the 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="UNEP.IO.001">Green Climate Fund</xr>
        , and of the 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-UN.1344">Global Environmental Facility</xr>
         (GEF, which specializes in combating rural poverty and environmental degradation). From November 2022 IFAD and FAO assumed joint leadership of the GEF’s new Food Systems Integrated Program: this aimed to channel some US&#8201;$230m. (to be amplified by co-financing) in grants towards projects focused on sustainably transforming agrifood systems.
