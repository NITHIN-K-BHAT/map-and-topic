          <p id="IO-UN.1967">IFC was founded in 1956 to stimulate economic growth in developing countries through the direct financing of private sector investments. IFC also mobilizes capital in international financial markets, and provides technical assistance and advice to governments and businesses. It is an integral member of the World Bank Group (WBG), although it has its own specialized agency status. From 2013 IFC participated in the first WBG Strategy aimed at reducing extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity by 2030.</p>

          <p>IFC aims to advance the economies of developing member countries by lending directly to sustainable private enterprises without the need for government guarantees, and by providing expert advisory services. IFC finances private sector projects either through loans from its own account (known as A-loans); through equity and quasi-equity financing and syndicated loans (B-loans); or through partial credit guarantees and risk management products. IFC also extends funding to financial intermediaries, which then lend onwards to clients. It aims to facilitate the conditions that stimulate the flow of domestic and foreign private investment and generate jobs. IFC may provide finance for a project that is partly state-owned, provided that there is participation by the private sector and that the project is operated on a commercial basis. IFC also mobilizes additional resources from other financial institutions, in particular through syndicated loans, thus providing access to international capital markets. Its range of advisory services aim to improve the investment climate in developing countries. Technical assistance is extended to private enterprises and governments.</p>
          <p id="IO-UN.1981">To be eligible for financing, projects must be profitable for investors, as well as financially and economically viable; must benefit the economy of the country concerned; and must comply with IFC's environmental and social guidelines. IFC aims to promote best corporate governance and management methods and sustainable business practices, and encourages partnerships between governments, non-governmental organizations and community groups. The longer-term economic, environmental and social impact of projects are assessed in accordance with the IFC’s Sustainability Framework. An Anticipated Impact Measurement and Monitoring (AIMM) system that was introduced in 2017 is integrated into all IFC operations.</p>
          <p usage="ewyb edio">IFC mobilizes funds through a loan syndications programme, which in 2022/23 generated US&#8201;$5,492m.</p>
          <p>IFC's authorized share capital is US&#160;$2,580m. In July 2010 the Board of Directors recommended a special capital increase of $130m., to raise the authorized capital from $2,450m.; the increase took effect on 27 June 2012, having received the approval of the Board of Governors. A capital increase endorsed by the Board of Governors in October 2018 provided for the conversion of a portion of retained earnings into paid-in capital, and a Selective Capital Increase (SCI) and a General Capital Increase (GCI) that would provide up to $5,500m. in additional paid-in capital; the suspension of IFC grants to the International Development Agency (IDA) after the conclusion of the IDA18 replenishment cycle; and internal reform measures aimed at ensuring increased efficiency. The GCI and SCI took effect on 16 April 2020, followed on 22 April by the initiation of a subscription process. At 30 June 2023 IFC’s paid-in capital stood at $22,596m. The World Bank was originally the principal source of borrowed funds, but IFC also borrows from private capital markets. In 2022/23 IFC reported a net income of $672m.</p>
          <p>An IFC 3.0 Strategy, implemented from 2018, aimed to identify market opportunities, generate markets, and boost investment from private sector sources, with a particular focus on designing profitable initiatives with strong development impacts in regions with high rates of poverty and fragility. In April 2019 IFC adopted a series of Operating Principles for Impact Management, which aimed to promote transparency in investments.</p>
          <p>By 30 June 2023, since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, IFC had committed US&#8201;$8,400m. through a dedicated Fast Track COVID-19 Facility, and an additional $17,000m. in other forms of pandemic response. Some $4,100m. was committed through the Facility during 2022/23.</p>
          <p>IFC’s Global Trade Finance Program (GTFP), founded in 2004, provides guarantees for trade transactions. By March 2024 more than 225 eligible financial institutions in 69 countries were participating in the GTFP. The Banking on Women Global Trade Finance Programme (BOW-GTFP) supports banks participating in the GTFP network to expand trade finance to women-owned SMEs (`WSMEs’).</p>

In 2022/23 IFC issued 20 green bonds (raising $2,000m.) and 15 social bonds (raising $1,200m.). Proceeds from IFC green bonds have been invested in sustainable climate-smart initiatives, and proceeds from social bonds are invested in projects that foster social, economic and gender equality in emerging markets.</p>
