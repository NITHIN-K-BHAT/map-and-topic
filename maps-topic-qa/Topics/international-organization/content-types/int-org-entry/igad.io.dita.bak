          <p id="IGAD.IO.434">IGAD was estab­lished in 1996 to supersede the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development (IGADD, which, in turn had been founded in 1986 to combat the effects of aridity and desertification arising from the severe drought and famine that has periodically affected the Horn of Africa). IGAD aims to co-ordinate the sustainable socioeconomic co-operation and development of member countries, to strengthen food security and environmental protection, to combat the effects of drought and desertification, and to promote regional security.</p>

          <p>A strategy to guide IGAD’s activities during 2021-25 focused on the following pillars: (i) agriculture, natural resources and environment; (ii) economic co-operation; (iii) health and social development; (iv) peace and security, and humanitarian affairs; and (v) corporate development services. Emphasis was to be placed on: Response to crises; Revitalization of regional integration; Reform to enhance organizational efficiency; and Results.

               <heading>Economic Co-operation</heading>
               <p>In September 2022 an IGAD Regional Trade Policy was launched, covering the period 2022-26, with the following objectives: creating an open, unified regional economic space, to boost intra-IGAD trade in goods and services; fostering coherence between member states’ trade policies; supporting the implementation by member states of their obligations with respect to the African Continental Free Trade Area agreement and other regional trade arrangements; and promoting an enabling environment for investment (external and domestic). IGAD prioritizes regional value chain development.</p>
               <p>IGAD supports the development of the regional infrastructure, particu­larly in the areas of transport and communications, to promote foreign, cross-border and domestic trade and investment opportunities. IGAD seeks to harmonize national transport and trade policy and thereby to facilitate the free movement of people, goods and services. In April 2019 IGAD’s Executive Secretary signed a contract enabling the development of an IGAD Regional Infrastructure Master Plan (IRIMP). To be pursued until 2050, this was to cover clean energy, transport, information technologies, and transboundary water resources. A roundtable conference to support implementation of the IRIMP was held in Nairobi, Kenya, in November 2021.</p>
               <p>Infrastructure projects under way in the region include the construction of missing segments of the Trans-African Highway and the Pan African Telecommunications Network; the removal of barriers to trade and communications; improvements to ports and inland container terminals; and the modernization of railway and telecommunications services. IGAD has promoted the upgrading of the Djibouti-Addis Ababa (Ethiopia)-Juba (South Sudan)-Kampala (Uganda) transport corridor. An IGAD Business Forum was organized in mid-2021, in Addis Ababa. An Eastern Africa Regional Digital Integration Project was initiated in mid-2023.</p>
               <p>A Protocol on Free Movement of Persons in the IGAD Region was endorsed by ministers responsible for internal affairs and labour in February 2020. The second IGAD Ministerial Conference on Labour, Employment and Labour Migration was convened in March 2023, in Addis Ababa. In August IGAD organized a consultation meeting to address the establishment of a regionwide single visa system. In May 2021 IGAD and the UN Capital Development Fund agreed to co-operate to harmonize policy across the IGAD member states on remittances (i.e. cross-border payments made by diaspora migrants working outside their country of origin).</p>

               <heading>Agriculture and Environment</heading>
               <p>IGAD’s Agriculture and Environment Division focuses on natural resources management, renewable energy, agriculture and food security, land governance and blue economy, and sustainable environment protection.</p>
               <p>About 80% of the IGAD region is classified as arid or semi-arid, and some 40% of the region is unproductive. Meanwhile, seasonal flooding has intensified in recent years. An IGAD Food Security and Nutrition Response Strategy, launched in August 2020, aimed to support vulnerable populations through enhancing the regional co-ordinated response capacity to withstand multiple concurrent shocks (outbreaks of diseases, desert locust infestations, and climatic disasters); extending targeted humanitarian and livelihood assistance; improving longer-term nutrition security; and enhancing regional trade and market access. </p>
               <p>In June 2021 an IGAD Ministerial Conference on the Sustainable Management of Desert Locusts and other Transboundary Pests—with participation by the ministers of agriculture from member states and Yemen—endorsed a regional roadmap on the control of transboundary pests and established an Inter-regional Pests Early Warning System, to facilitate the prompt exchange between countries in the Horn of Africa and the Arabian peninsula on the emergence of desert locusts and other pests.</p>
               <p>In November 2011 IGAD and partner countries agreed the institutional arrangements for implementing a Horn of Africa IGAD Drought Disaster Resilience and Sustainability Initiative (IDDRSI): Ending Drought Emergencies, which had been launched in September. The meeting also agreed to establish an IDDRSI Platform, intended as an enhanced partnership with donors facilitating long-term investment to end the recurrence of drought emergencies. A Platform Steering Committee was constituted in February 2013. The Initiative aims to achieve drought-resistant communities, institutions and ecosystems in the IGAD region by 2027. In December 2016 IGAD heads of state and of government authorized the establishment of a multi-donor trust fund, under the management of the IDDRSI Platform. In January 2017, within the IDDRSI framework, a European Union (EU)-funded Collaboration in Cross-Border Areas of the Horn of Africa Region project was initiated. A new IDDRSI strategy to cover the period 2019-24 identified the following priority intervention areas: Natural resources and environmental management; Market access, trade and financial services; Enhanced production and livelihoods diversification; Disaster risk management; Research, knowledge management and technology transfer; Peacebuilding, conflict prevention and resolution; Co-ordination, institutional strengthening and partnerships; and Human capital, gender and social development. The eighth IDDRSI Platform General Assembly, convened in July 2022, in Addis Ababa, noted that the region was suffering the most extreme drought for four decades, had also been affected by severe flooding since 2019, and was vulnerable to compounding factors such as ongoing global political and economic instability. The Assembly meeting appealed to humanitarian actors to extend the necessary resources to address persisting food insecurity in the region; called on the IGAD Secretariat, member states and development partners to intensify regional, climate-smart resilience investments; asked Platform members to support the effective regulation of cross-border pastoralist mobility (to prevent conflict); and urged the strengthening of anticipatory early action.</p>
               <p>Ministers responsible for biodiversity, environment and natural resources adopted an IGAD Regional Biodiversity Protocol in July 2017, as well as related strategies addressing conservation of transboundary wildlife and sharing of biodiversity benefits, control and management of invasive species, and the national application of relevant regional, continental and global legislation. A Horn of Africa Wildlife Enforcement Network, established in November of that year as the regional anti-wildlife trafficking framework, is managed by the IGAD Secretariat.</p>
               <p>In October 2015 the IGAD Center for Pastoral Areas and Livestock Development established a Regional Export Quarantines Network. In December IGAD and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (UN) jointly initiated a regional project `Improving Supply of Safe and Quality Livestock and Meat Exported from the Horn of Africa to Middle East and Gulf Countries’. An IGAD regional Livestock Identification and Traceability Systems legal framework was initiated in May 2016. In August an IGAD Regional Animal Welfare Strategy and accompanying action plan were validated.</p>
               <p>
        An IGAD Land Policy Initiative (IGAD LPI), being implemented in the context of the 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="AU.IO">African Union (AU)</xr>
         2009 Land Declaration on Land Issues and Challenges in Africa, focuses on, 
        <i>inter alia,</i>
         land and natural resources degradation; land tenure insecurity; the disproportionately weak land rights of youth, women, pastoralists and other vulnerable groups; land governance and migration; land and conflict; and food insecurity. An IGAD High-Level Regional Conference on Land and Conflict in the East and Horn of Africa was organized in October 2022, in Kampala, to address collectively placing land use and management at the core of food security and climate change response initiatives, and as a cornerstone of building peace and security in the region. The Conference was followed by a meeting of IGAD ministers responsible for lands, justice and environment, which endorsed a 10-year IGAD Agenda for Action on land use transformation and conflict management. An IGAD workshop aimed at improving land governance in the region was organized in December. (By that time the only IGAD member states to have established national land commissions were Kenya, South Sudan, Sudan and Uganda.)
      </p>
               <p>An IGAD Regional Forestry Policy and Strategy was adopted by ministers responsible for forestry in March 2020.</p>
               <p>IGAD has placed a focus on developing the contribution of fish resources in arid and semi-arid areas to strengthening local food security and the diversification of livelihoods. An IGAD regional fisheries and aquaculture strategy and action plan were approved in March 2016. The inaugural meeting of an IGAD Fisheries Coordination Platform was convened in September 2021. The second meeting of the Platform, held in August 2022, evaluated the progress in member states of the EU-funded E€OFISH Programme (aimed at developing the sustainable and integrated management of inland and marine fisheries resources in eastern and southern Africa, and the western Indian Ocean, during the period September 2018-September 2024). The Strengthening Trans-Boundary Water Governance and Cooperation in the IGAD Region programme, initiated in December 2016, aimed to enhance regional and local level frameworks for collaboration and dispute mitigation. In January 2022 the second IGAD Water Dialogue Forum was convened, in Entebbe, Uganda, on the theme `Groundwater for resilience’. In December IGAD launched a six-year World Bank-supported Groundwater for Resilience Project, focused on strengthening the sustainable management and use of groundwater in the Horn of Africa; an Information System and a Regional Platform for Groundwater Collaboration were to be established under the initiative.</p>
               <p>In October 2021 a three-year IGAD Blue Economy Project was launched, with a focus on enhancing Blue Economy governance; compiling an inventory of plastic and chemical sea pollutants; developing measures to alleviate the impacts of these on aquatic biodiversity and ecosystems; and undertaking marine biodiversity situation analyses. An IGAD Blue Economy Strategy (2021-25) was initiated in April 2022; member states subsequently developed aligned national strategies. The inaugural meeting of an IGAD Blue Economy Steering Committee was held in November, in Juba.</p>
               <p usage="ass">In late 2022 IGAD organized workshops that addressed the sustainable socioeconomic development of two transboundary fishing regions: the Baro-Akobo-Sobat River Basin (shared by Ethiopia and South Sudan), and the Lake Turkana Basin (Ethiopia/Kenya).</p>
               <p>Other activities to improve food security and preserve natural resources have included the introduction of remote-sensing services; the development of a Livestock Marketing Information System and of a Regional Inte­grated Information System; the establishment of training and credit schemes for fishers; research into the sustainable pro­duction of drought-resistant, high-yielding crop varieties; livestock vaccine production; the control of environmental pollution; the pro­motion of alternative sources of energy in the home; the promotion of community-based land husbandry; training programmes in grain marketing; and the implementation of the International Convention to Combat Desertification. The inaugural meeting of an IGAD Seed Policy Dialogue Forum, convened in August 2022, in Addis Ababa, recommended the operationalization of a regional seed dialogue platform. A particular focus was to be placed on advancing the use in member states of climate-resilient seeds. In October an IGAD ministerial meeting was convened to consider means of strengthening, adapting, and accelerating national and regional efforts to address food crises in East Africa. An IGAD Learning Network on Nutrition Surveillance (LeNNS) was launched in November. In June 2023 IGAD ministers responsible for agriculture validated a new Regional Food Safety Strategy.</p>

               <p>IGAD addresses cross-border health, digital health and disease surveillance. In early 2020 the IGAD Executive Secretary established an IGAD Taskforce on COVID-19. In July the 36th extraordinary meeting of IGAD heads of state and government called for the adoption of regional guidelines on the harmonization and facilitation of cross-border transport operations, and welcomed the establishment of a new IGAD Emergency Fund (for the control of pandemic diseases). In December IGAD heads of state and government urged the international community to facilitate the timely and equitable distribution of safe and affordable COVID-19 vaccines. An inaugural IGAD Scientific Virtual Conference on Pharmaceutical Manufacturing was held in November 2021, at which means of developing a regional pharmaceutical production capacity were explored. In November 2022 IGAD’s Council of Ministers reported that, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the organization’s Executive Secretariat had facilitated the delivery to member states of 36 medical support vehicles, 8.6m. sets of personal protective equipment, and 14 polymerase chain reaction testing machines. At that time the Council of Ministers committed to supporting the Ugandan authorities in curbing an ongoing outbreak in that country of Ebola Virus Disease; confirmation in January 2023 that the outbreak had been contained was welcomed by the Executive Secretary. The establishment of an IGAD Centre for Health Emergency Preparedness and Response, to be hosted by Sudan, was pending in 2024.</p>
               <p>In May 2020 IGAD initiated a Regional Education Policy Framework, supporting the expansion of accessible, inclusive, high-quality education throughout the member states. The inaugural consultative meeting of a Board of IGAD Council of Higher Education was convened in July 2021. In December 2017 IGAD ministers responsible for education adopted the Djibouti Declaration on ensuring access to quality education for refugees. An IGAD scholarship programme for refugee students was intiated in December 2021 and took effect in 2023. In June 2022 the Health and Social Development Division organized a Regional Teacher Training Learning Exchange Workshop for Displaced and Refugee Communities.</p>
               <p>In December 2009 the first IGAD Women's Parliamentary Conference, convened in Addis Ababa, adopted a declaration on the Enhancement of Women’s Participation and Representation in Decision-Making Positions. An IGAD Women and Peace Forum Board was inaugurated in October 2015. In March 2020 IGAD’s Executive Secretary noted the need to redress persisting gender inequalities relating to women’s education and health outcomes, as well as asset ownership. In September 2023 an IGAD Institutional Capacity Building Programme for Gender Equality and Women Empowerment was launched. Also in that month the 1st Conference of IGAD Ministers in Charge of Youth was convened; this adopted an IGAD Youth Policy Framework.</p>

        An IGAD Regional Secretariat on Forced Displacement and Mixed Migration manages the Development Response to Displacement Impacts Project (DRDIP), which was launched in 2016, to bring about improvements in the living conditions of and opportunities available to displaced people. In March 2019 IGAD’s member states issued the Kampala Declaration on achieving durable solutions for refugees, returnees, and local host communities. An IGAD support platform was established in December to co-ordinate assistance to and long-term solutions for refugees in the region. In mid-2020 IGAD launched consultations with member states on harmonizing the regional collection and use of data on migration. The inaugural

The conference appointed a transitional Somali legislature, which then elected a transitional national president. The IGAD summit meeting, held in Khartoum, Sudan, in November, welcomed the conclusion in September of an agreement on reconciliation between the new Somali transitional administration and a prominent opposition alliance, and appointed a special envoy to implement IGAD's directives concerning the Somali situation. The second Somalia reconciliation conference was initiated in October 2002, in Eldoret, Kenya, and relocated to Nairobi in February 2003. In January 2004 the Nairobi conference determined to establish a new parliament; this was inaugurated in August. In January 2005 IGAD heads of state and of government authorized the deployment of a Peace Support Mission to Somalia (IGASOM) to assist the transitional federal authorities there, pending the subsequent deployment of an AU peace force; in January 2007, however, the AU Peace and Security Council authorized the deployment of the AU Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) in place of the proposed IGASOM. An IGAD Facilitator for Somalia Peace and Reconciliation was appointed in December 2008. The Kampala Accord, signed in June 2011 by the President of the Somali transitional federal authorities and the Speaker of the transitional legislature, and related roadmap on its implementation, determined that IGAD and the EAC, with UN and AU co-operation, should establish a political bureau to oversee and advance the Somali peace process. An extraordinary session of the Authority, convened in January 2012, endorsed an IGAD Somalia Inland Strategy and Action Plan to Prevent and Counter Piracy. (IGAD is a member of the International Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia.) In December IGAD adopted a Grand Stabilization Plan for South Central Somalia, under the auspices of the IGAD Facilitator.</p>

This was endorsed by an agreement concluded between the Government and the newly elected Juba authorities in August. In September 2014 IGAD, with help from the UN and the EU, facilitated a reconciliation conference of Jubaland communities that was hosted, in Kismayo, by the Somali authorities. A permanent regional legislature was inaugurated in April 2015; Jubaland presidential elections were conducted in August.</p>

The legislative elections were held in October-November, and a new Somali Federal Parliament was inaugurated in late December. A presidential election was held in February 2017. In March an extraordinary summit, convened in Nairobi to address the large Somali displaced and refugee population throughout the region, adopted the Nairobi Comprehensive Plan of Action for Durable Solutions for Somali Refugees. A new IGAD Special Envoy for Somalia was appointed in June. In October IGAD expressed horror at recent al-Shabaab terror attacks perpetrated in Mogadishu that had resulted in at least 587 fatalities. In December a power-sharing agreement, negotiated under the auspices of IGAD, was signed by the leaders of Somalia’s Galmudug State (which had been created in July 2015) and the Sufi-based paramilitary grouping Ahlu Sunna Wal Jama’a (which has opposed the al-Shabaab insurgency); this was, however, subsequently abandoned. In July 2018 a joint IGAD-UN Assistance Mission in Somalia was dispatched to Garowe, Hargeisa, Puntland and Somaliland, to explore means of achieving a peaceful resolution of an escalation of tension in the Tukaraq area. The IGAD Executive Secretary condemned a major terrorist atrocity committed against targets in Mogadishu in October. In October 2019 he deplored an attack against UN and AU facilities again in the Somali capital.</p>
                    <p>In August 2020 IGAD and other international partners issued a statement that called for the participation of all Somali leaders in pending consultations on developing electoral modalities—in relation to advancing the preparation of legislative and presidential elections that had been postponed from November to February 2021. In February 2021, following the further postponement of the planned elections, IGAD welcomed an agreement reached by the Federal Government of Somalia and Council of Presidential Candidates on a number of issues relating to security, public safety, and to upholding the right of peaceful assembly. Tensions mounted, however, culminating in violent protests following a decision in April to extend President Farmajo’s term in office by two years. In early May IGAD expressed support for the resumption of dialogue, following the parliamentary annulment of the extension, and subsequently commended all parties for the conclusion of a political agreement. In December IGAD organized a capacity building workshop that developed a roadmap for enhancing intergovernmental relations and systems in Somalia’s federal structure. Legislative elections were initiated in Somalia in November. A new Parliament was inaugurated in April 2022, and the electoral process was completed in mid-May following the election and swearing in of a new President, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud. IGAD’s Executive Secretary offered the organization’s full support to the new government, and commended former President Farmajo for facilitating a peaceful transition of power. In December IGAD organized a dialogue on issues relating to forced displacement and local host communities in Somalia.</p>
                    <p>In early January 2024 the IGAD Executive Secretary stated deep concern over rising tensions between Somalia and Ethiopia, following the conclusion by Ethiopia and Somalia’s separatist region of Somaliland, on 1 January, of a controversial accord under which Ethiopia was to be granted maritime access to the Red Sea port of Berbera for 50 years, in return for de facto formal recognition of Somaliland’s regime. At an extraordinary meeting of IGAD heads of state and government, convened in Kampala, Uganda, both countries were urged to embark on a constructive dialogue to reduce tensions; the meeting reaffirmed the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Somalia. In March IGAD’s Executive Secretary condemned an al-Shabaab attack against a hotel in Mogadishu.</p>

In April 2012 IGAD’s Executive Secretary expressed deep concern at escalating conflict between Sudan and South Sudan, and urged the two sides to adhere to a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed in February on non-aggression and co-operation. From 2013 sectarian conflict between forces loyal to the President, Salva Kiir Mayardit, and those supportive of the Vice-President, Riek Machar, undermined the security of South Sudan.</p>
                    <p usage="edio ass">In December 2013 IGAD established a Mediation Process for South Sudan—under the leadership of three newly appointed special envoys to South Sudan— tasked with brokering a ceasefire between government and opposition forces and pursuing a dialogue for inclusive and sustainable peace. An extraordinary summit meeting on South Sudan, held in January 2014, welcomed the signing in that month by the South Sudan authorities and armed militants of a Cessation of Hostilities Agreement (COHA) and of a further accord relating to the status of detainees. The meeting urged the expeditious implementation of the agreements, and, in that respect, directed IGAD’s special envoys to establish an IGAD Monitoring and Verification Mechanism (IGAD MVM) in South Sudan. IGAD leaders met once again in an extraordinary summit in mid-March to assess progress made by the IGAD mediation team in South Sudan. They welcomed the adoption in February by the parties to the conflict in South Sudan of a follow-up `Implementation Modalities’ document, and authorized the prompt deployment of a regional Protection and Deterrent Force as part of the IGAD MVM. (The Force was deployed from June.) IGAD MVM activities commenced in South Sudan at the beginning of April. Priority IGAD monitoring and verification teams—MVTs—were also deployed from April. An extraordinary summit of IGAD heads of state and of government, convened in June, welcomed the conclusion in early May by the South Sudanese President and opposition leadership of an agreement on ending the conflict in South Sudan. In late August an extraordinary summit meeting deplored numerous violations by all parties of agreements signed to date; demanded full co-operation with the MVTs; welcomed the recent conclusion by all parties of the Implementation Matrix to the January COHA; and endorsed arrangements to establish a new negotiation political dispensation for South Sudan, which was to outline a transitional governance agenda, and also arrangements for a transitional government of national unity. (At the end of August the main opposition grouping denied having signed the Implementation Matrix, although this was contested by IGAD, and the special envoys urged all the parties to the conflict to adhere to it.) An IGAD summit meeting held in early November demanded that both the South Sudanese Government and the opposition cease hostilities with immediate effect, and threatened the imposition of collective IGAD sanctions should this not happen. In February 2015 the South Sudanese President and main opposition leader signed a document that recommitted the parties to the conflict to implementing all previously signed accords, with the aim of establishing a transitional government by early July, and reaching an agreement by 5 March on facilitating this process; the IGAD secretariat released a statement in early March, however, regretting that this initial deadline had not been met. In June an expanded negotiating mechanism, IGAD Plus, was agreed upon by the conflicting sides, to comprise, in addition to the special envoys, representatives of the AU, the EU, the UN, the IPF, the People’s Republic of China, and the so-called Troika of Norway, the United Kingdom and the USA. A new compromise peace agreement, based on the protracted negotiations with all stakeholders to the conflict, was issued in July. In August a fourth phase of peace talks, under the IGAD Plus formation, was initiated, resulting in all parties signing a new Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in South Sudan (ARCSS). IGAD MVM was transformed at that time into the Ceasefire and Transitional Security Arrangements Monitoring Mechanism (CTSAMM). In November IGAD appointed chairpersons to lead the CTSAMM and a Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission (JMEC) on the Peace Agreement on South Sudan, also established to oversee the implementation of the accord. In January 2016 IGAD ministers responsible for foreign affairs noted only limited implementation, hitherto, of ARCSS, and urged representation on the JMEC by all relevant South Sudanese political organizations. The Transitional Government of National Unity of South Sudan—with Kiir remaining as President and Machar returning to the administration as First Vice-President (a newly established post)—was appointed at the end April and was to remain in power pending elections to be held in 2018.</p>

                    <p>An extraordinary summit of IGAD leaders was held in July 2016, in Nairobi, to address an escalation of fighting in South Sudan since late April. In the following month an IGAD Plus extraordinary summit issued a communiqué in which it expressed deep concern over the grave conflict-related humanitarian situation and population displacement in South Sudan, and reiterated strong condemnation of the recent outbreak of violent conflict in Juba, as well as the targeting of diplomatic, UN and humanitarian personnel. The summit meeting also endorsed a proposal of East African Chiefs of Defence that a Regional Protection Force should be deployed. Consequently, in mid-August the UN Security Council authorized the deployment of a 4,000-strong Regional Protection Force within the UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), tasked with creating a secure environment in and around Juba, and—in response to extreme circumstances—elsewhere in South Sudan. Having initially rejected the immediate deployment of the Force, the South Sudanese authorities eventually granted consent in September. The 31st extraordinary IGAD summit meeting, held in June 2017, welcomed a national dialogue process that was launched in late May by President Kiir, and urged that this should be inclusive and transparent. A new IGAD Special Envoy for South Sudan was appointed. The inaugural session of a High-Level Revitalization Forum (HLRF) of the parties to the August 2015 Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in South Sudan was convened, in Addis Ababa, in December 2017, attended by representatives of all parties to the conflict, IGAD Plus observers and civil society organizations. A new Agreement on Cessation of Hostilities, Protection of Civilians, and Humanitarian Access was concluded. From early 2018, however, repeated violations of the accord were reported. The second phase of the HLRF on South Sudan, convened in February under the auspices of IGAD, reaffirmed commitment to the December 2017 Agreement. In late January 2018 an extraordinary session of the IGAD Council of Ministers determined that punitive sanctions should be imposed against individuals found to have violated the Agreement, and that violators would also be referred to the AU Peace and Security Council. A further extraordinary meeting of the Council in late March reaffirmed this position. Nevertheless, violent conflict intensified in the first half of 2018, particularly in Central Equatoria, Jonglei and Unity states. On 12 September, following extensive engagement by IGAD and regional leaders, with support from the AU and other partners, the parties to the conflict, gathered in Addis Ababa during the 33rd extraordinary session of the IGAD Assembly, adopted a Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in South Sudan (R-ARCSS). The inaugural meeting was held in early December of a new Technical Boundary Committee, comprising members appointed by the IGAD member states and the (UK-USA-Norway) Troika, and supported by an international expert appointed by the UN. Its first task was to map and report to the IGAD mediation process on the tribal areas of South Sudan as they stood on 1 January 1956.</p>
                    <p>In May 2019 the parties to the R-ARCSS extended the pre-transition stage of the agreement by six months, until November, at which time a 36-month transition period was to commence, with elections scheduled to be held 60 days prior to the transition period’s end. Several pre-transition stage tasks, including the cantonment, screening, training and unification of forces, and the determination of the number and borders of states, remained to be finalized. Militant groupings that were not signatories to the R-ARCSS reportedly remained active in Central Equatoria, in particular in the Yei area. In November parties to the R-ARCSS agreed to extend the pre-transition stage for a further 100 days.&#160;On 22 February 2020 Kiir and Machar concluded a power-sharing agreement, formally ending the civil war. Accordingly, a new Revitalized Transitional Government of National Unity (RTGoNU) was established. The IGAD Executive Secretary congratulated President Kiir and First Vice-President Machar, and other South Sudanese leaders, on the formation of the RTGoNU in mid-March. An extraordinary meeting of the IGAD Council of Ministers held by videoconference in April called on stakeholders in South Sudan promptly to reconstitute the Transitional National Legislative Assembly, in accordance with provisions of the R-ARCSS. In May, in the context of combating the spread of COVID-19, the IGAD Special Envoy for South Sudan urged an immediate cessation of intercommunal and all other forms of violence, to ensure access to health care and the protection of frontline health workers. In late August the IGAD Executive Secretary issued an appeal for support for response and rehabilitation activities that were ongoing in areas of South Sudan (particularly the Jonglei, Upper Nile and Warrap regions) that had been devastated by flooding. IGAD organized, in December, a national consultative meeting on halting the illicit circulation of small arms and light weapons in Sudan. In March 2021 the IGAD Special Envoy congratulated RTGoNU and opposition factions for recommitting to the 2017 cessation of aggression agreement and to substantive political negotiations. At the beginning of June 2021 a joint delegation that included representatives of IGAD, the AU, and UNMISS visited Pibor, in eastern South Sudan, where intercommunal violence had recently escalated. In August IGAD and UNMISS stated concern at divisions that had emerged within Riek Machar’s&#160;Sudan People’s Liberation Movement/Army-in-Opposition (SPLM/A-IO), that had led to unrest in Magenis, Upper Nile. IGAD’s Executive Secretary and the IGAD Special Envoy for South Sudan undertook a three-day fact-finding mission to South Sudan in that month, during which they met President Kiir and First Vice-President Machar. In mid-September a peace mission comprising delegates from IGAD, UNMISS and other partners visited Tambura, in Western Equatoria, where since June some 80,000 people had been displaced by conflict. South Sudan was temporarily suspended from participation in IGAD in December 2021 for non-payment of dues. IGAD subsequently continued to support efforts to implement in full the R-ARCSS, amid ongoing intercommunal violence in the country. In July 2022 the 39th extraordinary IGAD summit called on all stakeholders to draft a roadmap setting out clear benchmarks and timelines to support the completion of the 36-month transition period. In the following month the RTGoNU adopted an Agreement on the Roadmap to a Peaceful and Democratic End to the Transitional Period in South Sudan; this extended by 24 months the transitional period provided for under the R-ARCSS, to 22 February 2025. IGAD, UNMISS and the AU formed a technical trilateral mechanism in August 2022 that was focused on supporting the process of drafting a permanent national constitution. In December IGAD’s Executive Secretary stated extreme concern over recent reports of escalating violent turmoil in Jonglei and Upper Nile states, that had reportedly prompted the displacement of around 50,000 people. In February 2023 the RTGoNU asked the UN, the AU and IGAD for assistance in establishing a joint taskforce to support the advancement of the constitution-making and electoral processes; the inaugural meeting of the new taskforce was convened on 1 June. In May IGAD and the AU jointly initiated a post-conflict needs assessment for South Sudan.</p>

          In April 2019, following the overthrow of President Omar al-Bashir by the Sudanese military and the establishment of a military-led transitional regime in Khartoum, IGAD offered its support, in co-operation with the 
          <xr pageref="N" ref="AU.IO">AU</xr>
          , in enabling Sudanese stakeholders to ensure a peaceful transition to the restoration of civil political authority. In July the IGAD Executive Secretary welcomed the conclusion of an agreement by the Transitional Military Council of Sudan and the opposition that laid the framework for a return to civilian rule. In mid-August he congratulated the Sudanese people on the delivery of a constitutional decree on power sharing, and welcomed the appointment of Abdallah Hamdok as Prime Minister of the newly established Transitional Government of Sudan. IGAD welcomed the initialling on 31 August 2020, in Juba, South Sudan, of a peace agreement between the Transitional Government of Sudan and five opposition groupings. In December the 38th extraordinary session of IGAD heads of state and government commended the signature in October of the Juba Peace Agreement by the Transitional Government of Sudan and two further opposition militias. The IGAD Executive Secretary, and Norway, the UK and USA (the Troika countries) co-signed the Juba Peace Agreement in June 2021 as guarantors. On 25 October the Transitional Government of Sudan was overthrown in a military coup, the transitional institutions dissolved and the civilian leadership detained. IGAD’s Executive Secretary condemned any attempt to undermine the transitional authorities, and demanded the release of all the detained leaders. In November the Executive Secretary welcomed an agreement by the military to reinstate the Prime Minister and to release political leaders detained in the coup. 
        </p>
                    <p>An IGAD mission visited Sudan in January 2022 to pursue dialogue with all parties, following Hamdok’s resignation at the start of the year. In February IGAD organized a workshop in Nyala, with participation by representatives of local authorities, that extended technical assistance on conflict prevention, management and mediation, and peacebuilding. The detention of opposition supporters, meanwhile, was contributing to ongoing political protests and unrest. From April IGAD, with the UN mission in Sudan (UNITAMS) and the AU, undertook discussions with stakeholders to the Juba Peace Agreement in order to advance more formal political dialogue. They issued a joint statement, as the Trilateral AU-IGAD-UN Mechanism, in mid-May urging a lifting of the country’s state of emergency and an end to violence on the part of the authorities, and reiterated their support to restoring constitutional order. At the end of May IGAD’s Executive Secretary welcomed a decree issued by Sudan’s military regime that ended the state of emergency. The Trilateral Mechanism endorsed a new Political Framework Agreement signed in December by the military authorities and a coalition of civilian leaders, and initiated a series of workshops in the following month to strengthen the ongoing discussions regarding political transition; conclusive agreement remained elusive into 2023, however, including with regard to the proposed integration into the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) of the powerful paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). In mid-March the Trilateral Mechanism convened a National Conference: Towards Building a Sudanese Model for Justice and Transitional Justice, which issued a declaration of principles. On 15 April IGAD’s Executive Secretary stated alarm over the eruption of the ongoing RSF-SAF tensions into violent clashes across Khartoum and elsewhere, resulting in numerous fatalities. An extraordinary meeting of IGAD heads of state and of government that was convened the following day, in a virtual format, called for an immediate cessation of hostilities, urged the warring parties to ensure a safe corridor for the delivery of humanitarian assistance, and appointed the Presidents of Djibouti, Kenya and South Sudan to mediate between the RSF and SAF. On 20 April a (virtual) meeting to discuss means of addressing the crisis, convened between the IGAD Executive Secretary, the UN Secretary-General, the Arab League Secretary-General and the AU Chairperson, established an Expanded Mechanism on the Sudan Crisis. The Expanded Mechanism—comprising representatives of the Trilateral Mechanism (i.e. IGAD, the AU and UNITAMS), Arab League, EU, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (the `P5’), the three African member states then serving on the Council (the `A3’—Gabon, Ghana and Mozambique), states neighbouring Sudan, the states at that time designated by IGAD to mediate in the dispute (Djibouti, Kenya and South Sudan), the then AU Chair (Comoros), and other international stakeholders—was tasked with co-ordinating and harmonizing subregional, continental and international efforts to facilitate a peaceful resolution of the conflict. During May RSF and SAF negotiating teams participated in talks mediated by Saudi Arabia and the USA, in Jeddah (Saudi Arabia), resulting in several short-lived ceasefire agreements. In mid-June the Governor of West Darfur was killed, having recently attributed mounting civilian fatalities to actions of the RSF. Meanwhile, the 14th ordinary IGAD Assembly, meeting in Djibouti, adopted an IGAD Roadmap for Peace in the Republic of Sudan, and expanded the group of states mandated to mediate the dispute to include Ethiopia.</p>
                    <p>In early July 2023 IGAD convened a high-level meeting in Addis Ababa aimed at prompting onwards peace negotiations. The Sudanese government delegation, however, refused to attend, accusing Kenya’s President Ruto of bias in favour of the RSF, and rejected an IGAD proposal to consider the deployment of a regional peacekeeping force to protect civilians in Sudan. The first meeting of the IGAD Quartet on Sudan—i.e. comprising the heads of state and or government of Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya and South Sudan—was held in mid-July; a commitment was made to facilitating an in-person meeting between the warring parties. The second meeting of the IGAD Quartet on Sudan, with participation by the IGAD Executive Secretary and Chairperson of the AU Commission, was held in early September—by which time several thousand people had been killed, injured or displaced as a result of the crisis. The Quartet noted with concern that the conflict was escalating, and that its scope was extending into outlying regions; it suggested that all ongoing relevant peace initiatives should be consolidated, within the framework of an all-inclusive platform to be led jointly by IGAD and the AU. IGAD and the AU were requested to advance preparations for a political dialogue on a Sudanese-owned political process. Some US&#8201;$1m. was to be mobilized from every IGAD member state to support humanitarian and peace activities in Sudan. Diplomatic efforts to secure a political dialogue were intensified by the grouping in early December. However, efforts by IGAD to mediate a face-to-face meeting between the head of the Sudanese armed forces, Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the leader of the RSF, Gen. Mohamed Dagalo, to which the two initially agreed, faltered following a diplomatic tour conducted by the latter at the end of the month to several African nations, to which al-Burhan objected. In mid-January 2024 the Sudanese authorities suspended participation in IGAD’s mediation efforts and its membership of the organization, in response to an invitation extended by IGAD to the RSF leader to participate in an extraordinary summit convened at that time (with a view to organizing direct talks between the parties to the conflict). At that time the IGAD leaders restated readiness to extend good offices to facilitate an all-inclusive peace process, and directed the IGAD Secretariat, in co-ordination with the AU, to draft a revised roadmap towards peace. They also emphasized that Sudan belongs to its people, and not to the warring parties. In March IGAD appointed a new Special Envoy for Sudan.</p>
