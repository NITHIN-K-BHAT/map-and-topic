The Board normally meets once a year. The Board of Governors has delegated many of its powers to the Executive Directors. However, certain important powers including the conditions governing the admission of new members, adjustment of quotas, and the election of Executive Directors remain the sole responsibility of the Board of Governors.</p>

        , advises and reports to the Board on matters relating to the management and adaptation of the international monetary and financial system, sudden disturbances that might threaten the system and proposals to amend the Articles of Agreement. The Committee guides IMF policy but has no decision-making authority. Twice a year the IMF Managing Director presents to the IMFC a Global Policy Agenda, which identifies pressing policy challenges confronting member states.

               <p>In late March 2020 the IMF Managing Director welcomed the efforts of major central banks to ease monetary policy in response to the escalating COVID-19 crisis, and commended fiscal actions implemented by many governments to protect workers and companies in the interim, and to boost health systems. The Managing Director pledged that, under the unprecedented and extraordinary circumstances, the Fund was ready to deploy all its lending capacity and would increase emergency finance massively. At that time the IMF announced US $50,000m. in funding to support poor and middle-income member states with weak health systems to respond to the pandemic; some $10,000m. of this funding was in the form of zero interest rapid emergency loans. Meanwhile, the IMF’s Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust (CCRT), which provides debt relief to countries hit by catastrophic events, was being urgently replenished to enable the poorest economies to maximize and focus all available resources towards combating the pandemic; a first tranche of CCRT grants was extended in mid-April. Also at that time, the Fund, the World Bank Group and the G20 membership agreed a Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI), providing for the temporary suspension of the debt service payments of up to 73 eligible countries (40 of which were in Africa).</p>
               <p>
        In January 2021 the IMF estimated that the global economy had contracted by -3.5% in 2020, and noted that women, youth, workers in informal employment, workers in contact-intensive sectors, and people already living in poverty had been particularly adversely affected by the impacts of the pandemic crisis. From June 2021 the IMF Managing Director participated, with the heads of the World Bank, the 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-UN.2442">World Health Organization</xr>
         and the 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="WTO.IO">World Trade Organization (WTO)</xr>
        , in a Multilateral Leaders Taskforce on vaccines access. They collectively issued a call for action to generate US&#8201;$50,000m. in new financing to support a comprehensive health, trade and finance roadmap aimed at bringing an end to the crisis. Meanwhile, the IMF was preparing an unprecedented new SDR allocation to assist its member states (see 
        <i>Special Drawing Rights</i>
        ). The amount of debt service suspended through the DSSI during May 2020-December 2021 (when it expired, having twice been extended, in November 2020 and in April 2021) totalled $12,900m.; 48 of the 73 eligible countries participated in the initiative. During April 2020-9 March 2022 some 31 states received SDR&#8201;689.6m. (equivalent to $965.3m.) in debt relief through the CCRT (which had been extended through five tranches). By 9 March 2022 (the date of the final published update on such support) the IMF was making available to member states financial assistance and debt service relief totalling around $250,000m.

               <p>
        In early March 2022, in response to the Russian Federation’s military invasion of Ukraine, the IMF warned of the severe impact on the global economy of the onwards consequences of the war, with unprecedented economic, financial and communications sanctions having been imposed against Russia, and global energy and grain prices rising significantly. In May the IMF, World Bank and other international financial institutions (IFIs) collectively issued a joint IFI Action Plan to Address Food Insecurity. The IMF was also to intensify collaboration in support of debt restructurings, was to provide emergency assistance where necessary, and was to use a new Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) and associated Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) to provide affordable longer term financing for low-income and vulnerable middle-income countries (including small states) that were implementing structural transitions to meet long-term challenges such as pandemic preparedness and climate change adaptation. In January 2023 the IMF’s 
        <publ-name>Global Economic Outlook</publ-name>
         estimated global economic growth in 2022 at 3.4%, and the average global rate of inflation in that year at 8.8% (significantly higher than the level of around 3.5% across 2017-19). The protracted conflict in Ukraine and rises in central bank rates aimed at combating inflation were reported to be subduing economic expansion. The report recommended that broad-based fiscal relief measures should be removed, with fiscal support more efficiently targeted at the most vulnerable people who were most impacted by elevated food and energy costs.
      </p>
               <p>In February 2023 the heads of the IMF, the World Bank Group, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN, the World Food Programme and the WTO issued a third joint statement on the global food and nutrition security crisis (further to statements issued in July and September of the previous year). The statement highlighted ongoing initiatives to counter the escalating crisis of rising food and fertilizer prices and falling production, and identified urgent actions to be undertaken.</p>

         observed in April 2023 the recent sudden failures of two US banks and loss of market confidence in Credit Suisse (a `global systemically important bank’). An IMF Conference on Geoeconomic Fragmentation that was convened in the following month, in Washington, DC, gave consideration to a trend of plateauing global flows of goods and capital and parallel surge in trade restrictions, noting the impacts of an uneven recovery from the 2008-09 global financial crisis, of trade tensions between the USA and China, of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union (EU) and European single market, and of a mounting number of military conflicts. The October 2023 edition of the

         acknowledged a relaxation of acute stress on the global banking system, although there were outstanding concerns regarding high inflation and prospects for global growth.

               <p>Members' fully paid quota subscriptions, in the form of currencies and reserve assets, serve as the principal resources of the IMF. The IMF’s resources are held in three accounts: a main General Resources Account; a Special Disbursement Account, in which profits from sales of the Fund’s gold are invested; and an Investment Account. The IMF’s quota resources may be supplemented by borrowing.</p>
               <p-group id="IMF.IO.SDRS.1">
                    <heading>Special Drawing Rights (SDRs)</heading>
                    <p>The SDR was introduced in 1970 as a substitute for gold in international payments, and was intended eventually to become the principal reserve asset in the international monetary system. SDRs are allocated to members in proportion to their quotas. In September 1997 the Executive Board approved a special allocation of SDR&#8201;21,400m., in order to ensure an SDR to quota ratio of 29.32%, for all member countries: the ensuing Fourth Amendment to the Articles of Agreement came into effect on 10 August 2009, following its acceptance by 60% of member countries, having 85% of the total voting power, and the special allocation, equivalent to some US&#8201;$33,000m., was implemented on 9 September. Also in August the Board of Governors approved a third general allocation of SDRs, amounting to SDR&#8201;161,200m., on the basis of recommendations made in April by the IMFC and by G20 heads of state and government, in response to the then global financial crisis; this became available to all members effective from 28 August. In April 2021 the IMFC urged the IMF to propose a new SDR general allocation amounting to $650,000m. (some SDR 456,000m.) aimed at boosting member countries’ reserves and liquidity in the context of the ongoing recovery from the COVID-19 crisis; this was approved by the Board of Governors on 2 August.</p>
                    <p>The list of currencies and the weight of each in the SDR valuation basket is revised every five years (ongoing valuation period: 1 August 2022-31 July 2027). In November 2015 the Executive Board resolved to incorporate the Chinese renminbi into the valuation basket, with effect from 1 October 2016, in addition to the currencies of the European Economic and Monetary Union (the euro), Japan (yen), the UK (pound sterling) and the USA (US dollar) (which had made up the basket since 1999). The value of the SDR averaged US&#8201;$1.33403 in 2023. It stood at $1.31475 on 1 May 2024.</p>
                    <p usage="edio">The Second Amendment to the Articles of Agreement (1978) altered and expanded the possible uses of the SDR in transactions with other participants. These `prescribed holders' of the SDRs have the same degree of freedom as Fund members to buy and sell SDRs and to receive or use them in loans, pledges, swaps, donations or settlement of financial obligations.</p>

               <p-group id="IMF.IO.QUOTAS.1">
                    <heading>Quotas</heading>
                    <p>Each member is assigned a quota related to its national income, monetary reserves, trade balance and other economic indicators. A member's subscription is equal to its quota and is payable partly in SDRs and partly in its own currency. The quota determines a member's voting power, which is based on one vote for each SDR&#160;100,000 of its quota plus the 250 votes to which each member is entitled. A member's quota also determines its access to the financial resources of the IMF, and its allocation of SDRs.</p>
                    <p>Quotas are reviewed at five-yearly intervals, to take into account the state of the world economy and members' different rates of development. Special increases, separate from each General Review, may be made in exceptional circumstances.</p>
                    <p usage="edio">In September 2006 the Board of Governors adopted a resolution on Quota and Voice Reform in the IMF, representing a two-year reform package aimed at improving the alignment of the quota shares of member states to represent more accurately their relative positions in the global economy and also to enhance the participation and influence of emerging market and low-income countries. An immediate ad hoc quota increase was approved for China, the Republic of Korea, Mexico and Turkey (now known as Türkiye). In March 2008 the Executive Board approved a second round of ad hoc quota increases as part of the proposed extensive reform of the governance and quota structure. Having been accepted by member states representing 85% of the total votes, the so-called 2008 Quota and Voice Reform agreement entered into effect in March 2011, providing for quota increases for 54 member countries with emerging or dynamic economies and an increase in basic votes for low-income countries, in order to strengthen their participation mechanism.</p>
                    <p usage="ewyb edio">In December 2010 the Board of Governors endorsed an agreement concluding the 14th General Review of Quotas to provide for a 100% increase in quotas, to some SDR&#8201;476,800m., and adjustment of quota shares to ensure appropriate representation for emerging economies and developing countries. The agreement included a commitment to undertake a comprehensive review of the quota formula by January 2013 (this was achieved) and to conclude a 15th General Review—on the basis of the comprehensive review—by January 2014 (this deadline was subsequently postponed). Furthermore, governance reforms to the Board, requiring acceptance of three-fifths of members representing 85% of voting power, were to be implemented. The 14th General Review, which required consent by members holding 70% of total quotas, could only enter into effect once the proposed Board reforms had received the required approval. Sufficient approval was received to enable the quota increase and Board Reform Amendment to enter into effect on 26 January 2016.</p>
                    <p>In December 2023, on the basis of a recommendation agreed in early November by the Executive Board, the Board of Governors adopted a Resolution that concluded the 16th General Review of Quotas. This provided for a 50% increase in quotas (in proportion to each member’s existing quota), to be completed by a deadline of 15 November 2024, at which time total quotas in the Fund were to reach SDR&#8201;715,700m. (Governors accounting for 92.86% of the total voting power on the Board approved the Resolution, exceeding the threshold required of 85%.) The Resolution envisaged that, following the increase in quota resources, reliance on borrowed resources would be reduced. As at May 2024 total quotas in the Fund amounted to SDR&#8201;476,272.0m. </p>

                    <heading>Borrowing</heading>
                    <p>In May 1996 the participants (11 member states and central banks) in the General Arrangements to Borrow (GAB, established in 1962), concluded an agreement in principle to expand resources available for borrowing from SDR 17,000m. to SDR&#160;34,000m., by securing the support of 25 countries with the financial capacity to assist the international monetary system. Consequently the New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB) was approved by the Executive Board in January 1997 and became effective in November 1998. The GAB ended on 25 December 2018 (the participants having agreed in December 2017 that the initiative had only limited usefulness).</p>
                    <p>In April 2009 G20 heads of state and of government resolved to expand the NAB facility, to incorporate all G20 economies, in order to increase its resources by up to SDR&#8201;367,500m. (US&#8201;$500,000m.). They also agreed to support a general allocation of SDRs amounting to a further $250,000m., and to use additional resources from sales of IMF gold to provide $6,000m. in concessional financing for the poorest countries over the next two to three years. In April 2010 the IMF Executive Board approved the expansion and enlargement of NAB borrowing arrangements to SDR&#8201;369,997m.; this came into effect in March 2011. EU heads of state and of government agreed in December to allocate to the IMF additional resources of up to $270,000m. in the form of bilateral loans. At meetings held in April and June 2012 G20 member states pledged to increase by more than $456,000m. resources to be made available to the IMF as part of a universal protective firewall to serve the Fund’s entire membership. In June the Executive Board approved the modalities to enable bilateral borrowing from member countries as a means of supplementing both quota resources and the institution’s standing borrowing arrangements; the Board agreed a new framework in August 2016 to maintain temporary access to bilateral borrowing. During 2021-23 some 40 Bilateral Borrowing Agreements were in effect, with a value of around SDR&#8201;135,000m. NAB resources were limited to SDR&#8201;182,000m. in February 2016, and increased in January 2020 to SDR&#8201;364,700m. Concluding the 16th General Review of Quotas in December 2023, the Board of Governors determined that Bilateral Borrowing Agreements would be phased out and that NAB resources would once again be reduced. Specific proposals on the limitation of NAB resources were to be considered by the Executive Board in early 2024, following consultations with creditors.</p>

               <heading>Lending</heading>
               <p>The Fund makes resources available to eligible members on an essentially short-term and revolving basis to provide temporary assistance to contribute to the solution of their payments problems. The IMF holds both usable currencies (where the external payments position of the issuing member is strong) and unusable (weak) currencies. A member obtaining IMF resources `purchases’—draws—either SDRs, or else the currency of another member in exchange for an equivalent amount (in SDR terms) of its own currency (so-called exchange purchases). The member then later `repurchases’ its own currency—i.e. reverses the transaction.</p>
               <p>Before making a purchase, a member must show that its balance of payments or reserve position makes the purchase necessary. Apart from this requirement, reserve tranche purchases (i.e. purchases that do not bring the Fund's holdings of the member's currency to a level above its quota) are permitted unconditionally. With further purchases, however, the Fund's policy of conditional­ity means that a recipient country must agree to adjust its economic policies, as stipulated by the IMF. All requests other than for use of the reserve tranche are examined by the Executive Board to determine whether the proposed use would be consistent with the Fund's policies, and a member must discuss its proposed adjustment programme (including fiscal, monetary, exchange and trade policies) with IMF staff. In March 2009 the Executive Board approved reforms to modernize the Fund’s conditionality policy, including greater use of pre-set qualification criteria and monitoring structural policy implementation by programme review (rather than by structural performance criteria).</p>
               <p>Purchases outside the reserve tranche are made in four credit tranches, each equivalent to 25% of the member's quota; a member must then repurchase its own currency within a specified timescale. A credit tranche purchase is usually made under a Stand-by Arrangement (SBA) with the Fund (the core lending instrument, created in 1952 and revised in 2009), or under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF, launched in 1974). An SBA is normally of one to three years' duration, and the amount is made available in instalments, subject to the member's observance of performance criteria; repurchases must be made within three-and-a-quarter to five years. Repurchases under the EFF must be made within four-and-a-half to 10 years.</p>
               <p>Members’ annual access to IMF resources is reviewed periodically. In February 2016 the Executive Board set the annual access limit under the General Resources Account at up to 145% of a member’s quota, with the cumulative access limit set at 435%, with higher access considered in exceptional circumstances. On 6 March 2023 the annual access limit was temporarily increased to 200%, and the cumulative access limit raised to 600%, for 12 months; this period was extended further in March 2024 until 31 December.</p>
               <p usage="edio">An Emergency Financing Mechanism was established in 1995 to enable a swift response to potential or actual financial crises, while additional funds were made available for short-term currency sta­bilization. The Mechanism was activated during the 1997 Asian financial crisis; for Turkey in 2001; for Armenia, Georgia, Hungary, Iceland, Latvia, Pakistan, and Ukraine in 2008-09; and for Cyprus, Greece, Ireland and Portugal during 2010-13.</p>
               <p>In January 2010 the Fund introduced new concessional facilities for low-income countries as part of broader reforms to enhance flexibility of lending and to focus support closer to specific national requirements. The three new facilities aimed to support country-owned programmes to achieve macroeconomic positions consistent with sustainable poverty reduction and economic growth. They carried a zero interest rate, although this was to be reviewed every two years. An Extended Credit Facility (ECF) succeeded the former Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF, used during 1999-2009) to provide medium-term balance of payments assistance to low-income members. ECF loans were repayable over 10 years, with a five-and-a-half-year grace period. A Stand-by Credit Facility (SCF) replaced the high-access component of a former Exogenous Shocks Facility (operational from January 2006-December 2009) in order to provide short-term balance of payments financial assistance in response to the adverse economic impact of events beyond government control, including on a precautionary basis. SCF loans were repayable over eight years, with a grace period of four years. A Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) was to provide financial assistance to low-income members requiring urgent balance of payments assistance, under a range of circumstances. Loans were repayable over 10 years, with a five-and-a-half-year grace period. In November 2011 a Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) was launched, for which all member states were eligible, and which was designed to support urgent balance of payments requirements, including those arising from exogenous shocks such as commodity price changes, natural disasters, and post-conflict and other extreme situations. Low-income member states may also make use of a non-financial Policy Support Instrument (PSI), providing access to IMF monitoring and other support aimed at consolidating economic performance. In June 2023 exceptional higher access limits under the RCF and RFI were extended until 30 June 2024. In December 2023 the Executive Board also temporarily raised the annual access limit under the PRGT.</p>
               <p usage="ewyb edio sasia sacac ass mena fea">In February 2015 the IMF transformed its Post-Catastrophe Debt Relief Trust, established in 2010 following the devastating earthquake in Haiti, into the CCRT. With a similar objective of providing debt relief to low-income member states in order to free up resources to meet exceptional balance of payments needs, the CCRT incorporated a new window to support states affected by public health crises, in addition to a window to respond to natural disasters.</p>
               <p>In September 2022 the Executive Board approved a temporary Food Shock Window (FSW) under the RCF, to provide emergency financing for balance of payments assistance relating to the volatility of food supplies and production. Under the FSW (which in June 2023 was extended until 31 March 2024) member states were permitted to access up to 50% of their quota.</p>

               <p>In March 2009 the Executive Board introduced a Flexible Credit Line (FCL) facility, which provided credit to countries with very strong economic foundations, but was also to be primarily considered as precautionary. The FCL had a repayment period of up to five years and no access `cap'. In August 2010 the duration of the FCL, and credit available through it, were increased. In November 2011 a relatively flexible Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL) was initiated, which was to be made available to countries `with sound economic fundamentals’ and `sound policies’ that were encountering broadly challenging circumstances—including as insurance against shocks and as a short-term liquidity window. PLL arrangements may have a duration of either six months or one to two years.</p>

        In March 2012 the Executive Board approved an allocation of SDR&#160;23,785m. to be distributed under the EFF, as part of a (second) bailout package in support of ongoing economic adjustment activities in Greece. In February 2015, following the election in January of a new Greek Government, the IMF Managing Director noted that the new administration had not as yet committed to developing and implementing policy reforms that were considered by the Fund to be of critical importance in determining Greece’s likelihood of meeting agreed economic adjustment objectives. On 30 June 2015 Greece defaulted on its required payments to the IMF, representing the first default to the Fund by an advanced economy. A majority of voters at a referendum organized on 5 July by the Greek authorities rejected the terms of a two-part economic plan proposed in late June by the IMF, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Commission. On 13 July a eurozone leaders’ summit agreed a third bailout package for Greece, to comprise €86,000m. in financing over the next three years, on condition that key reforms—facilitating,
        <i> inter alia</i>
        , increased revenues from value-added, corporate and luxury goods taxation, and a more cost-efficient national pensions system based on a higher retirement age—were endorsed by the Greek legislature on 15 July (this was achieved). On 14 July the IMF issued an updated debt sustainability analysis on the situation which warned that without greater debt relief Greece would not be able to meet long-term commitments under the new bailout arrangement. On 20 July, following the release of funding to Greece by the ECB, the Greek arrears to the IMF—amounting to SDR 1,592m.—were cleared. In May 2016 the IMF welcomed an agreement by the Eurogroup on a package of measures to facilitate repayment of the Greek debt. In July 2017 the Executive Board approved in principle an SDR&#8201;1,300m. SBA in support of Greece’s ongoing economic reform programme, with disbursement to be dependent on the continuing implementation of the programme, and on specific assurances from eurozone governments relating to ensuring Greece’s debt sustainability. Greece completed its EU bailout programme in late August 2018. The IMF SBA also expired in that month. In March 2019, following the conclusion in late January of the First Post-Program Monitoring Discussions between the IMF and the Greek authorities, the IMF stated that Greece’s economic recovery was accelerating and broadening. The IMF Executive Board reported in June 2022 that Greece’s economy had recovered well from a severe recession prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic, attributing the strong performance to an appropriate fiscal response, accommodative monetary policy, ongoing reforms (for example in digitization), and to significant support from the EU. In April 2023 the Fund forecast that Greece’s economy would expand by 2.6% during that year.

               <p usage="ewyb edio ass sacac sasia fea">Under an enhanced heavily indebted poor countries (HIPCs) initiative agreed by the IMF and World Bank in September 1999, countries seeking debt relief were first to formulate, and then successfully to implement for at least one year, a national poverty reduction strategy. (Some 41 HIPCs had been identified, of which 33 were in sub-Saharan Africa.) In September 2005 the IMF and World Bank endorsed a G8 proposal—subsequently referred to as the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI)—to provide additional resources to achieve the full cancellation of debts owed by eligible HIPCs; countries that had reached their completion point were to qualify for immediate assistance. The IMF's Executive Board determined, additionally, to extend MDRI debt relief to all countries with an annual per caput gross domestic product of US&#8201;$380, to be financed by IMF's own resources. Other financing was to be made from existing bilateral contributions to a dedicated trust account. The initiative became effective in January 2006. In February 2015, given that there was no outstanding MDRI-eligible debt to the Fund, the IMF Executive Board decided to transfer related funds held in trust to the CCRT.</p>

The IMF recognizes 34 `Small Developing States’ (SDS), i.e. states (excluding advanced and fuel exporting economies) with populations smaller than 1.5m. Of these states, 27 were SIDS, two were landlocked, and five were coastal. Fifteen of the SDS, with fewer than 200,000 inhabitants, were classified by the IMF as `microstates’. Some 12 SDS (all of them SIDS) are located in the Caribbean, 11 (all SIDS) in the Pacific, seven in Africa, and four in Europe and Asia. The IMF considers one-half of the SDS globally to be offshore financial centres.</p>

        Under its Articles of Agreement, the Fund is mandated to oversee the effective functioning of the international monetary system. The main tools of surveillance are regular, bilateral consultations with member countries conducted in accordance with Article IV of the Articles of Agreement, which cover fiscal and monetary policies, balance of payments and external debt developments, as well as policies that affect the economic performance of a country, such as the labour market, social and environmental issues and good governance, and aspects of the country's capital accounts, and finance and banking sectors. The Executive Board monitors global economic developments and discusses policy implications from a multilateral perspective, based partly on

        . In July 2012 the Executive Board adopted a Decision on Bilateral and Multilateral Surveillance (the so-called Integrated Surveillance Decision), which aimed to strengthen the legal framework underpinning surveillance activities. In September the Board endorsed a Financial Surveillance Strategy detailing steps towards further strengthening the financial surveillance framework.

SDDS Plus, introduced in 2012, covers an expanded set of data categories. By January 2024 78 countries or territories had subscribed to the SDDS, of which 31 had graduated to SDDS Plus. A Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board aims to ensure that information on SDDS subscribing countries is widely available.
