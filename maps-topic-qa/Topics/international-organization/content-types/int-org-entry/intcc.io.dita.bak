          <p id="IO-INTCC.2">The ICC was established by the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which was adopted by 120 states participating in a United Nations (UN) Diplomatic Conference in July 1998. The Statute (and therefore also the ICC’s temporal jurisdiction) entered into force on 1 July 2002. At May 2024 the Statute had 124 states parties.</p>
          <!--entered into effect for Armenia 8.ii.24-->
          <p usage="ewyb edio">The Court is a permanent, independent body, in relationship with the UN, that is mandated to hold individuals accountable for orchestrating the most serious crimes of concern to the international community, such as crimes against humanity, genocide, war crimes and international aggression. The guiding Negotiated Relationship Agreement between the International Criminal Court and the UN, which entered into force in October 2004, provides for extensive mutual exchange of information and documentation, and for co-operation and consultation on practical matters.</p>
          <p>
      Amendments to the Rome Statute that were adopted in December 2017 extended its scope to cover the use of non-detectable fragment weapons; blinding laser weapons; and biological and toxic weapons. In July 2018 amendments entered into effect that characterized the use of certain weaponry during non-international conflict as a war crime, and defined international aggression as the use of armed force by a state against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of another, or in any other manner inconsistent with the UN Charter. A further amendment (adopted in December 2019) designated the deliberate starvation of civilians in a non-international conflict as a war crime. In March 2021 an ICC Case Law Database was launched. A revised version of the 
      <publ-name>Code of Judicial Ethics of the International Criminal Court</publ-name>
       entered into force in October 2022. The Prosecutor has issued policy initiatives on gender persecution (in 2022), on gender-based crimes (in 2023), on children (also in 2023), on environmental crimes (in February 2024), and on slavery crimes (in March).
    </p>
          <p>The Court comprises the Presidency (consisting of a President and first and second Vice-Presidents), three divisions (Pre-Trial, Trial and Appeals) with 18 permanent judges, the Office of the Prosecutor (comprising the Prosecutor, Deputy Prosecutor, and heads of divisions of Investigations; Prosecutions; and Jurisdiction, Complementarity and Cooperation), and the Registry. The judges must each have a different nationality and equitably represent the major legal systems of the world, a fair geographical distribution, and a fair proportion of men and women. They are elected to terms of office of three, six or nine years by the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute, from two lists: the first comprising candidates with established competence in criminal law and procedures and the second comprising candidates with established competence in relevant areas of international law. The President and Vice-Presidents are elected by an absolute majority of the judges for renewable three-year terms of office. The Prosecutor is elected by an absolute majority of states parties to the Rome Statute to a non-renewable nine-year term of office.</p>
          <p>
      The Court has established a Trust Fund for Victims (TFV) to finance mandated reparations (including compensation, restitution, or rehabilitation), and other assistance, for victims (individ­uals or groups of individuals) of crimes under the jurisdiction of the Court. The Fund is administered by an independent board of directors and secretariat, led by an Executive Director. By 1 May 2024 the ICC had issued five decisions on reparations for victims, relating to the convictions of Thomas Lubanga, Germain Katanga and Bosco Ntaganda (see 
      <i>Situation in the DRC I</i>
      ), Ahmad al-Mahdi (see 
      <i>Situation in Mali</i>
      ), and Dominic Ongwen (see 
      <i>Situation in Uganda</i>
      ). Collective service-based reparations to victims provide education and training (aimed at advancing socioeconomic prospects); income-generating activities; pensions; subsistence allowances; and psychological and physical health care. By 2024 the TFV had, since 2004, received donations exceeding €53m. In 2023-25 the Fund was implementing programmes in the Central African Republic (CAR), Côte d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Georgia, Kenya, Mali and Uganda.
    </p>
          <p>By May 2024 31 cases had been brought before the ICC for investigation. Three preliminary investigations were underway at that time.</p>
          <p>
      In January 2017 the 28th 
      <xr pageref="N" ref="AU.IO">African Union (AU)</xr>
       Assembly adopted a non-binding decision that supported a strategy of collective African withdrawal from the Court. Various diplomatic efforts have subsequently been undertaken with a view to strengthening relations between the Court and Africa.
    </p>
          <p usage="ass">In June 2019 representatives of African parties to the Rome Statute, the ICC, the TFV, the AU, the European Union and the Organisation de la Francophonie collectively participated in a Retreat, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, with a view to strengthening dialogue on the mandate and activities of the ICC.</p>
          <p usage="ass ewyb edio">In October 2016 Burundi announced its intention to withdraw from the Rome Statute, the first country ever to do so; this took effect in October 2017. Later in October 2016, South Africa and then The Gambia determined to withdraw, also with a year’s notice. In February 2017, however, a newly elected administration in The Gambia rescinded that country’s notice. In the same month the South African high court found the government’s withdrawal to be unconstitutional and invalid, and consequently it was revoked in March.</p>
          <p usage="ewyb edio">In March 2018 the Philippines declared its intention to withdraw from the Rome Statute; this took effect in March 2019. In November 2016 the Russian Federation withdrew from the Rome Statute accessions process. Malaysia signed the instrument of accession to the Statute in March 2016 but reversed its decision to join in April, stating that the move remained controversial within the country.</p>

                    <p>The Extraordinary African Chambers became operational in February 2013, on the basis of an accord adopted in August 2012 by the African Union (AU) and the Government of Senegal, to try the former President of Chad, Hissène Habré (who had been resident in Senegal), on charges of having committed—as a member of a `joint criminal enterprise’—crimes against humanity and torture, and—on the grounds of his presidential responsibility—war crimes, in Chad during the period 7 June 1982-1 December 1990 (i.e. the duration of his term in office as President of Chad); around 40,000 people were reported to have been killed as a result of his alleged crimes. The Chambers represented the first `universal jurisdiction’ criminal process in Africa, with grave crimes allegedly committed in one territory being tried, by judges of various (African) nationalities, in another, under the overall stewardship of the AU. The AU Commission appointed the judges of the tribunal from among its member states. Formal proceedings against Habré commenced in July 2015 and concluded in February 2016. In May the Court found Habré guilty in respect of crimes committed against humanity, summary executions, torture and rape, and sentenced him to life imprisonment. An appeal against the verdict was lodged by Habré in June, and was heard in January 2017. In April the Court overturned Habré’s rape conviction, while upholding the remaining convictions and ordering that 82,000,000m. francs CFA should be paid in reparations to his victims. Habré died in August 2021.</p>

                    <p id="HYBRIDINTCC.IO.22">Formally established as the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia for the Prosecution of Crimes Committed during the Period of Democratic Kampuchea (17 April 1975-6 January 1979), the ECCC was inaugurated in July 2006 on the basis of an agreement concluded in June 2003 between the Cambod­ian Government and the UN. The ECCC is mandated to prosecute senior leaders of the former Khmer Rouge regime for serious contraventions of Cambod­ian and international law—including crimes against humanity, genocide and war crimes—committed during the period 17 April 1975-6 January 1979. The ECCC is a hybrid Cambod­ian tribunal with international participation, incorporating Cambod­ian and international judges and personnel. It applies international standards and acts independently of the Cambod­ian Government and the UN. The ECCC comprises a Pre-Trial Chamber, Trial Chamber and Supreme Court Chamber; an Office of the Co-Prosecutors; an Office of the Co-Investigating Judges; a Defence Support section; a Victims' Unit; and an Office of Administration. Victims may file complaints before the ECCC, and may apply to become Civil Parties to the proceedings. In February 2013 the Court determined to annul a previous ruling that had hitherto prevented the prosecution of alleged crimes of conflict-related sexual violence committed under the Khmer Rouge regime, such as rape, sexual slavery, and also forced marriage—which had allegedly been employed systematically with a view to severing traditional family bonds and manipulating citizens’ loyalties. On 1 January 2023 the ECCC entered a residual phase, initially scheduled to last for three years, during which its functions included the enforcement of sentences, protection of victims and witnesses, management of records and archives, outreach. An ECCC Resource Centre was initiated in September to pursue educational and outreach activities. The ECCC’s proposed budget for 2024 totalled US&#8201;$5.1m.</p>
                    <p>
          In February 2009 the ECCC initiated proceedings against its first defendant, Kaing Guek Eav (also known as Duch), who had been charged under international law with crimes against humanity and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, and under Cambod­ian national law with homicide and torture offences, in relation to his former role as director of Tuol Sleng (`S-21’) security centre, where at least 15,000 prisoners had been tortured and executed. In July 2010 Kaing Guek Eav was found guilty and sentenced to 35 years’ imprisonment; in February 2012, following an appeal in that case, lodged in March 2011, Kaing Guek Eav’s sentence was increased to life imprisonment. He died incarcerated in September 2020. Other senior figures of the Khmer Rouge regime indicted on charges of crimes against humanity were Nuon Chea, formerly the Deputy Secretary of the Party of Democratic Kampuchea; Ieng Sary, formerly Minister of Foreign Affairs; Khieu Samphan, formerly President of the State Presidium; and Ieng Thirith, formerly Minister of Social Affairs and Action. Ieng Sary died in detention, of natural causes, in March 2013, and Ieng Thirith (who had been released in view of a diagnosis of clinical dementia) died in August 2015. Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea were found guilty and sentenced to life terms of imprisonment in August 2014. The Supreme Court upheld the life sentences in November 2016. In November 2018 both men were found guilty—through their acts and omissions—on further counts of genocide, grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions and crimes against humanity committed during 1977-79. Nuon Chea died (of natural causes) in August 2019. In March 2015 former Khmer Rouge official Ao An (also known as Ta An) was charged with premeditated murder, extermination, persecution, imprisonment, and other inhumane acts, that he had allegedly perpetrated at the Kok Pring execution site, and at the Tuol Beng and Wat Au Trakuon security centres; further charges relating, 
          <i>inter alia</i>
          , to genocide of the Cham community, other acts of murder, and enslavement, were announced in March 2016. The case was subject to prolonged procedural disputes. In August 2020 the Supreme Chamber of the ECCC terminated the case, on the grounds that no agreement had hitherto been reached on whether Ao An was subject to the ECCC’s jurisdiction (the National Co-Investigating Judge having considered that he was not, while the International Co-Investigating Judge believed him to be one of the most responsible Khmer Rouge perpetrators). Similarly, in December 2021 the Supreme Chamber terminated the case against Meas Muth, a former naval commander, who had been charged in March 2015 
          <i>in absentia</i>
           with homicide, grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, and crimes against humanity allegedly committed at Kampong Som, Kratie, Wat Enta Nhien security centre, S-21 security centre, and against Thai, Vietnamese, other foreigners at sea, and on islands over which Democratic Kampuchea claimed sovereignty. The case was closed on the grounds that there was no enforceable indictment, again after conflicting closing orders by the Co-Investigating Judges. Also in December 2021 a case against Yim Tith, charged with perpetrating genocide against people of Khmer Krom ethnicity, crimes against humanity, grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, and violations of the 1956 Cambodian Penal Code, was terminated, sealed and archived. Proceedings against Im Chaem, a former district official, were terminated by the Court in June 2018, on the grounds that she was not subject to the ECCC’s personal jurisdiction.

                    <p id="IO-ASS.SCSL.101">In December 2013 a 16-member Residual Special Court assumed responsibility for the ongoing commitments of the Special Court for Sierra Leone, which had concluded its mandate to prosecute those `bearing the greatest responsibility for committing violations against humanitarian law’ committed in the territory of Sierra Leone since 20 November 1996. The final judgment in the case of Charles Taylor, who became the first former head of state to be found guilty of charges relating to war crimes and crimes against humanity by an international court, was issued in September 2013. The Residual Special Court, based in The Hague, was authorized to oversee witness protection and sentencing appeals. It has jurisdiction to try Maj. Johnny Paul Koroma, who, although declared dead in June 2003, remained, pending verification, an indictee of the Court charged with crimes against humanity and war crimes. The Residual Special Court maintains an office in Freetown, Sierra Leone, that provides witness and victim support. In February 2024 the Court organized a conference, in Freetown, to address its legacy.</p>

                    <p id="IO-SPEC.CRIM.COURT.CAR.4">The Special Criminal Court, comprising national and international judges, was established in June 2015 to hold accountable those guilty of grave crimes against humanity committed in the CAR since 2003 who were not already under the jurisdiction of the ICC. The Court was to work in close co-operation with the ICC. The Court’s Special Prosecutor was appointed in February 2017, and its inaugural session was held in October 2018. Preliminary investigations into 10 cases were undertaken in 2020. In May nine members of a militia grouping were arrested and brought into custody of the Court, charged with attacks against civilians in the eastern Haut-Mbomou prefecture. The Court’s first trial opened in September 2022. In its first judgment that was issued at the end of October, three members of the 3R militant grouping—Issa Sallet Adoum (also known as Bozize), Yaouba Ousman, and Mahamat Tahir—were found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity, in connection with the massacre of at least 46 civilians in May 2019 in the villages of Koundjili and Lemouna (in Lim Pendé, northwestern CAR). In July 2023 the Appeals Chamber corrected aspects of the initial judgment, including acquitting Adoum of certain charges. He was sentenced to 30 years’ imprisonment, while Ousman and Tahir received 20 year terms. Related reparations claims were meanwhile being considered. An arrest warrant was issued in February 2024 (and publicized in April) against exiled former CAR President François Bozizé Yangouvonda, in connection with crimes against humanity allegedly committed by the CAR Presidential Guard during the period February 2009-23 March 2013. The Court collaborates with the CAR’s Truth, Justice, Reparation and Reconciliation Commission.</p>
