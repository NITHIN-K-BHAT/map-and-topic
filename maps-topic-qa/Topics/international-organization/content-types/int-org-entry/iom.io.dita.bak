          <p id="IOM.CASEE.4">IOM was established in 1951, as the Intergovernmental Committee for Migration. Its predominantly operational humanitarian mandate included the handling of or­derly and planned migration, international resettlement, and facilitating the voluntary return and reintegration of migrants, refugees and internally displaced persons. The Committee's name was changed to IOM in 1989. IOM was admitted as an observer to the UN General Assembly in 1992. In June 2016 the IOM Council agreed that IOM should be incorporated into the UN system as a related organization; the new relationship was formalized at a UN Summit on Addressing Large Movements of Refugees and Migrants, held in September.</p>

          <heading>Activities</heading>
          <p>IOM aims to provide assistance to member governments in meeting the operational challenges of migration, to advance understanding of migration issues, to encourage social and economic development through migration and to work towards effective respect of the human dignity and wellbeing of migrants. It provides a full range of assistance to, and sometimes de facto protection of, migrants, refugees, internally displaced persons (IDPs) and other individuals in need of international migration services. This includes recruitment, selection, processing, medical examinations, and language and cultural orientation courses, placement, activities to facilitate reception and integration and other advisory services.</p>
          <p>
      IOM co-ordinates its refugee activities with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (
      <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-UN.1443">UNHCR</xr>
      ) and with governmental and non-governmental partners. In June 2016 the IOM Council and subsequently the UN General Assembly approved an agreement to strengthen co-operation between the two organizations by incorporating IOM into the UN system as a related body. The arrangement entered into effect in September, at the UN Summit on Addressing Large Movements of Refugees and Migrants, held at the UN General Assembly, in New York, USA. The conference adopted the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, which recognized an unprecedented level of human mobility, and determined to address the root causes of mass migration movements. It noted positive contributions made by migrants towards inclusive and sustainable development. Collective intent was declared to ensure, 
      <i>inter alia,</i>
       that refugee and migrant children receive education and are not held in detention during processing, that the rights and safety of women and girls are upheld and that countries accommodating high numbers of refugees and migrants should be supported. A commitment was made to negotiate a Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, providing a non-binding set of principles and best practices for governments, experts, civil society groups and communities at all levels of migrant movement and resettlement. The Compact, incorporating 23 objectives, was formally adopted by representatives of some 164 countries, meeting in Marrakesh, Morocco, in December 2017, and was formally endorsed on 19 December by the UN General Assembly. A UN Network on Migration was launched at the meeting, through which IOM was to undertake a lead role in co-ordinating support to member countries to implement the Global Compact. In March 2021 a UN Migration Network Hub (an online knowledge platform) was launched to support the implementation of the Global Compact.
    </p>
          <p>An inaugural quadrennial International Migration Review Forum (IMRF), representing the principal intergovernmental global platform for member states to assess the implementation of the Global Compact, was held in May 2022, in New York. During the Forum IOM pledged (i) to enable human mobility within resilient pandemic preparedness and response structures; (ii) to prevent further loss of life of migrants, and to support families left behind by migrants; (iii) to address migration and displacement in the context of disasters and the adverse effects of climate change and environmental degradation; (iv) to achieve legal identity for all; (v) to strengthen migrants’ and diaspora empowerment and contributions for development; and (vi) to scale up support to member states to conduct Migration Governance Indicator assessments (q.v.).</p>
          <p>IOM’s Strategic Plan for 2024-28 had the following strategic objectives: Saving lives and protecting people on the move; Driving solutions to displacement; and Facilitating pathways for regular migration. The following were designated as `enablers’: the IOM’s diverse and capable workforce; partnership; funding; data and evidence; learning and innovation; communication and internal systems.</p>
          <p>
      IOM’s 
      <publ-name>World Migration Report 2022,</publ-name>
       issued in December 2021, estimated that, at mid-2020, 281m. people worldwide were international migrants. In that year the principal source country for international migrants was India, followed by Mexico and the Russian Federation. The USA was the top destination country, followed by Germany.

               <heading>Migration Management</heading>
               <p>IOM’s Global Data Institute aims to support good migration governance and the implementation of relevant international frameworks. It includes a Berlin, Germany-based Global Migration Data Analysis Centre, and IOM’s Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM—developed in 2004, originally with a focus on Iraq) , which continuously monitors population displacement and movements, and has four core components: mobility tracking; flow monitoring; registration; and surveys (with a focus on return intentions, community perceptions, and displacement solutions). In November 2022, with a view to identifying root causes of fragility, a Solutions and Mobility Index was introduced, designed to track demographic and mobility trends, safety and security, access to services and infrastructure, and social cohesion. IOM has partnered with the Geneva-based Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) to advance the analysis of data on conflict and disaster-related displacement. In May 2023 the IDMC reported that nearly 61m. new internal population displacements and movements had been registered in 2022 (a record high number), and that of these 28.3m. were prompted by conflict and violence (the conflict in Ukraine significantly impacting the total).</p>
               <!--~ IDMC: 8th Global Report on Internal Displacement: v.23-->
               <p>In 2016 IOM and the UK-based Economist Intelligence Unit developed a set of 94 Migration Governance Indicators (MGIs), which aim to contribute to well-managed migration policies, and cover safe and orderly migration, a `whole-of-government’ approach to migration, migrants’ rights, partnerships, socioeconomic wellbeing, and the mobility dimensions of crises.</p>
               <p>IOM works to address the health needs of migrants and public health protection of host communities. It undertakes research and other technical support and policy development activities in the field of health care. Medical screening of prospective migrants is routinely conducted, along with immunizations and specific counselling. IOM administers programmes for disabled refugees, and extends mental health and psychosocial support. It facilitates the medical evacuations from conflict zones. In 2022 IOM supported 46 cross-border disease surveillance systems, and undertook dedicated health operations in at least 85 countries. Antiretroviral therapy was provided to 12,973 HIV patients, and TB therapy to 6,989 people. Under the organization’s malaria programming some 310,446 long-lasting insecticidal nets were supplied.</p>
               <p>Direct assistance to migrants may include the provision of shelter, food, health care, family reunification help, and income generation support. An IOM Global Assistance Fund extends emergency tailored protection support to migrants in vulnerable situations. In 2022 58 missions extended direct humanitarian protection assistance to more than 3m. people.</p>
               <p>The organization offers Assisted Voluntary Return (AVR) services to migrants who wish to repatriate voluntarily to their countries of origin. Pre-departure, transportation and post-arrival assistance is provided to unsuccessful asylum seekers, migrants in irregular situations, migrants stranded in transit, stranded students, etc. During 2022 IOM assisted 54,000 migrant voluntary returns.</p>
               <p>
        IOM works to prevent the abuse and exploitation of migrants, particularly vulnerable groups such as the elderly and unaccompanied migrant children. IOM supports the International Data Alliance for Children on the Move, launched in 2019, and comprising governments, non-governmental organizations, international and regional organizations, academics, think tanks and representatives of civil society. In May 2022 IOM and the 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-UN.1231">UN Children’s Fund</xr>
         agreed a Strategic Collaboration Framework aimed at protecting the rights of migrant children.
      </p>
               <p>
        IOM aims to counter smuggling and trafficking in migrants, and raises awareness and highlights related risks in both source and destination countries (including through a social media campaign: IOM X). The organization’s Global Data Hub on Human Trafficking provides detail on selected human trafficking cases, with a focus on principal relevant industry sectors, trafficking routes, victims’ geographical places of exploitation and origin, and forms of recruitment. IOM also works to protect trafficking victims, offering them shelter, legal and medical assistance, training, and also the options of sustainable and safe reintegration and/or voluntary return to their countries of origin, or resettlement in third countries. IOM implements Regional Programs of Protection and Assistance to Vulnerable Migrants, aimed at identifying those most at risk of exploitation, strengthening protection services, and enhancing inter-agency co-operation. The agency issues the 
        <publ-name>IOM Handbook on Direct Assistance for Victims of Trafficking</publ-name>
        .
      </p>
               <p>In March 2013 IOM and the International Commission on Missing Persons concluded a co-operation agreement. IOM’s Missing Migrants Project was established in October of that year. The Project estimated that at least 8,541 migrants died in transit during 2023. Total known migrant transit deaths during the period 2014-March 2024 amounted to more than 64,240.</p>
               <p usage="mena">In June 2023 IOM reported that during 2022 almost 3,800 people had died on migration routes within and from the Middle East and North Africa region.</p>
               <p>IOM extends immigration and border governance support to governments aimed at strengthening relevant policy, legislation, administrative structures and operational systems. IOM undertakes national border assessments to identify areas for development, and on request may formulate a Capacity Building in Migration Management (CBMM) programme. These may incorporate a specific training scheme for immigration and border control officials. Throughout these activities, IOM aims to maintain an emphasis on the rights and wellbeing of migrants, and in particular to ensure that the specific needs of migrant women are incorporated into programmes and policies.</p>
               <p>In addition, IOM supports the issuance of reliable, secure identity documents and the implementation of new developments in identity recognition and management (such as the responsible use of biometric identification). The agency has developed its own Migration Information and Data Analysis System (MIDAS). IOM maintains data on citizenship and migration, including on variations in national legislation relating to citizenship status and voting rights, on rules governing naturalization, and on dual nationality.</p>
               <p>IOM provides assistance to facilitate migration under organized and regular migration schemes. These are tailored to address specific programme needs and cover the different phases of the migration process: information and application, interview and approval, and post-approval (including pre-departure counselling and cultural orientation).</p>
               <p>IOM formulates policy and operational guidance in matters related to labour mobility, the integration of migrants, and diaspora communities. The agency places a strategic focus on fostering a deeper understanding of the linkages between migration and development; and on enhancing the benefits that well-managed migration can have for the development, growth and prosperity of migrants' countries of origin and of destination, as well as for the migrants personally. IOM's activities in this area include strengthening the capacity of governments and other stakeholders to engage expatriate migrant communities in development processes in their countries of origin; promoting economic and community development in places from which there is a high level of emigration; enhancing the development impact of remittances (i.e. funds returned voluntarily to their home countries by migrant workers, mainly in the form of private money transfers); and facilitating the return and reintegration of qualified nationals. In October 2018 IOM launched iDiaspora, an online platform to connect diaspora communities around the world and to highlight and foster their influence. In April 2022 the agency co-hosted the second Global Diaspora Summit, in the Irish capital, Dublin. Remittances sent to low- and middle-income countries globally were estimated at US&#8201;$647,000m. in 2022.</p>
               <p>An IOM Institutional Strategy on Migration, Environment and Climate Change was being undertaken during 2021-30. IOM recognizes a direct link between migration (cross-border and internal) and both climate change and environmental degradation (termed environmental migration), and notes that increasing numbers of migrants are moving from rural to densely populated urban environments, which are at particular risk from the adverse impacts of climate change. An IOM Environmental Migration Portal is maintained. IOM addresses the root causes of complex migration crises and drivers of migration, and focuses on empowering migrants and displaced people and on fostering sustainable transitions from emergency relief to recovery and inclusive development, and establishing peaceful, inclusive and resilient societies. An IOM Institutional Strategy on Migration and Sustainable Development, initiated in 2020, aimed to support the attainment of the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>
               <p>In January 2019 IOM introduced a Joint Global Initiative on Diversity, Inclusion and Social Cohesion (DISC Initiative), which aims to enhance IOM’s capacity to support member states and partner agencies to strengthen social cohesion and the integration and inclusion of migrants. In March 2023 the organization initiated an `I am a Migrant’ campaign, aimed at combating xenophobia and promoting diversity and inclusion.</p>
               <p>The IOM Development Fund, which had a budget of US&#8201;$15m. in 2024, supports developing member states and member states with economies in transition with the implementation of migration management capacity-building projects.</p>

               <p>IOM maintains a Migration Data Portal, with thematic focus (in 2024) on migration policy; migration and development (including diasporas and remittances); migration and vulnerability (including disability and human mobility, migrant health, smuggling of migrants, and migrant deaths and disappearances); various types of migration (for example, mixed migration, irregular migration: occurring outside regulatory norms, environmental migration, urbanization trends, international students, and return migration); and immigration and emigration statistics (including on gender and on `international migrant stocks’: i.e. the total international migrant presence in individual countries). The third International Forum on Migration Statistics was convened in January 2023, in Santiago, Chile.

               <p>IOM was a founder member of the inter-agency Global Migration Group (GMG, established as the Geneva Migration Group in April 2003 and renamed in 2006). The GMG provides a framework for discussion among the heads of member organizations on the application of decisions and norms relating to migration, and for stronger leadership in addressing related issues. IOM has since 2001 invited its members, with representatives of international and non-governmental organizations, civil society and the private sector, and academics to participate in regular International Dialogue on Migration (IDM). The focus of the 2023 IDM, which was convened over two sessions held in March and October, was `Leveraging Human Mobility in Support of the SDGs’.</p>
               <p>IOM provides technical, research and capacity-building support and policy guidance to Inter-State Consultation Mechanisms on migration (ISCM), which include global processes on migration, Regional Consultative Processes (RCPs) on migration, and Inter-Regional Forums (IRFs) on migration. A regular co-ordinating Meeting of Global and (Inter) Regional Consultative Processes on migration (GRCP) is convened, under IOM auspices: the 10th GRCP was held in June 2023, in Geneva.</p>

               <p>In emergency situations IOM provides transportation and human­itarian assistance to individuals requiring evacuation, as well as providing support to countries of temporary protection. IOM supports IDPs through the provision of emergency shelter and relief materials. Post-emergency movement assistance for returning displaced populations is also provided (mainly IDPs, demobilized soldiers and persons affected by natural disasters). In post-crisis situations the agency actively supports governments in the reconstruction and rehabilitation of affected communities and offers short-term community and micro-enterprise development programmes. Within the UN’s inter-agency `Cluster Approach’ to organizing humanitarian assistance, IOM is the designated lead on Camp Co-ordination and Management in natural disaster situations (UNHCR leads that cluster in conflict situations).</p>
               <p>IOM provides services to assist with the resettlement of individuals accepted under regular national immigration programmes. These include supporting the processing of relevant documentation; medical screening; arranging safe transportation; and, in some cases, the provision of language training and cultural orientation. IOM also assists with the voluntary repatriation of refugees, mainly in support of UNHCR’s voluntary repatriation activities.</p>
               <p>In January 2024 IOM issued its first consolidated Global Appeal, for US $7,900m., to support 139.4m. people worldwide. Some $3,400m. was requested to fund activities relating to the strategic objective Saving lives and protecting people on the move; $2,700m. for Driving solutions to displacement; and $1,600m. for Facilitating pathways for regular migration.</p>

                    <p usage="ewyb edio">IOM has maintained an uninterrupted operational presence in Afghanistan since 1992. During 2024 IOM was undertaking a US&#8201;$556m. operation in that country, prioritizing the meaningful participation of women. Some $326m. in donor contributions was requested under the 2024 Global Appeal. Cross-border and post-arrival humanitarian assistance was to be extended to vulnerable undocumented Afghan migrants at four main border entry points with Iran and Pakistan. Protection and camp co-ordination and camp management services were to be provided, emergency shelter supplied, non-food items and personal hygiene kits dispensed, and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) initiatives undertaken. IOM was also to implement life-saving migration health interventions, and to offer psychosocial support. Disaster preparedness activities were to be implemented in high-risk communities. At the Cox’s Bazar network of camps in Bangladesh IOM and partners have worked to provide nearly 1m. Rohingya Muslim refugees from Myanmar with shelter; primary and emergency health care; nutritional assistance; and WASH facilities (including by installing emergency latrines, decentralized wastewater treatment systems, earthen dams, and by boring wells). The agency has also provided camp management services, worked to improve local infrastructure, sourced alternative fuel sources for cooking, extended skills development support to migrants, facilitated Women’s and Girl’s Safe Spaces, and offered support to victims of gender-based violence, as well as seeking to combat the potential trafficking of vulnerable refugees. It maintains a Rohingya Cultural Memory Centre. An IOM-managed Bamboo Treatment Facility processes bamboo poles that are used in shelter construction. In March 2024 the IOM appealed for $119m. to fund its activities in Bangladesh under the inter-agency Joint Response Plan for the Rohingya Humanitarian Crisis.</p>

                    <p>An IOM-UNHCR-led regional Refugee and Migrant Response Plan (RMRP) for 2023-24 aimed to assist, through protection, humanitarian, and socioeconomic integration activities, around 3.4m. people, including migrants in transit, those making pendular movements between Venezuela and Colombia, Colombian returnees, and members of host communities receiving Venezuelan refugees. During 2024 the RMRP required funding from the international community totalling US&#8201;$1,587m.</p>
                    <p>IOM, in co-ordination with UNHCR and partner agencies has monitored the situation of large mixed migration flows (`caravans’) of migrants from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador aiming to reach the Mexico-USA border. (It has been reported that such mass mobilizations ensure greater security and visibility for migrants along potentially dangerous routes.) The agency has helped provide the migrants with basic support, including food, hygiene kits and, where required, voluntary returns assistance. IOM’s Regional Strategy for North America, Central America and the Caribbean, covering the period 2020-24, focused on addressing adverse factors that were driving migration; facilitating safe, regular and orderly forms of migration; and effective advocacy for migrants. A notable rise in the use by migrants in the region of informal border crossings and dangerous routes was observed in 2022. Of nearly 250,000 migrants who were reported to have transited across the hazardous Darien jungle in the Colombia-Panama border zone in 2022—almost double the number of crossings made in 2021—150,327 were Venezuelans. The Missing Migrants Project recorded that 9,260 migrants had gone missing en route to the southern US border during the period 2014-March 2024.</p>
                    <p>During 2022-24 IOM and partners were implementing a US&#160;$317m. Haiti Crisis Response Plan, targeting 1.1m. beneficiaries, with a focus on tackling the root causes of irregular migration, building community resilience to identified risks and reducing forced population flows, mainstreaming migration issues into the development agenda, and improving the capacities of national institutions to manage migration dynamics. In February 2024 IOM reported that more than 362,000 people were displaced within Haiti as a consequence of gang violence, and that around 9,000 people had recently been forced to return to Haiti from nearby Dominican Republic.</p>

                    <p>In 2023 IOM recorded 292,985 irregular arrivals in Europe: Italy received 157,651 seaborne migrants, Greece 41,561, and the Canary Islands (Spain) 39,910. IOM has assisted the voluntary relocation of migrants from Italy to other EU member states. The agency estimated that during 2014-July 2023, of all migrants who had attempted to cross to Europe on the Mediterranean route, 1% (27,629 migrants, including 21,972 on the particularly dangerous central Mediterranean migrant corridor between North Africa and Italy) had died or disappeared, 29% had been intercepted, and 70% had become irregular arrivals in Europe. In mid-June 2023 at least 500 migrants were believed to have drowned when a very overcrowded vessel—reportedly en route from Tobruk (Libya) to Italy, and carrying mainly people from Pakistan, Syria and Egypt—capsized off the coast of Greece; IOM and UNHCR jointly extended assistance to survivors and emphasized the international legal duty promptly to rescue people in distress at sea. In recent years the Western Balkans have became a major transit route for migrants aiming to reach Western Europe. The third Sarajevo Migration Dialogue, organized with IOM support in June 2023, in Jahorina, Bosnia and Herzegovina, adopted an Action Plan for Sustainable Migration Governance in the Western Balkans, covering the period 2023-25. A Bosnia and Herzegovina Crisis Response Plan 2024 required funding of US&#8201;$31m., and aimed to support migrants and asylum seekers transiting through that country. A $12m. Armenia Crisis Response Plan 2024 aimed to support more than 100,000 ethnic Armenians who had fled to Armenia from Nagornyi Karabakh in September-October 2023.</p>
                    <p>IOM has aimed to support the significant numbers of people displaced by the conflict in Ukraine, as well as former combatants, international migrants, refugees, members of affected communities and third party nationals within Ukraine and in nearby countries, including through facilitating access to quality services, and initiating early recovery activities. As at December 2023 IOM recorded 3.7m. IDPs, mainly from the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions, while most returnees were located in and around Kyiv (the national capital). In March 2024 IOM launched a US $1,500m. Strategic Response Plan: Ukraine and Neighbouring Countries (2024-26). Some $370m. was required in Ukraine in 2024, and $154m. in neighbouring countries. Through the DTM, IOM has conducted surveys across conflict-affected Ukraine and in nearby Belarus, Hungary, Moldova, Poland, Romania and Slovakia, to inform evidence-based humanitarian actions and policy.</p>

                    <p>IOM has maintained a mission in Yemen and an office in Sana’a, that country’s capital, since 2007. IOM’s Yemen Crisis Response Plan 2024 required US&#8201;$162m. to support 2.1m. beneficiaries, through the extension of multisectoral humanitarian assistance, specialized protection assistance, and support to enable crisis-affected communities to transition towards recovery. The Lebanon Crisis Response Plan 2024, requiring $31m., aimed to support some 123,000 very vulnerable migrants, refugees and members of local communities, and had a focus on building economic and community resilience and discouraging irregular migration. IOM was implementing a $145m. initiative during 2024 to support 670,000 IDPs, migrants, returnees and host communities in Iraq. Since the start of civil conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic in 2011 IOM has provided emergency relief to migrants and uprooted IDPs within that country (at a projected cost of $90m. in 2024).</p>
                    <p>In February 2023 IOM appealed for US $161m. to provide emergency assistance to 800,000 earthquake survivors in southern Türkiye and 630,000 in northwestern Syria. A $295m. Türkiye Crisis Response Plan 2024 had 1.7m. beneficiaries.</p>
                    <p usage="edio">Following the massive escalation of Islamist-Israeli conflict in October 2023 IOM’s Director-General expressed grave concern at the mass displacement of civilians within Gaza. She reiterated appeals by other UN agencies that an immediate ceasefire be implemented in order to distribute essential humanitarian supplies to some 1.9m. vulnerable people in urgent need.</p>
                    <p>IOM and UNHCR jointly lead the UN component of an African Union (AU)-EU-UN Tripartite Taskforce on the Situation of Migrants and Refugees in Libya (operational since early 2022). Meeting in March 2023 the Taskforce determined to strengthen efforts to support the development of non-discriminatory legal and policy frameworks for migrants and refugees in that country, and urged the Libyan authorities to end arbitrary detention of migrants and refugees. The Taskforce agreed to enhance support for voluntary humanitarian returns from Libya. IOM was implementing a US&#8201;$100m. Libya Crisis Response Plan during 2024.</p>
                    <p>Under a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding that was concluded in July 2023 between the EU and Tunisia—a favoured point of departure for migrants aiming to reach Italy—the EU was to extend budgetary support to Tunisia, and was to focus investment there on areas that included migration management (with an initial €105m. designated to combating people smuggling, prioritizing the local activities of IOM and UNHCR, and the provision of patrol vehicles and equipment). During two days alone in mid-September some 8,000 migrants who had departed from Tunisia landed on the Italian island of Lampedusa, which lies around 113 km from the Tunisian coast and 205 km from Sicily.</p>

          In 2024 IOM required funding of US&#8201;$88m. to support nearly 1m. international migrants and members of local host communities in the framework of a Migrant Response Plan for the Horn of Africa, Yemen and Southern Africa. IOM’s South Sudan Crisis Response Plan 2024 aimed, at a cost of $172m., to assist 1.8m. beneficiaries through the provision life-saving assistance and by developing conducive environments to promote sustainable returns and recovery. In 2024—under its Response plan for the complex migrant and refugee crisis in and around Sudan, that had arisen following an outbreak of violent conflict in that country in April 2023—IOM required funding of $162m. to support IDP
          
          s and refugees within Sudan, and $146m. to assist Sudanese and third country migrants and asylum seekers in neighbouring countries: Chad (hosting 37% of new arrivals from Sudan as at January 2024), South Sudan (30%), Egypt (24%). as well as Central African Republic (CAR), Ethiopia, and Libya. Host communities were also to be aided. In January 2024 IOM reported that the conflict in Sudan had displaced in total 10.7m. people. (of whom 9m. were IDPs, and 1.7m. had fled the country). Both within Sudan and in neighbouring countries IOM was providing essential protection and health care services, emergency shelter and relief items, cash-based support, provision of clean water and hygiene kits, and critical onward transportation. In January 2024 IOM reported that the conflict in Sudan had uprooted in total 10.7m. people. (of whom 9m. were IDPs, and 1.7m. had fled the country). In 2024 IOM was also implementing crisis response plans in Somalia (requiring $226m.), Ethiopia ($212m.), Democratic Republic of the Congo ($191m.), Niger ($130m.), Chad ($116m.), Nigeria ($101m.), Burundi ($68m.), CAR ($36m.), Kenya ($30m.), Mali ($25m.), Cameroon ($19m.), and Burkina Faso ($13m.).
