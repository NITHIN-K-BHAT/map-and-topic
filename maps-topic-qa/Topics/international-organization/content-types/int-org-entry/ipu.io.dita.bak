        The Assembly is the main statutory body of the IPU, comprising eight to 10 representatives from each member parliament. It meets twice a year to discuss current issues in world affairs and to make political recommendations on parliamentary action. Other specialized meetings of parliamentarians may also be held, on a global or regional basis. The Assembly is assisted by the four plenary Standing Committees: on Peace and International Security; Sustainable Development, Finance and Trade; Democracy and Human Rights; and on United Nations (UN) Affairs. The

               <p>The Governing Council consists of delegations normally comprising three representatives of each member parliament—provided that women and men are represented in the delegation. In accordance with reforms adopted in October 2019 by the 141st Assembly, single-sex delegations are also permitted but are restricted to one representative, and thus have reduced voting rights. The Council is responsible for approving membership and the annual programme and budget of the IPU, and for electing the Secretary-General. The Council may consider substantive issues and adopt resolutions and policy statements, in particular on the basis of recommendations from its sub­sid­iary bodies. It normally meets at the same time as the Assembly. The following bodies are subsidiary to the Governing Council: the Committee on the Human Rights of Parliamentarians; Committee on Middle East Questions; Group of Facilitators for Cyprus; Committee to Promote Respect for International Human­itarian Law (IHL); Advisory Group on Health; High-level Advisory Group on Countering Terrorism and Violent Extremism; a Forum of Women Parliamentarians (which elects a co-ordinating Bureau of Women Parliamentarians); a Forum of Young Parliamentarians (which elects a governing Board); and a Working Group on Science and Technology. Six geopolitical groupings—the African, Arab, Asia-Pacific and Eurasia groups, `Twelve-Plus’ (comprising Australia, Canada and the remainder of Europe) and GRULAC (the Group of Latin America and the Caribbean)—co-ordinate regional participation within the IPU framework.</p>

          <p>An IPU Strategy to guide the organization’s activities during 2022-26 was adopted by the Governing Council in November 2021. It aimed to support the development of parliamentary ecosystems for democracy, for everyone, incorporating many of the experiences and lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic. The main strategic objectives were: Building effective and empowered parliaments; Promoting inclusive and representative parliaments; Supporting resilient and innovative parliaments; Catalysing collective parliamentary action; and Strengthening the IPU’s accountability. The priority areas of action were identified as climate change; democracy, human rights, gender equality and youth participation; peace and security; and sustainable development for all.</p>

               <p>The IPU pursues a strategic partnership with the UN, incorporating a parliamentary voice into global decision-making processes. Co-operation between the IPU, the UN and national parliaments is renewed on a biennial basis through a series of resolutions of the UN General Assembly. The IPU’s Committee on UN Affairs also aims to expand understanding of UN processes. The IPU co-operates with programmes and agencies of the UN, in particular in the preparation and follow-up of major socioeconomic conferences. An IPU-UN Annual Parliamentary Hearing is convened every February: in 2024 this was titled `Putting an end to conflicts: Prescriptions for a peaceful future’.</p>
               <p>A `P20’ Parliamentary Speakers’ Summit is convened annually by parliamentarians from the Group of 20 industrialized and developing economies (2023: in New Delhi, India, in October). The IPU and the European Parliament jointly organize an annual parliamentary conference on the World Trade Organization (WTO), which addresses issues including access to markets, the development dimension of the multilateral trading system, agriculture and subsidies. The conference aims to add a parliamentary dimension to multilateral co-operation on trade matters and thereby to enhance the transparency of the WTO’s activities and to strengthen democracy at international level.</p>

        The IPU sets standards and guidelines based on the collective expertise of member parliaments. A fundamental Universal Declaration on Democracy was adopted by IPU member parliaments in September 1997. The organization works to mobilize international support to advance the capabilities, infrastructure and technical facilities of national parliaments, with a focus on promoting human rights and the protection of parliamentarians, supporting gender equality, ethnic diversity, and parliamentary action to combat corruption, and safeguarding accessible, transparent, accountable and effective national representation. The IPU has developed a Indicators for Democratic Parliaments self-assessment toolkit that enables parliaments to evaluate their own performance, as well as specialized self-assessment toolkits that address human rights, disaster risk reduction, gender sensitivity, and parliamentary effectiveness in implementing the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In October 2014 the IPU Governing Council adopted a series of Common Principles for Support to Parliaments; these had by February 2024 been endorsed by 147 national parliaments, 10 parliamentary assemblies and 21 partner agencies. An IPU Centre on Innovation in Parliament—comprising a series of regional and thematic hubs—was inaugurated in December 2018, and offers parliaments a platform for developing and sharing digital strategies and good practices. A 
        <publ-name>Guide to digital transformation in parliaments</publ-name>
         was issued in October 2023. The IPU maintains IPU Parline: a database that covers the structure and functioning of all parliaments, and includes data on national elections, women’s parliamentary representation, and on national parliamentary specialized bodies addressing human rights, gender equality, and women’s caucuses.
      </p>
               <p>
        The IPU and the UN Development Programme (UNDP) concluded a comprehensive Memorandum of Understanding in November 2007 aimed at expanding mutual co-operation in support of worldwide democratic governance. Both organizations periodically jointly issue a 
        <publ-name>Global Parliamentary Report</publ-name>
        ; the third edition, published in May 2022, was focused on public engagement in the work of parliaments.

        The IPU has reported on the rights and responsibilities of election observers and issued guidelines on the holding of free and fair elections. These include the 1994 Declaration on Criteria for Free and Fair Elections, a study entitled 
        <publ-name>Free and Fair Elections</publ-name>
         (initially published in 1994, and issued in a revised expanded version in 2006),

        The 128th IPU Assembly in March 2013 adopted a resolution addressing the use of media (including social media) in enhancing citizen engagement and democracy. In October 2015 the 133rd Assembly adopted a resolution on Democracy in the Digital Era and the Threat to Privacy and Individual Freedoms. The Union issued a 
        <publ-name>Social Media Guide for Parliaments and Parliamentarians</publ-name>
         in February 2021. A session of the periodic IPU-supported World e-Parliament Conference was held in June. An updated edition of the IPU’s 
        <publ-name>World e-Parliament Report, </publ-name>
         released in January 2023, focused on the acceleration of digital transformation in parliaments that had been prompted by the COVID-19 crisis. During the pandemic more than one-half of parliaments were reported to have held a virtual plenary gathering, and more than three-quarters had organized virtual committee meetings.

               <heading>Human Rights</heading>
               <p>The IPU’s Human Rights Programme aims to incorporate human rights concerns in all areas of activity. A 10-member Committee on the Human Rights of Parliamentarians is responsible for the consideration of complaints relating to alleged violations of the human rights of members of parliament, for example violation of freedom of expression, undue suspension and loss of parliamentary mandate, and threats and acts of intimidation (the three most prevalent violations during 2023), as well as lack of fair trial, state harassment, intimidation, arbitrary arrest and detention, violation of parliamentary immunity, torture and assassination. The Committee mobilizes the international parliamentary community to support threatened parliamentarians, visits MPs in danger, lobbies national authorities, and sends representatives to observe parliamentarians’ trials. In December 2023 the IPU warned that at least 762 parliamentarians from 47 states worldwide were under threat. The Committee conducts hearings and fact-finding site missions, and observes trials, to investigate and seek to resolve a complaint. In 2023 it issued reports on trials of parliamentarians that had been observed in Pakistan and Zimbabwe, and on a fact-finding mission that had been undertaken to Iraq during August. Usually the Committee meets three times a year—twice at each of the biannual IPU Assemblies, and for a third time away from the Assemblies. Decisions taken by the Committee recommending remedial measures in relation to specific cases are presented to the Governing Council for endorsement. In October 2023 the Governing Council adopted recommendations presented by the Committee that concerned 15 situations relating to the alleged violations of the human rights of parliamentarians in nine countries or territories: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eswatini, Iraq, Myanmar, Pakistan, the Philippines, Senegal, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe.</p>
               <p>
        The IPU works closely with the International Committee of the Red Cross to uphold respect for International Humanitarian Law (IHL), and supports the implementation of relevant international and national legis­lation. In June 2020 a revised 
        <publ-name>ICRC-IPU Handbook on IHL</publ-name>
         was issued (the first edition having been published in 1999).

               <p>In March 2018 the 138th IPU Assembly issued a declaration that emphasized the pivotal role of parliaments in translating the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration and Global Compact on Refugees (both of which were adopted by governments later in the year) into national legislation. The declaration stressed the contribution made by correctly managed migration to wider prosperity and wellbeing.</p>
               <p>
        In April 2012 the Assembly adopted a resolution on Access to Health as a Basic Right: the Role of Parliaments in Addressing Challenges to Securing the Health of Women and Children. The 141st Assembly, convened in October 2019, adopted a landmark resolution in support of the UN-backed objective of achieving universal health coverage (UHC) by 2030. The 143rd IPU Assembly, held in November 2021, issued a unanimous emergency resolution that recognized extensive COVID-19 immunization as a `global public good’, and called for `timely, equitable and universal access to safe, affordable, quality and effective vaccines’ to combat the coronavirus pandemic. In December 2022 IPU and the World Health Organization jointly issued

        The IPU aims to promote conflict resolution and international security through political discussion. The Union supports UN Resolutions 1325 and 2250, which focus on peace and security in relation to women and youth, respectively. In April 2015 the 132nd IPU Assembly adopted an emergency resolution that strongly condemned all acts of terrorism, while emphasizing the rights of civilians, and in particular of women and girls, in countries threatened by extremist organizations. Parliaments were urged to adopt a common strategy on countering extremist propaganda and with regard to the cyber-recruitment of combatants. The 132nd Assembly also adopted a resolution that strongly condemned the deliberate destruction and systematic looting of cultural property by terrorist groupings. In March 2016 the 134th Assembly adopted a resolution on peace and international security, which emphasized the need for a multifaceted collective approach to combating hatred, eliminating terrorist networks, and counteracting terrorist propaganda, and recommended nearly 30 related points of action for legislatures. The 141st Assembly, held in October 2019, endorsed a declaration on `Strengthening international law: Parliamentary roles and mechanisms, and the contribution of regional co-operation’. In February 2022 the IPU, with the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism, and 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="UNODA.IO">UN Office on Drugs and Crime</xr>
        , issued model legislative provisions aimed at protecting the rights of victims of terrorism. In March 2023 the 146th Assembly adopted the Manama Declaration on Promoting peaceful coexistence and inclusive societies: Fighting intolerance, and a resolution on Cybercrimes: The new risks to global security.
      </p>
               <p>The IPU has worked constantly to promote international and regional efforts towards disarmament, as part of the process of enhancing peace and security. It promotes UN Resolution 1540 on preventing non-state actors from acquiring weapons of mass destruction, and supports the organization Parliamentarians for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament. In March 2014 the 130th IPU Assembly issued a Resolution titled Towards a Nuclear-Weapon-Free World.</p>
               <p>Following the Russian Federation’s military invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 the IPU Executive Committee strongly condemned Russia’s violation of Ukraine’s territorial integrity, sovereignty, and internationally recognized borders, and attack on democracy, freedom, peace and security, and on the rule of law. The IPU expressed solidarity with the people of Ukraine and with the parliamentarians of its unicameral Verkhovna Rada (legislature). In March the 144th IPU Assembly called for full compliance with the rules of IHL; encouraged member states to provide humanitarian aid to Ukraine, and for all parties to establish humanitarian corridors; and urged the IPU to use its good offices to promote dialogue between parliamentarians in Russia and Ukraine. An IPU Task Force on Ukraine was established in April. In October the 145th Assembly adopted a resolution titled `Condemnation of the invasion of Ukraine and of the subsequent annexation of territories, in defence of the territorial integrity of all states’.</p>

In November 2019 the IPU released a comprehensive set of guidelines aimed at eliminating sexual harassment and violence against women in parliaments. The promotion of gender equality and gender sensitive parliaments was the subject of a special resolution adopted by the Assembly in October 2022. An updated handbook for parliamentarians on the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and its Optional Protocol was released in June 2023 jointly by the Union and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p>
               <p>The IPU compiles statistical data (regularly updated in Parline) on female representation in national parliaments—demonstrating progress made in this area since the 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women. According to the IPU, at mid-2023 the global average of female representation in all legislatures was 26.6%, compared with 11.3% in 1995. At regional level the Americas had the highest level of female representation in legislatures (averaging 34.8% across the continent: with female representation strongest in the Caribbean, averaging 39.6%, and in North America, at 38.7%); followed by Europe (averaging 31.0%: strongest in the Nordic countries, at 45.8%); sub-Saharan Africa (26.9%); Asia (21.3%); the Pacific region (22.8%: averaging 46.4% across Australia and New Zealand, but only 6.7% across the Pacific Islands); and the Middle East and North Africa (16.3%). At 1 February 2024, of lower or else single legislative chambers globally, women held the highest proportion of seats in Rwanda (61.3%), followed by Cuba (55.7%). IPU reported at the time that, across bicameral and unicameral national parliaments, women speakers presided over 23.7% of all chambers, globally. (There were no women speakers in the Middle East and North Africa, and only two in the Pacific region.) The IPU issues regular studies on historical trends, and comparative analyses on women’s representation in parliament.</p>
               <p>The IPU, jointly with UNDP, UN Women and other partners, maintains the International Knowledge Network of Women in Politics (iKNOW Politics), which, since March 2007, has aimed to advance female political participation.</p>

               <p>The 122nd IPU Assembly (2010) adopted, by consensus, a resolution on Youth Participation in the Democratic Process. The IPU reported in October 2023 that only 32.1% of parliamentarians worldwide were under the age of 45 and only 2.8% of parliamentarians were aged under 30. The Ninth IPU Global Conference of Young Parliamentarians, convened in September of that year, in Hanoi, Viet Nam, addressed the theme: `The role of youth in accelerating the achievement of the SDGs through digital transformation and innovation’. A Forum of Young Parliamentarians, established in 2013 to promote youth participation in activities of the organization and in national parliaments, meets at each IPU Assembly.</p>
