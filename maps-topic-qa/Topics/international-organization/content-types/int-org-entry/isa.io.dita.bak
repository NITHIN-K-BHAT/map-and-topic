          <heading>Activities</heading>
          <p>In July 2019 the Assembly adopted an ISA Strategic Plan for 2019-23 (extended until 2025 by a decision of the Assembly in July 2023). The Plan had the following nine strategic directions: (i) realizing ISA’s role in a global context; (ii) strengthening the regulatory framework for activities in the Area; (iii) protecting the marine environment; (iv) promoting marine scientific research in the Area; (v) building capacity for member states; (vi) ensuring integrated participation by developing states; (vii) ensuring equitable sharing of financial and other economic benefits; (viii) improving ISA’s organizational performance; and (ix) committing to transparency. In December 2020 the Assembly formally endorsed a programmatic approach to strategic direction (v) on capacity development, and in this regard requested the Secretary-General to prepare a dedicated strategy, with a particular focus on geographically disadvantaged states, landlocked developing countries, small island developing states, and least developed countries. </p>
          <p>ISA developed a Marine Scientific Research Action Plan as a framework for its contribution to the 2021-30 UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development. The Action Plan had the following strategic priorities: advancing scientific knowledge and understanding of deep sea ecosystems in the Area; standardizing and innovating methodologies for deep sea biodiversity assessment, including taxonomic identification and description, in the Area; facilitating technology development for activities in the Area, including ocean observation and monitoring; enhancing scientific knowledge and understanding of potential impacts of activities in the Area; promoting the dissemination and exchange of scientific data and deep sea research outputs; and strengthening the deep sea scientific capacity of (in particular, developing) ISA member states.</p>
          <p>The original Part XI of the Convention, concerning the exploitation of the international ocean bed, and particularly the minerals to be found there—such as cobalt, copper, manganese and nickel, envisaged as the `common heritage of mankind'—had not been supported by the USA and other industrialized nations on the grounds that countries possessing adequate technology for deep sea mining would be insufficiently represented in ISA; that the operations of private mining consortia would be unacceptably limited by the stipulations that their techno­logy should be shared with the Authority's `Enterprise'; and that production should be limited. Under an Agreement Relating to the Implementation of Part XI of the Convention, adopted by the UN General Assembly in July 1994, there was to be no mandatory transfer of technology, the Enterprise was to operate according to commercial principles, and there were to be no production limits, although a compensation fund was to assist land-based producers adversely affected by seabed mining. At January 2024 there were 152 states parties to the 1994 Agreement.</p>

               <heading>Mining Code</heading>
               <p>
        The comprehensive set of rules, regulations and procedures being developed by ISA to govern prospecting, exploration and exploitation of marine resources (and issued within the general legal framework set out by
        <xr pageref="N" ref="UNCLOS.IO.1">UNCLOS</xr>
        ) is known as the Mining Code. The Code comprises Regulations for Prospecting and Exploration for Polymetallic Nodules in the Area, adopted by the Authority in July 2000 (and updated by an Annex endorsed in July 2013); Regulations for Prospecting and Exploration for Polymetallic Sulphides, adopted in May 2010; and Regulations on Prospecting and Exploration for Cobalt-rich Ferromanganese Crusts in the Area, adopted in July 2012. In 2014 ISA initiated the process of formulating regulations and procedures to govern the exploitation of mineral resources found in the Area—to be based on a balance between securing economic advantage and protecting the environment. The process was intensified following Nauru’s notification to ISA on 25 June 2021—initiating a two-year notice period, as required under UNCLOS—that the state-sponsored Nauru Ocean Resources Inc. (a subsidiary of a Canadian enterprise) intended to submit an application to initiate (lucrative) commercial deep seeing mining activities in the North Pacific Ocean’s Clarion-Clipperton Fracture Zone (CCZ). A draft roadmap to guide regulation of the deep sea mining process was developed by the Legal and Technical Commission in 2022, and subsequently revised. In July 2023 the Assembly decided to begin accepting and filing commercial applications for deep sea mining permits. Agreement on finalizing the regulatory Mining Code was not, however, reached, amid great controversy—with the 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-UN.1190">UN High Commissioner for Human Rights</xr>
        , many global financial institutions, some states, environmentalists, scientists, and other stakeholders advocating for a moratorium on deep sea mining in view of its potential environmental repercussions
        
        . The Assembly determined that formal discussions focused on the protection of the marine environment would be organized in 2024.

        ISA sets international regulations and procedures that aim to defend the health and biodiversity of the natural marine environment in the Area. An agreement on the implementation of the provisions of 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="UNCLOS.IO.1">UNCLOS</xr>
         relating to the conservation and management of straddling and highly migratory fish stocks was opened for signature in December 1995 and entered into force in December 2001; by January 2024 it had 93 states parties. ISA aims to develop a Framework for Regional Environmental Management Plans, to assist relevant organs of the Authority, contractors and their sponsoring states. An Environmental Management Plan for the CCZ was adopted in 2012.
      </p>
               <p>In June 2017 ISA, participating in the UN Conference to Support Implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14 (the `UN Ocean Conference’), registered seven voluntary commitments towards the implementation of Goal 14: `Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources’. A second UN Ocean Conference that was co-hosted by Portugal and Kenya in late June-early July 2022, in the Portuguese capital Lisbon, adopted the Lisbon Declaration on `Our ocean, our future, our responsibility’, which incorporated further ocean-related voluntary commitments, including on combating plastic pollution. In December a roadmap was finalized to guide, until 2025, an ISA Sustainable Seabed Knowledge Initiative that had been launched in July 2022 by ISA, the European Commission and other partners.</p>

        Pursuant to the Regulations for Prospecting and Exploration for Polymetallic Nodules in the Area, by February 2024 some 31 15-year deep sea exploration contracts (i.e. governing exploration beyond national jurisdictions) had been signed by ISA and registered pioneer investors; of these contracts, 19 related to exploration for polymetallic nodules (17 in the CCZ, one in the Central Indian Ocean Basin, and one in the Western Pacific Ocean); seven related to exploration for polymetallic sulphides in the South West Indian Ridge, Central Indian Ridge and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge; and five to exploration for cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts in the Western Pacific Ocean. In accordance with a provision of 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="UNCLOS.IO.1">UNCLOS</xr>
         access to deep-sea mineral resources in so-called `reserved areas’ of the international seabed is set aside for entities from developing countries. The sixth annual gathering of associated exploration contractors was convened by ISA’s secretariat in October 2023, in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
