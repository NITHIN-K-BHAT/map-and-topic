        The Bank's unit of account is the Islamic Dinar (ID), which is equivalent to the value of one Special Drawing Right (SDR) of the International Monetary Fund. 
        
        (The value of the SDR averaged US&#8201;$1.33403 in 2023.) In 2016 the Bank introduced the solar year, i.e. corresponding to 1 January-31 December, as the basis of its accounting series; prior to that its reports refer to the lunar year (`Hirja’: 
        <sc>h</sc>
        ). The Bank’s authorized capital is ID&#8201;100,000m. In December 2020 the Board of Governors approved a 6th General Capital Increase, raising subscribed capital by ID&#8201;5,500m. to ID&#8201;55,500m. At 31 December 2022 total committed subscriptions amounted to ID&#8201;55,256.7m.

          <p>The Bank provides interest-free loans—adhering to the Islamic principle that forbids usury. Particular areas of focus are the alleviation of poverty, and support for improved governance, sustainable urban and agricultural development, related energy and transport infrastructures, education, healthcare services, humanitarian relief, and advancing the opportunities of women and girls, with the wider aim of accelerating progress towards the attainment in member states of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs, being implemented globally during 2015-30). The IsDB promotes transparent, fair and efficient procurement systems in member countries.</p>
          <p>The IsDB’s Member Country Partnership (MCP) Strategy, initiated in 2010, aims to strengthen dialogue with individual member countries and thus to contribute more effectively to their medium- and long-term development plans. In recent years Global Value Chain-driven MCP strategies (GVC-MCPs) have been introduced. Dimensions on women’s and youth empowerment were mainstreamed into the MCP Strategy in 2022. A new IsDB business model was introduced in 2020 (with a focus on market efficiency, stimulating local supply chains and job creation). In September 2021 the Bank initiated a Resilience Index to assist economic policymakers. A (digital) e-Disbursement Platform was also initiated in that month to facilitate more efficient tracking of disbursements.</p>
          <p>The IsDB participates—with the OPEC Fund, Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa, Arab Monetary Fund and other partners—in the Arab Coordination Group (ACG), a strategic alliance that was established in 1975. The Group aims collectively to optimize resources in order to advance sustainable development.</p>
          <p>In June 2023, during the Summit for a New Global Financing Pact, convened in Paris, France, the IsDB, African Development Bank, European Investment Bank and World Health Organization collectively launched a Health Impact Investment Platform, focused on strengthening essential, climate and crisis-resilient primary health care services in low and middle income states.</p>

               <p>In June 2022 the Board of Governors endorsed a Strategic Realignment (2023-2025), to reposition the Bank’s programming, taking into account the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis and conflict in Ukraine. Severe drought in East Africa had further aggravated food security. The Strategic Realignment had three main areas of focus: (i) Boosting recovery; (ii) Tackling poverty and building resilience; and (iii) Driving green economic growth; and two principal pillars. The first pillar, Supporting Green, Resilient and Sustainable Infrastructure, was focused on Clean and renewable energy; Sustainable multi-model transport; Agriculture and rural development; Information and communication technology and digitalization; Social infrastructure; and Urban development, water and sanitation. The second pillar, on Inclusive Human Capital Development, was focused on Universal healthcare/services; Resilient and quality education; Nutrition and food security; Social protection; and Micro, small and medium-sized enterprises and job creation. Islamic finance, climate change, capacity development, and women and youth were cross-cutting themes.</p>

               <p>In June 2005 the Board of Governors approved the establishment of the ITFC as an autonomous trade promotion and financing institution within the Bank Group; its inaugural meeting was held in February 2007. Through direct or co-financing the ITFC supports the development of intra-OIC trade. The Bank also finances other trade financing operations, including the Islamic Corporation for the Development of the Private Sector (ICD) and the Awqaf Properties Investment Fund (APIF). In addition, a Trade Co-oper­ation and Promotion Programme supports efforts to enhance trade among member countries of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). In 2022 trade financing approved through the ITFC amounted to ID&#8201;5,118.9m., and operations approved by the ICD totalled ID&#8201;425.2m.</p>

               <p>
        In November 2019 the Bank introduced a Sustainable Finance Framework, under which funding raised through the Sukuk bond method was to be directed to green initiatives. The IsDB’s Climate Action Plan (2020-25) aimed to increase the climate action-related proportion of Bank Group investment to 35% by 2025; in 2022 it accounted for 33% of approvals. In November 2022 the ACG committed to issuing US&#8201;$24,000m. during 2023-30 in investment to combat the climate crisis; this was to include at least $13,000m. in IsDB climate adaptation and mitigation finance. A further $10,000m. was committed by the ACG in December 2023, to support the affordable transition to renewable energy use in developing countries. At that time the IsDB initiated a conceptual framework and action plan aimed at aligning the organization’s activities with the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. The Bank contributed to a report, 
        <publ-name>Mobilising Islamic Banking for Climate Action</publ-name>
