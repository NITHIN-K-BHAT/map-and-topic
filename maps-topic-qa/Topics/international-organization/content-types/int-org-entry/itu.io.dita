        The Radiocommunication Bureau (known by its French acronym, BR) has departments of Study Groups (SGs); Space Services; Terrestrial Services; and of Informatics, Administration and Publications. SGs, comprising more than 5,000 telecommunication specialists, develop the technical basis for matters addressed by World Radiocommunication Conferences (WRCs) and ITU-R Recommendations (global technical standards)âof which some become binding, if incorporated by reference into Radio Regulations. In 2024 the following ITU-R SGs were active: Spectrum management; Radiowave propagation; Satellite services; Terrestrial services; Broadcasting service
        <!--sic-->
        ; and Science services. Technical work on certain specific issues is conducted by Radiocommunication Assemblies. The role of ITU-R is globally to manage, and to ensure the equitable, efficient and interference-free use of the radio frequency (RF) spectrum and satellite orbits (limited resources that are used by an ever expanding number of fixed, mobile, amateur, broadcasting, meteorology, emergency telecommunications, environmental monitoring and communications services, space research services, and global positioning systems). Frequency assignments notified to ITU by member states are recorded in a Master International Frequency Register (MIFR). ITU-R supports the implementation of Recommendations, regional agreements and the Radio Regulations. The Space Services Department co-ordinates and records procedures for space systems and earth stations, manages space-related RF assignment plans, and ensures the suitability of proposed orbital slots, with a focus on preventing harmful interference. A Space Networks List and Space Networks Systems Database are maintained. The 
        <publ-name>BR Space Services</publ-name>
        , detailing frequency assignments to space stations, Earth stations and radioastronomy stations, is issued by ITU-R every two weeks (IFIC being an acronym for International Frequency Information Circular). In October 2023 ITU-R issued a new 
        <publ-name>Handbook on Small Satellites</publ-name>
        . The Terrestrial Services Department assists in the international management of the RF spectrum in relation to broadcasting, fixed, aeronautical mobile and maritime mobile services. ITU-R is responsible for defining and recommending standards and frequency arrangements for international mobile telecommunications (IMT), in collaboration with governments, industry and the private sector. ITU-Râs GLAD online repository includes international means of identification such as the Maritime Identification DigitsâMIDs and International Call Sign Series assigned to shipping. The Maritime Mobile Access and Retrieval System (MARS) provides access to operational information registered in the ITU maritime database. A

        The Telecommunication Standardization Bureau comprises departments of Telecommunication Standardization Policy, SGs, and Operations and Planning. In 2024 ITU-T SGs were addressing, 
        <i>inter alia,</i>
         Environment, electromagnetic fields (EMF) and circular economy; Broadband, cable and TV; Future networks; Transport, access and home; Multimedia and digital technologies; and Internet of Things (IoT), smart cities and communities. Regional groups within the ITU-T SGs guide their activities to take into account the particular requirements of all global regions. Focus groups are convened, in particular to give consideration to emerging technologies. In 2024 ITU-T focus groups were considering: the metaverse; testbeds federations for IMT-2020 and beyond; AI and IoT for digital agriculture; AI for natural disaster management; autonomous networks; AI for health; and cost models for affordable data services. The SGs develop, and World Telecommunication Standardization Assemblies (WTSAs) adopt, ITU-T Recommendations (standards), aimed at guaranteeing the effective provision of telecommunication services. Under an Alternative Approval Process (AAP) Recommendations may be approved by fast track, overriding the interval between conferences, if a sectoral SG concludes such action to be urgent. More than 4,000 ITU-T Recommendations were in effect in 2024, addressing, 
        <i>inter alia</i>

           Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development (founded in 2010 as the UN Broadband Commission for Digital Development and renamed in 2015) pursues seven advocacy targets, to be achieved by 2025: make broadband policy universal; make broadband affordable; get everyone online (ITU reported that 67% of the worldâs population had online access in 2023); promote digital skills development; increase use of e-finance; get micro-, small- and medium sized enterprises (MSMEs) online; and bridge the gender digital divide. The Broadband Commissionâs 
          <publ-name>The State of Broadband 2023,</publ-name>
           issued in September, addressed progress towards meeting the seven advocacy targets. In April 2022 ITU and the UN Secretary-Generalâs Special Envoy on Technology jointly announced aspirational targets on digital connectivity to be achieved by 2030, including that 100% of the global population should be covered by the most current mobile networks; more than 70% of internet users should have basic digital skills, with more than 50% possessing intermediate digital skills (for example the ability to install software); internet access should be affordable for all; all fixed-broadband subscriptions should be at least 10 megabits per second; and download speeds of 20 megabits per second should be available in all schools. ITU-D identifies connectivity gaps, including through broadband mapping using Geographic Information Systems. It advocates for enhanced access to affordable, reliable sources of electricity as a key factor in closing the digital divide in rural and other remote areas, particularly in developing countries. With a view to promoting affordable telecommunications and high-speed connectivity in developing countries, the BDT issues an
