      The ITUC was established in November 2006 by the merger of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU, founded in 1949 by trade union federations that had withdrawn from the 
      <xr pageref="N" ref="WFTU.IO">World Federation of Trade Unions</xr>
      ), the World Confederation of Labour (founded in 1920 as the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions and reconstituted in 1968), and eight national trade union organizations. The ITUC aims to defend and promote the rights of working people. It encourages co-operation between trade unions, and campaigns for global coherence in developing policies that place investment in jobs, fair wages and social protection at the core of economic growth and social justice. The ITUC promotes participation by unions in policymaking.

               <p id="ICFTU.IO.65">The World Congress, the highest authority of the ITUC, meets in ordinary session at least once every four years. The fifth Congress was held in Melbourne, Australia, in November 2022. An extraordinary World Congress was convened in October 2023 (see under General Council).</p>
               <p id="ICFTU.IO.66">Delegations from national federations vary in size on the basis of their paying membership. The Congress examines past activities and financial reports of the Confederation; reports on the activities of the ITUC's regional organizations and on the Council of Global Unions (in which the ITUC participates); addresses general policy questions; maps out future plans; considers proposals for amendments to the Constitution and other proposals submitted by member organizations; and elects the General Council, the General Secretary and the Confederation's three auditors.</p>

        Elected by the Congress, the General Council comprises 70 members who represent regions (Europe: 26; the Americas: 18; Asia-Pacific: 15; Africa: 11), with a target of 40% minimum representation by women; six `at large members’ members nominated by the Council’s Women's Committee; and two `at large’ members nominated by its Youth Committee. The General Secretary of the

        <xr pageref="N" ref="OECD.IO">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development</xr>
         may also participate. The Council meets at least once a year and acts as the supreme authority of the Confederation between World Congresses, with responsibility for directing the activities of the Confederation and effecting decisions and recommendations of the Congress. The Council's agenda is prepared by the General Secretary. On 21 December 2022 an extraordinary meeting of the General Council suspended the organization’s recently elected General Secretary, Luca Visentini, who had been arrested in Belgium earlier in that month and questioned over his acceptance in October of a cash donation allegedly linked to sources in Qatar and Morocco. (Visentini denied any impropriety, claiming that no conditions had been attached to the gift.) In mid-January 2023 the Council established a Special Commission that was tasked with investigating the allegations against Visentini, and with conducting an external audit of the organization’s financial affairs and of its internal financial and electoral rules and procedures. An extraordinary meeting of the General Council convened on 11 March unanimously adopted the report presented by the Special Commission, which found no evidence that donations originating in Qatar or Morocco had influenced the ITUC’s policymaking or programming. The Council concluded, however, that it no longer had confidence in Luca Visentini’s tenure of the post of General Secretary. A new General Secretary, Luc Triangle, was elected at an extraordinary ITUC World Congress that was held in mid-October (having assumed the position initially in an acting capacity in May). The October Congress also adopted amendments to ITUC’s Constitution aimed at strengthening electoral procedures. Meanwhile, upon the recommendation of the Special Commission, the General Council determined to construct an explicit anti-corruption policy and code of conduct.

          <p>The ITUC has designated the following as cross-sector `frontline’ issues: Democracies for People (`Fighting for Democracy’ was declared by the General Council in December 2023 to be ITUC’s priority theme for 2024); A New Social Contract for Recovery and Resilience (in November 2022 the fifth ITUC World Congress issued a Statement on a New Social Contract between workers, governments and businesses, with a focus on advancing Jobs; Rights; Wages; Social Protection; Equality; and Inclusion); and Climate- and Employment-Proof Our Work with Just Transition (the need for `just transition of the workforce and the creation of decent work and quality jobs’ is enshrined in the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, in relation to technological advancements and shifts in energy developed in the context of adapting to and mitigating the impacts of climate change). The ITUC’s activities are focused around four pillars:</p>

               <p>
        The ITUC’s Peace, Democracy and Rights pillar has three thematic areas: Peace and Disarmament, Countries at Risk, and Migration and Slavery. In April 2022 the ITUC, with the 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="WB0231XD.IO.TXT.28">International Peace Bureau</xr>
         and Sweden’s Olof Palme Center, released 
        <publ-name>For Our Shared Future,</publ-name>
         detailing recommendations on strengthening common global security; these emphasized the need for, 
        <i>inter alia,</i>
         global and regional co-operation, multilateralism, rule of law, dialogue and responsible governance. In November the ITUC issued 
        <publ-name>Freedom Report 2022: Unions Building Peace</publ-name>
        , which emphasized the critical role played by trade unions in combating authoritarianism, oppression, conflict and exclusion. Also in November, the fifth ITUC World Congress adopted emergency resolutions that condemned the Russian Federation’s (Belarus-assisted) invasion of Ukraine; stated solidarity with pro-women’s rights protesters in Iran; and focused on the need to combat far-right extremist ideologies. 
      </p>
               <p>
        The ITUC prepares an annual Global Rights Index. The 10th edition, released in June 2023, measured the protection of workers’ rights in 163 countries during 2022, with regard to 97 internationally recognized indicators. It found that the right to strike had been violated in 87% of countries (compared with 63% in 2014), the right to engage in collective bargaining had been denied for certain or all workers in 79%, and freedom of assembly and free speech had been denied or constrained in 42%. Moreover, workers had been prohibited from establishing or joining a trade union in 77% of countries (particularly affected were platform workers—for example certain delivery drivers, temporary workers, migrant workers, domestic workers, and workers in the informal economy and in special economic zones). The Index rated countries in five bandings, ranging from no guarantee of rights, through systemic, regular or repeated violations of rights, to (the best category) sporadic violations of rights. The 10 countries most actively repressive to workers’ rights were reported to be Bangladesh, Belarus, Ecuador, Egypt, Eswatini, Guatemala, Myanmar, the Philippines, Tunisia and Türkiye. Workers had been exposed to violence in 44 countries in 2022, and trade unionists were reported to have been murdered during that year in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Eswatini, Guatemala, Peru and Sierra Leone. The ITUC supports ratification of the 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-UN.2077">International Labour Organization (ILO)’s</xr>
         Convention 
        
        No. 190, which aims to eliminate violence and harassment in the work place. The ITUC also advocates for fair recruitment of migrant workers and for the end of bonded labour systems (modern slavery) and child labour.

               <heading>Regulating Economic Power</heading>
               <p>Under this pillar the ITUC focuses on corporate power; multilateralism; jobs; and shared prosperity. Issues addressed include combating the impacts on the labour market of global corporations (such as the prevalence of informal precarious labour contracts); developing appropriate taxation systems; improving public services and social protection systems; and formulating global standards relating to platform businesses (a business model that facilitates exchanges between two or more independent groups, and hitherto has notably evaded national legislation and taxation), and relating to data management (with a focus on privacy and surveillance protections).</p>
               <p>In November 2022 the fifth ITUC World Congress reported that more than 250m. jobs had been lost owing to impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, and that levels of underemployment had worsened in many countries. The Congress demanded that by 2030 575m. new jobs should be created globally, and one-half of all informal jobs should be formalized. </p>

               <heading>Equality</heading>
               <p>
        The ITUC opposes discrimination, marginalization and exclusion on the basis of, 
        <i>inter alia,</i>
         class, age, ethnicity, gender identity, disability and migration status, and emphasizes that the intersection of these characteristics pervades the world of work. The ITUC promotes women’s leadership, and notes the high global gender pay gap (detrimental to women), as well as the high share of unpaid care work undertaken by women. It has advocated for universal access to free, high-quality public healthcare and for a Global Fund for Universal Social Protection. In February 2024 the ITUC joined the Global Coalition for Social Justice (an initiative of the 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-UN.2077">ILO</xr>
        ).

               <p>
        This focuses on the thematic areas of climate and future of work. The Just Transition Centre, established in 2016, by the ITUC with other partners, promote social dialogue in planning a low-carbon future agenda. The ITUC urges all employers to develop plans that climate-proof their operations, and encourages all governments to develop, with the involvement of trade unions at all levels, `Just Transition’ measures that address, and protect workers and communities from, the onwards impacts of climate change. Furthermore, the ITUC focuses on the impacts of technology (such as digitalization, automation and data collection) on job opportunities and on supply chains. In November 2022 the fifth ITUC World Congress demanded that regulatory frameworks ensure decent working conditions for remote workers. In February 2023 a report commissioned by the ITUC, 
        <publ-name>Algorithmic transparency and accountability in the world of work</publ-name>
        , focused on means of addressing risks arising from automation in the workplace. The ITUC advocated for and welcomed the inclusion of references to labour rights and social protection in a Just Transitions Work Programme that was agreed by the 28th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, held in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
