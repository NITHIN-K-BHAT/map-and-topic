          <p id="NATO.IO.246" usage="ewyb edio casee eerca">The Atlantic Alliance was established on the basis of the 1949 North Atlantic Treaty as a defensive political and military alliance of a group of European states (then numbering 10) and the USA and Canada. The Alliance aims to provide common security for its members through co-operation and consultation in political, military and economic fields, as well as scientific, environmental and other non-military aspects. Focus is placed on the core tasks of deterrence and defence; crisis prevention and management; and co-operative security. The objectives of the Alliance are implemented by NATO. A NATO Strategic Concept is approved periodically (normally around every 10 years), providing for adaptation to developments in the security environment.</p>

The Allied JFC Headquarters, based, in Brunssum, Netherlands, and Naples, Italy, are each able to deploy a major joint operation into theatre, comprising a Combined Air Operations Centre and static air, land and maritime commands. In February 2017 NATO defence ministers agreed to establish a regional Hub for the South at JFC Naples, to address threats arising from North Africa and the Middle East; this was declared fully operational in July 2018. A NATO Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure, based within the Allied Maritime Command, was established in February 2023.</p>
                    <p>Periodic reviews of NATO's structures have been undertaken in response to changes in the security environment. In October 2019 Croatia, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia signed an accord establishing a new Regional Special Operations Component Command (R-SOCC), which was to be fully operational by December 2024. It was reported that Austria (a NATO partner state) would also participate in R-SOCC.</p>

          <p>The common security policy of the members of the North Atlantic Alliance is to safeguard peace through the maintenance of political solidarity and adequate defence at the lowest level of military forces needed to deter all possible forms of aggression. Each year, member countries take part in a Defence Review, designed to assess their contribution to the common defence in relation to their respective capabilities and constraints. Allied defence policy is reviewed periodically by ministers responsible for defence. Political consultations within the Alliance take place on a per­manent basis, under the auspices of the NAC, on all matters affecting the common security interests of the member countries. NATO’s Standing Naval Forces are a core maritime capability of the Alliance and aim to underpin collective defence and deterrence, crisis management, and co-operative security.</p>

        , OSCE), in November 1990 the member countries of NATO and the Warsaw Pact signed the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE), whereby conventional arms would be reduced to within a common upper limit in each zone. The two groups also issued a Joint Declaration, stating that they were no longer adversaries and that none of their weapons would ever be used `except in self-defence'. In March 1992, under the auspices of the CSCE, the ministers responsible for foreign affairs of NATO and of the former Warsaw Pact countries (with the Russian Federation, Belarus, Ukraine and Georgia taking the place of the dissolved Union of Soviet Socialist Republics—USSR) signed the `Open Skies' treaty. Under this treaty, aerial reconnaissance missions by one country over another were to be permitted, subject to regulation. The eight former Soviet republics with territory in the area of application of the CFE Treaty committed themselves to honouring its obligations in June. In November 1999, at an OSCE summit meeting held in İstanbul, Turkey (known since June 2022 as Türkiye), an Adapted CFE Treaty was signed, providing for substantial reductions in the maximum levels of conventional military equipment at national and territorial level, to replace the bloc-to-bloc structure of the original Treaty. At the same time a series of agreements or Commitments, was approved which required Russia to withdraw forces from and reduce levels of military equipment in Georgia and Moldova, a process to be monitored by NATO. The Adapted CFE Treaty was ratified by Belarus in 2000, by Kazakhstan in 2003, and by Russia in 2004. The Allied states, however, postponed its ratification, pending Russia’s fulfilment of the 1999 Commitments. An extraordinary conference of the parties to the CFE was convened in June 2007 to consider Russia's security concerns regarding the conditions that the Allies had imposed in relation to their ratification of the Adapted CFE Treaty; in the following month, however, the Russian Government confirmed that it was to suspend obligations under the Treaty, with effect from mid-December. In November 2011 NATO CFE allies determined to cease implementing certain CFE obligations with regard to Russia, in view of Russia’s continuing unilateral suspension of its obligations under the Treaty. However, they continued to implement the Treaty with regard to Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Moldova and Ukraine (rendering it probable that Belarus was sharing relevant information with Russia). Russia formally withdrew from the Treaty in November 2023, and, consequently, the NAC determined at that time to suspend operation of the Treaty `for as long as necessary’.

               <p>In June 2001 the first formal meeting of the Military Committees of the European Union (EU) and NATO took place to exchange information relating to the development of EU-NATO security co-operation. Since November 2003 NATO and the EU have conducted joint crisis management exercises. In order to support an integrated security structure in Europe, NATO also co-operates with the OSCE and has provided assistance for the development of the latter's conflict prevention and crisis management activities.</p>
               <p>On 12 September 2001 the NAC agreed to invoke, for the first time, Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, providing for collective self-defence, in response to terrorist attacks against targets in the USA that had taken place on the previous day. The measure was formally implemented in early October after the US authorities presented evidence substantiating claims that the attacks had been directed from abroad. The NAC endorsed eight specific US requests for logistical and military support in its efforts to counter-terrorism, including enhanced sharing of intelligence and full access to airfields and ports in member states. It also agreed to dispatch five surveillance aircraft to help to patrol US airspace and directed the Standing Naval Forces to the Eastern Mediterranean.</p>
               <p>In November 2002 NATO heads of state and of government, convened in Prague, Czech Republic (Czechia), approved a comprehensive reform of the Alliance’s capabilities. The command structure was to be reduced and redefined, under oper­ational and functional strategic commands, while a NATO Response Force (NRF), comprising a flexible and interoperable force of readily deployable land, sea and air elements, was to be established. The NRF was inaugurated in October 2003, with a force strength of 9,500 troops. It was intended to enable NATO to react swiftly and efficiently in new areas of operation, such as evacuations, disaster management and counter-terrorism. The NRF achieved its (then) full capacity, of 25,000 troops, in November 2006.</p>
               <p>A new Strategic Concept, titled Active Engagement, Modern Defence, was adopted by NATO heads of state and of government, meeting in Lisbon, Portugal, in November 2010. The document identified the challenges posed by the evolving security environment and sought to enhance NATO’s defence and deterrence capacities accordingly, while reaffirming its core tasks of collective defence, crisis management and co-operative security. NATO leaders approved the development of an updated European missile defence capability, as well as measures to strengthen cyber defence capabilities. They also endorsed an extensive reform of NATO's civil and military command structures, in order to enhance the organization's efficiency and flexibility.</p>
               <p>A meeting of NATO heads of state and of government, convened in May 2012, in Chicago, Illinois, USA, endorsed new NATO Policy Guidelines on Counter-Terrorism and endorsed the Chicago Defence Declaration and Defence Package, which outlined a vision of, and guidelines towards achieving, a new capabilities objective, `NATO Forces 2020’. This envisaged modern, closely connected forces equipped, trained, exercised and commanded in a manner that would enable them to operate jointly, and with partners, in any environment. A new Joint Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (JISR) data-gathering initiative was endorsed by the summit. (A revised concept for the JISR was approved in 2013.) A Connected Forces Initiative (CFI) was also approved to help to maintain NATO’s combat readiness and effectiveness through expanded education and training, increased exercises and improved use of technology. NATO Forces 2020 was to represent a shift in the Alliance’s focus from operational engagement to operational preparedness. The summit declared an interim NATO Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) capacity, and tasked the Council with reviewing on a regular basis the implementation of BMD capabilities.</p>
               <p>
        Meetings of the NAC were convened in June and October 2012 within the framework of Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty—invoked when the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the parties is threatened—with regard to alleged violations of Türkiye’s borders by Syrian forces. In December NATO ministers responsible for foreign affairs agreed to strengthen Türkiye's air defence capabilities along its border with the Syrian Arab Republic, and, from February 2013 
        <i>Patriot</i>
         (`Phased Array Tracking Radar to Intercept on Target’) missile batteries were deployed defensively under NATO command in southern Türkiye. In April the Secretary-General stated the Alliance’s extreme concern over the use of ballistic missiles in the ongoing conflict in Syria, and at allegations that chemical weapons had been deployed. Meeting in late August the NAC strongly condemned the use of chemical weapons against civilians in Ghouta, Damascus.

               <p>In early March 2014 a meeting of the NAC was convened, at Poland’s request, to address the implications for regional stability of ongoing violations by Russia of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine. Later in that month the NATO Secretary-General described the Ukraine crisis as a geopolitical `game-changer’. On 1 April NATO formally suspended practical civilian and military co-operation with Russia, and in mid-April the NAC agreed on a package of extra measures, including enhanced military exercises and the updating of defence plans; the number of sorties by the Alliance’s air policing aircraft over the Baltic region was to increase with immediate effect, and, furthermore, warships were to be deployed to the Baltic Sea and to the East Mediterranean.</p>
               <p usage="ewyb edio">In late June 2014 the Secretary-General expressed concern over reports that pro-Russian militia active in eastern Ukraine were acquiring heavy weaponry from Russia. He urged Russia fully to withdraw its military forces from the Ukraine border area, to act to halt the flow of weaponry and combatants into Ukraine, to encourage Ukrainian armed separatists to disarm and to renounce violence, and to co-operate with the ongoing efforts of the Ukraine authorities to promote peace, unity and reform. The Secretary-General again expressed concern at an escalation of Russian military involvement in eastern Ukraine in August.</p>
               <p>A meeting of NATO heads of state and of government, convened in September 2014, in Newport, Wales, UK, issued the Wales Summit Declaration, in which they emphasized the role of the Alliance as a source of stability, and reaffirmed commitment to fulfilling the three core tasks laid out in the Alliance’s Strategic Concept, i.e. collective defence, crisis management and co-operative security. The NATO leaders approved a new NATO Readiness Action Plan (RAP), providing a comprehensive package of measures aimed at strengthening the Alliance’s collective defence capabilities in reacting to hybrid warfare threats. The Plan provided for the development of a continuous air, land and maritime presence in the eastern part of the Alliance, which was to be flexible and scaleable in response to the evolving security situation. The responsiveness of the NRF was to be enhanced significantly, including through the establishment of a new Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF, or `Spearhead Force’), capable of being deployed within a few days, with a focus on challenges arising at the periphery of NATO’s territory. Standing Naval Forces were to be enhanced to support maritime situational awareness, as well as to conduct conventional maritime operations. An Enhanced Cyber Defence Policy was endorsed by the Wales summit meeting, which recognized cyber defence as a core task of collective defence. A Defence and Related Security Capacity Building Initiative was launched, aimed at advising and supporting both partner and non-partner nations, in addition to a new Partnership Interoperability Initiative (q.v.).</p>
               <p>In February 2015 NATO ministers responsible for defence agreed that the enhanced NRF would comprise around 30,000 troops, and that in a situation of major crisis the new Spearhead Force’s 5,000-strong land brigade would be rapidly reinforced by two further brigades. Six NRF command and control units were established at that time, in Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania. Meeting in late June NATO ministers of defence determined to enhance the NRF further, to comprise 40,000 personnel, and to establish a new Joint Logistics Headquarters.</p>
               <p>An updated NATO Air Command and Control System was initiated in July 2015; at full deployment it was envisaged that this would connect a network consisting of more than 20 military aircraft control centres.</p>
               <p usage="ewyb edio">In July 2015, at the request of the Turkish Government, under Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty, the NAC met to consider the ongoing threat to peace and security in that country. The Council expressed strong solidarity with Türkiye and determined to observe closely the situation in its border area. In early October the NAC expressed deep concern over escalating Russian military activity in Syria, with particular reference to attacks by the Russian Air Force on Hama, Homs and Idlib, on the grounds that these had not targeted Islamic State, and had caused casualties among the civilian population. The Council also protested against recent Russian violations of Turkish airspace. In late November an extraordinary meeting of the NAC emphasized solidarity with Türkiye following the shooting down of a Russian plane that had entered its airspace.</p>
               <p>In February 2016 NATO ministers responsible for defence resolved to deploy with immediate effect a Standing Maritime Group to the Aegean Sea with a mandate to intercept and return migrants attempting to cross from Türkiye into Greece. The ships, working in close partnership with national coastguards and the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the EU (FRONTEX), were to conduct reconnaissance, monitoring and surveillance activities. During that month NATO and the EU concluded a technical arrangement on future cyber defence co-operation, with a focus on the exchange of information, research, training, and joint exercises. In early March the NATO Secretary-General expressed concern over the continuing Russian military presence in Syria and the eastern Mediterranean, which was fuelling the exodus of Syrian civilians into Türkiye (and, from there, towards northern Europe), and resulting in continued violations of NATO airspace. He announced that surveillance and monitoring of the Türkiye-Syria border, the NATO presence in the eastern Mediterranean, and support for Turkish air defences would be enhanced. Meeting again in June, the NATO ministers of defence agreed to deploy AWACS surveillance aircraft to the international coalition combating Islamic State.</p>
               <p>In July 2016, meeting in Warsaw, Poland, the heads of state and of government of NATO countries and Montenegro issued the Warsaw Communiqué, in which—acknowledging a climate of complex security challenges and threats—they placed renewed emphasis on collective defence and deterrence. The summit meeting noted the impact of destabilizing actions and policies by Russia, citing the annexation of and Russian military build-up in Crimea; destabilization of eastern Ukraine; violation of sovereign borders by force; incursions into NATO airspace; provocative military operations near NATO borders, including in the eastern Mediterranean and the Baltic and Black Sea areas; and military intervention in Syria. NATO leaders reaffirmed, accordingly, the suspension of practical and military co-operation with Russia, the deployment of a forward presence in eastern Alliance territories, and willingness to pursue political dialogue and to maintain military lines of communication with Russia. The Warsaw summit agreed to deploy, from early 2017, an enhanced Forward Presence (eFP) in Estonia (to be based in Tapa), Latvia (located in Adazi), Lithuania (Rukla), and Poland (Orzysz), comprising four battlegroups of multinational forces. The Presence was intended to demonstrate clearly member states’ determination to act collectively and decisively in response to aggression. A further eFP was to be deployed in south-eastern member states and the Black Sea region. The leaders agreed a set of measures aimed at responding to the threat posed by non-state actors with state-like aspirations. A functional assessment of the NATO command structure was to be undertaken, in the light of the changing security environment. The organization’s situational awareness was to be enhanced, with a particular focus on eastern and southern areas, and the North Atlantic. The Alliance’s Standing Naval Forces were to be reinforced and aligned with the enhanced NRF, to establish the highest level of readiness. A new initiative in the Mediterranean—Operation Sea Guardian, replacing Operation Active Endeavour—was authorized. (Operation Sea Guardian was deployed from November 2016.) Furthermore, interoperability was to be strengthened, both within NATO as well as with partners, to enable member states’ armed forces to co-ordinate efficiently within NATO operations and in national, coalition, EU and UN formats. At the Warsaw meeting NATO declared a BMD Initial Operational Capability. Participating heads of state and government committed, through a Cyber Defence Pledge, to prioritize the enhancement of national cyber defences, and also to expand the scope of the JISR initiative. A decision made in June by the European Council to enhance relations with NATO was welcomed. (A common set of proposals on co-operation was jointly developed by the NATO Secretary-General and senior EU representatives at that time.)</p>
               <p>In early 2017 it was reported that the incoming US Administration planned to initiate reforms to NATO and its institutions. Addressing a meeting of NATO ministers responsible for defence in February, the new US Secretary of Defence announced that other NATO governments should increase their spending on defence, failing which the USA would `moderate its commitment’ to the Alliance. At a summit of the heads of state or government of NATO countries and Montenegro, held in May, in Brussels, US President Trump reiterated this demand, stating that 23 member states were not contributing sufficient financial support to the Alliance. The NATO Secretary-General, meanwhile, stated at the Brussels summit that the Alliance would formally participate in a non-combat capacity in the global coalition against Islamic State, and noted that its new Joint Intelligence and Security Division would place a particular emphasis on foreign fighters travelling to Iraq and Syria. The summit also approved an action plan on defending against terrorism. On 5 June Montenegro was formally admitted to the Alliance. In February 2018 NATO ministers responsible for defence endorsed the outline of an adapted NATO command structure, tailored to respond more effectively to a changed security environment. </p>
               <!--Jan. 2017 - Trump reportedly described NATO as -obsolete-->
               <p>In April 2018 the NATO Secretary-General welcomed air strikes conducted by the USA, France and the UK against suspected chemical weapons manufacturing facilities and capabilities in Syria. The military action was undertaken—without a UN Security Council mandate—in response to recent chemical attacks allegedly perpetrated by the Syrian regime against civilian sites. The Secretary-General emphasized that NATO had consistently condemned the use of chemical weapons in Syria as a clear and unacceptable breach of international agreements, and as a threat to international peace and security.</p>
               <p>Meeting in July 2018, in Brussels, NATO heads of state and of government reported a `dangerous, unpredictable and fluid’ security environment, including threats and challenges from all strategic directions, from state and non-state actors, and potentially of a terrorist, cyber or hybrid nature (including disinformation campaigns), as well as from military forces. Aggressive actions by Russia—including the threat and use of force to attain political objectives—were noted as a continuing challenge to Euro-Atlantic security and to the rules-based international order, while instability and crises in the Middle East and North Africa were fuelling terrorism and irregular migration. The suspension of all practical civilian and military co-operation between NATO and Russia was maintained; it was emphasized, meanwhile, that NATO continued to seek political dialogue with that country’s administration and posed no threat to Russia. Under a new NATO Readiness Initiative launched by the summit, member states were collectively to offer—at up to 30 days’ notice—an additional 30 kinetic air squadrons, 30 major naval combatants and 30 heavy or medium manoeuvre battalions, plus enabling forces. The meeting welcomed and committed fully to implement a recently agreed Enablement Plan for the Supreme Allied Commander Europe’s Area of Responsibility. It agreed a Joint Air Power Strategy, and declared the initial operational capability of Rapid Air Mobility. A new North Atlantic joint command was to be established in Norfolk, VA, USA, while a Joint Support and Enabling Command, to facilitate the rapid movement of military hardware and troops across Europe, was to be established in Ulm, Germany (this became operational in September 2019). The establishment of a Belgium-based Cyberspace Operations Centre was also approved. At that time the NATO leaders issued the Brussels Declaration on Transatlantic Security and Solidarity.</p>
               <p usage="ewyb edio casee">During February 2019 a NATO Cyber Security Collaboration Hub was launched, with initial participation by computer emergency response teams from Belgium, France, Netherlands, the UK and the USA. (Representatives of cyber industries and academia attend an annual NATO Cyber Symposium.) In June NATO ministers responsible for defence approved a new NATO Space Policy; at that time NATO member states were estimated to own 65% of space satellites. In the following month the NATO Secretary-General urged Russia promptly to resume compliance with the suspended Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty; however, the Treaty lapsed on 2 August. A summit of heads of state and government that was convened in December, in London, to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Alliance’s foundation, as well as 30 years since the fall of the `iron curtain’, formally recognized space as NATO’s fifth domain of operations, in addition to its land, air, sea and cyber dimensions. The meeting reaffirmed the transatlantic bond between Europe and North America, and onwards commitment to the principles of the UN Charter, to Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, to member states’ 2014 Defence Investment Pledge, and to arms control and nuclear non-proliferation.</p>
               <p>In late February 2020 the NAC met, at the request of Türkiye, to address the risks posed by the situation in Syria, following the deaths of at least 33 Turkish soldiers during an aerial raid by Syrian government forces in Idlib. The Allies urged the Syrian regime and Russia to end indiscriminate air strikes against Idlib, and called on them to respect international law. Strong solidarity was expressed for Türkiye, and the NATO Secretary-General stated that NATO would continue to assist that country, including by augmenting its air defences. </p>
               <p>North Macedonia became the 30th member of NATO on 27 March 2020. During that month the armed forces of several states that were participating in response activities aimed at curtailing the spread of COVID-19 requested assistance from NATO (such as use of the Alliance’s Next-Generation Incident Command System) to disseminate real time information to the public. In early June, addressing a videoconference meeting of the global coalition countering Islamic State, the NATO Secretary-General noted that the COVID-19 emergency had impacted the progress of operations, but that a phase of rebuilding capacity was ongoing. On 8 June, in response to the challenge of strengthening NATO’s political dimension, he initiated a new NATO 2030 agenda. This focused on maintaining the Alliance’s military strength through continuing investment, uniting it more intensely politically, and developing a more global outlook through co-operation with partners holding similar values. At that time NATO launched a Counter-Terrorism Reference Curriculum to support the development of counter-terrorism strategies in Allies and partner countries.</p>
               <p>A summit of NATO heads of state and of government that was convened in mid-June 2021, in Brussels, issued the Brussels Summit Communiqué, which determined to open a new chapter in transatlantic relations, endorsed the new NATO 2030 agenda, and invited the Secretary-General to lead the process to develop NATO’s next Strategic Concept. A new Comprehensive Cyber Defence Policy was endorsed, and it was noted that the NAC could decide to invoke Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty in response to cases of hybrid warfare, as well as in response to an armed attack. The meeting determined substantially to enhance NATO’s training and capacity building support to partners. A regular NATO climate and security dialogue was to be convened henceforth to address climate change, which was designated as a general threat multiplier. A NATO Policy on Preventing and Responding to Conflict-Related Sexual Violence was endorsed.</p>
               <p usage="ewyb edio casee">On 20 August 2021 the NAC met in extraordinary session, in a virtual format, to discuss the recent takeover of Afghanistan by the militant Taliban organization. In late August the Secretaries-General of NATO and the UN participated in a virtual meeting of the Group of Seven (G7) leaders of major advanced economies to address the crisis in Afghanistan: support for the ongoing international humanitarian response in the wider region was prioritized.</p>
               <p>In October 2021 NATO defence ministers endorsed an updated NATO Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security, covering the period 2021-25. They also adopted NATO’s first policy on data exploitation, and inaugural strategy on artificial intelligence (AI)—detailing secure and ethical means of applying AI technologies in the sphere of defence and security. A multi-sovereign venture capital NATO Innovation Fund (to invest €1,000m. in start-up enterprises developing defence and security technologies) and a Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic (DIANA—consisting of a network of around 60 technology testing and accelerating centres) were also initiated at that time; DIANA became operational in June 2023. A senior management team was appointed in July to govern the Innovation Fund.</p>
               <p>At the end of 2021 NATO reported that during that year Allied fighter jets had been scrambled on around 370 occasions to check aircraft that had approached NATO air space unannounced; about 290 of the missions were in response to Russian military aircraft, and most occurred in the Baltic region.</p>
               <p>In December 2021 the NAC stated grave concern at the substantial Russian build-up of forces and equipment near Ukraine’s borders, and rejected as false Russian accusations of Ukrainian and NATO provocations. Russia was called upon to de-escalate the situation immediately, and to pursue diplomatic channels of communication.</p>

               <p>In early January 2022 an extraordinary meeting of NATO ministers responsible for foreign affairs took place, in a virtual format, to address the significantly escalating tensions arising from Russia’s intensified military presence in and around Ukraine. At that time the NATO Secretary-General stated that aggressive actions by Russia were deeply undermining the security order in Europe, and reiterated that further aggression against Ukraine would result in serious consequences for Russia. A series of diplomatic engagements with Russia was organized soon afterwards, including a meeting of the NATO-Russia Council (q.v.). In late January the NATO Secretary-General confirmed that, in co-ordination with the US Administration, NATO had sent a series of written proposals to Russia, ideally to be addressed within the NATO-Russia Council framework, that focused on advancing NATO-Russia relations; European security (including the situation in and around Ukraine); and risk reduction, arms control, and transparency. From the second half of January a scheduled NATO maritime deployment to the Baltic Sea was undertaken, and the Allied ship and fighter jet presence in eastern Europe was reinforced.</p>
               <p usage="ewyb edio casee">
        Consultations addressing the recently significantly heightened security tensions continued from January 2022 with, 
        <i>inter alia,</i>
         Ukraine, Finland, Georgia, Moldova, Sweden, and the EU. On 21 February the NATO Secretary-General condemned a decision by the Russian authorities to grant formal recognition to the self-proclaimed `Donetsk People’s Republic’ and `Luhansk People’s Republic’ (eastern Ukraine). An extraordinary session of the NAC was convened on 24 February, called for by Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia in the context of Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty, in response to Russia’s full-scale military invasion of Ukraine earlier in that day. The Council strongly deplored Russia’s act of aggression, and also condemned Belarus for enabling Russia’s assault on Ukraine. The Council called on Russia immediately to cease its military action, to withdraw its forces from Ukraine, to respect international humanitarian law, and to allow unhindered safe humanitarian access to all affected civilians. The Council confirmed that Allied defence plans were being activated, including the deployment of defensive land, air and maritime rapid response reinforcements to the Alliance’s eastern zone. An extraordinary summit of NATO heads of state was held in a virtual format on 25 February, with invited participation by the leaders of Finland, Sweden and the EU. The summit deplored the loss of life and the destruction ongoing in Ukraine, and called on Russia to withdraw its military forces immediately, noting that Russia would be held accountable globally as an aggressor, and Belarus as Russia’s enabler. The summit committed to continuing to assist Ukraine, and to strengthening (rather than reducing, as demanded by Russia) support for, 
        <i>inter alia,</i>
         Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia and Moldova. In mid-March 2022 an extraordinary meeting of NATO ministers responsible for defence determined to continue to support Ukraine through the provision of military supplies, as well as financial and humanitarian assistance, and to implement measures to strengthen NATO’s collective security. An in-person extraordinary summit meeting was convened on 24 March. Leaders described Russia’s war against Ukraine as `the gravest threat to Euro-Atlantic security in decades’. They announced that, in addition to the recent deployment of an intensified military presence in eastern zones, four new multinational battlegroups would be stationed in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia. The transformation of NATO to adapt to the new strategic reality would now be effected, including through enhanced collective exercises, and a strengthening of situational awareness, of cyber capabilities, of capacity to deter disinformation, of civil preparedness, and of readiness to repel biological, chemical, radiological and nuclear threats.

               <p usage="ewyb edio casee">Meeting in Brussels in early April 2022—with participation by representatives of Finland, Sweden, Georgia, the EU, Australia, Japan, the Republic of Korea (South Korea) and New Zealand—NATO ministers responsible for foreign affairs determined to enhance support to Ukraine, to extend tailored assistance to regional partners under pressure from Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, and also to assist partners in the Asia-Pacific region impacted by the global ramifications of the ongoing crisis. The Allies stated support for an international investigation to be conducted into the murders of civilians in Bucha and other Ukrainian locations recently liberated from Russian control. They also approved a Charter underpinning the new DIANA network of technology innovation centres. In mid-May NATO foreign ministers discussed possible accession to the Alliance by Finland and Sweden; formal applications for membership were submitted simultaneously by Finland and Sweden on 18 May. Türkiye stated initial opposition to this development. During May an intensive series of NATO military exercises was conducted in member states, from the Baltic region to the Balkans. In June a trilateral memorandum was concluded between Finland, Sweden and Türkiye, in which the two applicant countries made commitments (including on the extradition of suspected terrorists) with respect to Türkiye’s security concerns relating to the separatist Kurdistan Workers’ Party—Partiya Karkeren Kurdistan.</p>
               <p usage="ewyb edio casee">Finland and Sweden were formally invited to join the Alliance at a summit of NATO heads of state and of government that was held in Madrid, Spain, in late June 2022. The meeting also endorsed a new Strategic Concept, in recognition that a fundamental shift in defence and deterrence was needed to respond to the new security reality. This aimed to enhance capabilities across the land, air, maritime, cyber, and space domains, and against all threats and challenges. It included strengthening the Alliance’s forward defences, enhancing battlegroups in its eastern areas (to be scaled up, where required, to brigade-size units, supported by prepositioned equipment, by rapidly available reinforcements, and by enhanced command and control), transforming the NRF by mid-2024 into a stronger, more versatile multinational and multi-domain Allied Reaction Force (ARF), and increasing the number of NATO high readiness forces to more than 300,000 troops. In a final communiqué issued by the summit, Russia was identified as the `most significant and direct threat’ to the security and stability of the Euro-Atlantic area, and `systemic competition’ was noted from certain states, including China: it was observed that both states were at the vanguard of an authoritarian challenge to the rules-based international order. The Allies pledged to continue to counter Russian threats, and to combat terrorism, in a manner consistent with international law. The challenges posed by the malicious use of emerging and disruptive technologies were noted; as well as cyber, space, and hybrid and other asymmetric threats (for example, disinformation campaigns). Furthermore, the role played by instability beyond member states’ borders in fuelling irregular migration flows and human trafficking was emphasized. Member states pledged to strengthen their energy security. A new chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defence policy was endorsed. A strategy was endorsed that aimed to ensure the seamless delivery of next generation Airborne Warning &amp; Control Systems (AWACS) and related capabilities. A strengthened support package was approved for Ukraine, aimed at accelerating the provision of non-lethal defence equipment, improving national cyber defences and modernizing the defence sector. Longer-term military and financial support were also pledged to support the eventual reconstruction of that country. The EU was deemed a `unique and essential’ partner for NATO in supporting international peace and security. On 5 July 2022 accession protocols for Finland and Sweden were signed by the NATO member states’ Permanent Representatives; ratification of the protocols was then required by the member states’ national legislatures.</p>
               <p usage="edio ewyb casee">In early September 2022 the NAC strongly condemned a recent cyber attack—believed to have been perpetrated by Iran—against Albania’s national information infrastructure. On 23 September the NAC denounced a manoeuvre by the Russian authorities to stage in regions of Ukraine that were under or partly under Russian military control—i.e. Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhya and Kherson—non-democratic `referenda’ on accession to the Russian Federation. A recent Russian decision to enforce a partial national military mobilization was noted as an escalation of the war against Ukraine. Furthermore, `irresponsible nuclear rhetoric’ by Russia was condemned. Towards the end of the month the NAC stated deep collective concern at recent apparent sabotage, in international waters in the Baltic Sea, to the Nordstream 1 and Nordstream 2 gas pipelines that run from northeastern Russia to western Europe. The Council emphasized that the ensuing gas leaks posed a risk to shipping and to the environment. On 30 September, in contravention of international law, Russia’s President Putin signed decrees that purported to incorporate Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhya and Kherson into Russia. On the same day Ukraine submitted a formal application for NATO membership. The NATO Secretary-General termed Russia’s annexation of Ukrainian territory illegal and the most serious escalation thus far of the conflict.</p>
               <p usage="ewyb edio casee">In mid-November 2022 an emergency meeting of the NAC was convened to address an explosion on the previous day in eastern Poland, close to the border with Ukraine, which had reportedly killed two Polish civilians. The meeting concluded that no deliberate attack had been undertaken and preliminary investigations indicated it had been caused by Ukrainian air defence systems. In late November NATO’s ministers responsible for foreign affairs and their Finnish and Swedish counterparts, gathered in Bucharest, Romania, condemned Russia’s `reckless nuclear rhetoric’, ongoing energy blackmail and subversion of the rules-based international order; and reaffirmed solidarity with Poland and their resolute will to support Ukraine’s post-war reconstruction and reform process.</p>
               <p>In early February 2023 the NAC noted with concern a decision by Russia at that time to suspend its participation in (and legally-binding obligations under) the New START Treaty, emphasizing that the treaty made an important contribution to international stability. In that month 16 NATO countries and Finland and Sweden agreed to join a new Alliance Persistent Surveillance from Space (APSS) initiative. A Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell was established in February at NATO’s headquarters, and in March a new NATO-EU Task Force on Resilience of Critical Infrastructure was initiated, to defend against Russia’s weaponization of energy supplies. In mid-March, following a meeting with his Finnish counterpart, Türkiye’s President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan announced that, as Finland had taken `authentic and concrete’ measures to address Türkiye’s security concerns (as agreed in the June 2022 Trilateral Memorandum), ratification of that country’s NATO application would proceed through the Turkish legislature; this was effected at the end of March 2023. On 4 April Finland formally deposited its instrument of accession as the 31st NATO member state. In early June the NAC condemned a decision by Russia to withdraw from the CFE Treaty on 7 November. </p>
               <p usage="edio ewyb casee">In early July 2023 the NAC agreed to extend the mandate of the incumbent NATO Secretary-General, Jens Stoltenberg, which had been due to expire in that year, until 1 October 2024. At the summit of NATO heads of state and of government held in July 2023, in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, the leaders determined to establish a NATO Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure, within NATO’s Maritime Command. At that time the inaugural meeting was convened, with participation by the NATO leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, of a NATO-Ukraine Council, a new format for bilateral consultations. It was affirmed that Ukraine would eventually accede to NATO, and that the usual requirement for a MAP would be waived. A new assistance package for Ukraine was agreed, aimed at upgrading national equipment and protocols, and enabling full interoperability between Ukrainian and NATO forces: a formal membership invitation was to be issued to the country once those conditions were achieved, and the agreement of all Allies secured. The NATO leaders also met with their counterparts from Australia, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and the EU, and the value of co-operation between NATO, EU and Indo-Pacific partners was emphasized. Furthermore, an operational memorandum of understanding was concluded for a new Montreal, Canada-based NATO Climate Change and Security Centre of Excellence (which had been proposed by Canada’s premier in 2021).</p>

        In October 2023, in response to damage perpetrated against critical undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea, NATO intensified surveillance and reconnaissance flights in the area. A Digital Ocean Vision, aimed at further enhancing NATO’s maritime situational awareness, from the seabed to space, was endorsed at that time by the Allied ministers responsible for defence; they also signed a memorandum on advancing the development of a German-led European Sky Shield Initiative. An 11-member group of experts was established in that month to consider evolving developments in NATO’s southern neighbouring (i.e. the Middle East, North Africa and the Sahel). Meanwhile, Russia determined at that time to revoke its ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (which had been effected in 2000)—to ensure parity with the USA, which had signed but not as yet ratified the treaty; relevant legislation was then accelerated through Russia’s legislature. A strategy on the use of quantum technologies for security was approved in that month by NATO ministers responsible for foreign affairs. The inaugural ministerial-level meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council was convened in November 2023. Its work programme for 2024 was to focus on energy security, innovation and interoperability. A Seabed Warfare Symposium, convened at the Alliance’s headquarters in December, with participation by experts from member and partner countries, addressed, 
        <i>inter alia</i>
        , means of defending against threats to critical undersea infrastructure. It was reported at the end of December that NATO air forces across Europe had scrambled on more than 300 occasions during 2023 to intercept Russian military aircraft nearing Alliance airspace (predominantly over the Baltic Sea).

               <p>At an ambassadorial-level meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council that was held in early January 2024, at Ukraine’s request, the Allies reaffirmed their commitment to providing Ukraine with large-scale military, economic, and humanitarian assistance during the year ahead, with a focus on enhancing Ukraine’s air defences. In mid-January a meeting of the NATO Military Committee, plus Sweden, confirmed that the new ARF would be headquartered from mid-2024 (on an interim basis) in Italy. After a protracted delay Türkiye finally approved Sweden’s Accession Protocol in late January 2024. Hitherto, Hungary’s endorsement of Sweden’s accession had been deferred, reportedly given Sweden’s criticism of the political agenda of the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. Orbán, however, assured the other Allies that Hungary would not prevent Sweden from joining NATO, issued an invitation to his Swedish counterpart, Ulf &#160;Kristersson, to visit Hungary to discuss the situation. In late February, in Budapest, Orbán and Kristersson concluded a new bilateral military deal. The Hungarian legislature subsequently approved Sweden’s Accession Protocol and Hungary’s President Sulyok signed it on 5 March. Sweden deposited its instrument of accession with the US Administration on 7 March, marking its formal admission as NATO’s 32nd member state.</p>

      At a summit meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE, now renamed as the 
      <xr pageref="N">Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe—OSCE</xr>
      ) in November 1990, the member countries of NATO and the Warsaw Pact issued a Joint Declaration, stating that they were no longer adversaries and that none of their weapons would ever be used `except in self-defence or otherwise in accordance with the Charter of the Untied Nations’. The two groups also signed an agreement limiting Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE), whereby conventional arms would be reduced to within a common upper limit in each zone. Following the dissolution of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) in December 1991, the eight former Soviet republics with territory in the area of application of the CFE Treaty committed themselves to honouring its obligations in June 1992. The Treaty entered retroactively into full force from 17 July (Armenia was unable to ratify it until the end of July, and Belarus until the end of October).
    </p>
          <p usage="eerca">In March 1992, under the auspices of the CSCE, the ministers responsible for foreign affairs of NATO and of the former Warsaw Pact countries (with Belarus, Georgia, Russia and Ukraine taking the place of the USSR) signed the Open Skies Treaty. Under this treaty, aerial reconnaissance missions by one country over another were to be permitted, subject to regulation. At the summit meeting of the OSCE in December 1996 the signatories of the CFE Treaty agreed to begin negotiations on a revised treaty governing conventional weapons in Europe. In November 1999, at an OSCE summit meeting held in İstanbul, Türkiye, an Adapted CFE Treaty was signed, providing for substantial reductions in the maximum levels of conventional military equipment at national and territorial level, to replace the bloc-to-bloc structure of the original Treaty. At the same time, a series of agreements or Commitments, was approved which required Russia to withdraw forces from and reduce levels of military equipment in Georgia and Moldova, a process to be monitored by NATO. The Adapted CFE Treaty was ratified by Belarus in 2000, by Kazakhstan in 2003, and by Russia in 2004. The Allied states, however, postponed its ratification, pending Russia’s fulfilment of the 1999 Commitments. In April 2007 NATO ministers responsible for foreign affairs held immediate discussions following an announcement by Russia's President Putin that he intended to suspend unilaterally Russia’s implementation of CFE obligations, in view of the conditions that the Allies had imposed in relation to their ratification of the Adapted CFE Treaty. An extraordinary conference of the parties to the CFE was convened in June to consider Russia's security concerns; in the following month, however, the Russian Government confirmed that it was to suspend obligations under the Treaty, with effect from mid-December. In November 2011 NATO CFE allies determined CFE obligations with regard to Russia, in view of Russia’s continuing unilateral suspension of its obligations under the Treaty. However, they continued to implement the Treaty with regard to Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Moldova and Ukraine (rendering it probable that Belarus was sharing relevant information with Russia). During April 2007-March 2015 Russia continued to participate in the Joint Consultative Group that discussed the Treaty’s implementation. Russia formally withdrew from the Treaty in November 2023, and, consequently, the NAC determined at that time to suspend operation of the Treaty `for as long as necessary’.</p>

      In November 1991 NATO heads of government recommended a radical re­structuring of the organization in order to meet the de­mands of the new security environment, owing to the fundamental changes taking place in Central and Eastern Europe. This was to include further reductions in military forces in Europe, active involvement in inter­national peacekeeping operations, increased co-operation with other international institutions and close co-operation with its former adversaries, the USSR and the countries of Eastern Europe. The basis for NATO's new force structure was incorporated into a Strategic Concept, which was adopted in the Rome Declaration issuing from the summit meeting. Substantial reductions in the size and levels of readiness of NATO forces were undertaken, in order to reflect the Alliance's strictly defensive nature, and forces were reorganized within a streamlined integrated command structure. A new Strategic Concept, which confirmed NATO to be the principal generator of security in the Euro-Atlantic area, was endorsed in April 1999 by NATO heads of state and of government. In November 2010 NATO heads of state and of government, meeting in Lisbon, Portugal, adopted a revised Strategic Concept, entitled

          <p usage="eerca">Meeting in February 2013 NATO defence ministers agreed that, within the context of a new Connected Forces Initiative, the role of the NATO Response Force (NRF, inaugurated in October 2003 to enable the Alliance to react swiftly and efficiently in new areas of operation, such as evacuations, disaster management and counter-terrorism), should be enhanced.</p>
          <p usage="eerca">A summit meeting of NATO heads of state and of government convened in September 2014, in Newport, Wales, UK, issued the Wales Summit Declaration, in which—against the background of ongoing instability in Ukraine, as well as in the Middle East and North Africa—they emphasized the role of the Alliance as an essential source of stability, and reaffirmed commitment to fulfilling the three core tasks laid out in the Alliance’s Strategic Concept—collective defence, crisis management and co-operative security. The NATO leaders approved a new NATO Readiness Action Plan (RAP), providing a comprehensive package of measures aimed at strengthening the Alliance’s collective defence capabilities. The Plan provided for the development of a continuous air, land and maritime presence in the eastern part of the Alliance, which was to be flexible and scalable in response to the evolving security situation. The responsiveness of the NRF was to be enhanced significantly, including through the establishment of a new Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF, or `Spearhead Force’), capable of being deployed within a few days, with a focus on challenges arising at the periphery of NATO’s territory. Furthermore, the intelligence and strategic awareness, and advance planning capabilities of the Alliance were to be strengthened, the pre-positioning of equipment and supplies was to be pursued, and collective exercises were to be focused on very specific defence challenges. The Spearhead Force was tested during 2015-16, initially through the `Allied Shield’ series of evaluative exercises focused on Eastern Europe and the Baltic, which commenced in April 2015. Meeting in June NATO defence ministers determined to enhance the NRF further, to comprise 40,000 personnel, and to establish a new Joint Logistics Headquarters.</p>
          <p usage="eerca">In July 2016, meeting in Warsaw, NATO heads of state and of government issued the Warsaw Communiqué, in which—emphasizing a climate of complex security challenges and threats—they placed renewed emphasis on collective defence and deterrence, as well as continued active participation in the global coalition countering Islamic State. The Warsaw summit agreed to deploy, from early 2017, an enhanced Forward Presence (eFP) in Estonia (to be based in Tapa), Latvia (based in Adazi), Lithuania (Rukla), and Poland (Orzysz). The eFP was to comprise four battlegroups of multinational forces, and was intended to demonstrate clearly member states’ determination to act collectively and decisively in response to aggression. A further eFP was to be deployed in southeastern member states and the Black Sea region. The Alliance’s Standing Naval Forces were to be reinforced and aligned with the enhanced NRF, to establish the highest level of readiness. Furthermore, interoperability was to be strengthened, both within NATO as well as with partners, to enable member states’ armed forces to co-ordinate efficiently within NATO operations and in national, coalition, EU and UN formats. At the Warsaw meeting NATO declared a BMD Initial Operational Capability. Participating heads of state and government committed, through a Cyber Defence Pledge, to prioritize the enhancement of national cyber defences, and also to expand the scope of the Joint Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (JISR) initiative.</p>
          <p usage="eerca">Meeting in July 2018, in Brussels, NATO heads of state and of government reported a `dangerous, unpredictable and fluid’ security environment, including threats and challenges from all strategic directions, from state and non-state actors, and potentially of a terrorist, cyber or hybrid nature (including disinformation campaigns), as well as from military forces. A summit of heads of state and government was convened in December, in London, to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Alliance’s foundation, as well as 30 years since the fall of the `iron curtain’. A new NATO 2030 agenda was endorsed by heads of state and of government meeting in June 2021; it aimed to maintain the Alliance’s military strength through continuing investment, to unite the Alliance more intensely politically, and to develop a more global outlook through co-operation with partners holding similar values.</p>

        The EAPC was inaugurated on 30 May 1997 as a successor to the North Atlantic Co-operation Council (NACC), which had been established in December 1991 to provide a forum for consultation on political and security matters with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, including the former Soviet republics. The Council provides the political framework for co-operation between NATO member states and the Partnership for Peace (PfP) countries (Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Ireland, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Malta, Moldova, Russia, Serbia, Sweden, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan). It meets monthly at the level of ambassadors, annually at the level of ministers responsible for foreign affairs and for defence or chiefs of defence, and occasionally at summit level.

               <p>In December 1996 NATO ministers responsible for foreign affairs announced that invitations to join the Alliance would be issued to some former Eastern bloc countries during 1997. The NATO Secretary-General and member governments subsequently began intensive diplomatic efforts to secure Russia's tolerance of these developments. It was agreed that no nuclear weapons or large numbers of troops would be deployed on the territory of any new member country in the former Eastern bloc. In May 1997 NATO and Russia signed the Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Co-operation and Security, which provided for enhanced Russian participation in all NATO decision making activities, equal status in peacekeeping operations and representation at the Alliance headquarters at ambassadorial level, as part of a recognized shared political commitment to maintaining stability and security throughout the Euro-Atlantic region. A NATO-Russian Permanent Joint Council was established under the Founding Act, and met for the first time in July 1996; the Council provided each side the opportunity for consultation and participation in the other's security decisions, but without a right of veto. In March 1999 the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland became members of NATO. In the following month the NATO summit meeting, held in Washington, DC, USA, initiated a new Membership Action Plan (MAP) to extend practical support to aspirant member countries and to formalize a process of reviewing applications. In March 2003 protocols of accession were adopted by the then 19 NATO member states with a view to admitting Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia to the organization. They acceded to the Treaty in March 2004. In April 2008 NATO heads of state and of government, meeting in Bucharest, invited Albania and Croatia to commence accession negotiations and declared support for Georgia and Ukraine to apply for MAP status. The accession protocols for Albania and Croatia were signed in July, and those countries formally acceded to the Treaty in April 2009. Montenegro and North Macedonia formally joined the Alliance in June 2017 and March 2020, respectively. In July 2022 accession protocols for Finland and Sweden were signed by the NATO member states’ Permanent Representatives.

               <heading>Partnership for Peace pro­gramme</heading>
               <p>The PfP pro­gramme was established in January 1994 within the framework of the NACC, and has remained an integral element of the EAPC, incorporating practical military and defence-related co-operation activities that had originally been part of the NACC Work Plan. Participation in the PfP requires an initial signature of a framework agreement, establishing the common principles and objectives of the partnership, the submission of a presentation document, indicating the political and military aspects of the partnership and the nature of future co-operation activities and the development of individual partnership programmes establishing country-specific objectives. In June 1994 Russia, which had previously opposed the strat­egy as being the basis for future enlargement of NATO, signed the PfP framework document, which included a declaration envisaging an `enhanced dialogue' between the two sides. Despite its continuing opposition to any enlargement of NATO, in May 1995 Russia agreed to sign a PfP Individual Partnership Programme, as well as a framework document for NATO-Russian dialogue and co-operation beyond the PfP. The first joint military exercises with countries of the former Warsaw Pact were conducted in September. In June 1995 a PfP Status of Forces Agreement (PfP SOFA)—defining the legal status of Allies' and partners' forces when they are present on each other's territory—was opened for signature. The EAPC was to provide a framework for the development of an enhanced PfP programme, which NATO envisaged would become an essential element of the overall European security structure. Accordingly, the military activities of the PfP were to be expanded to include all Alliance missions and incorporate all NATO committees into the PfP process, thus pro­viding for greater co-operation in crisis management, civil emer­gency planning and training activities. Ministers responsible for defence of NATO and its partner countries were to meet regularly to provide the political guidance for the enhanced Planning and Review Process of the PfP. A Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Centre (EADRCC) was inaugurated in June 1998. In November the NAC approved the establishment of a network of PfP training and education centres. By 2024 34 centres in 13 NATO and 14 partner countries were participating in the network. A policy of establishing individual PfP Trust Funds was approved in 2000. These aimed to provide support for military reform and demilitarization activities in partner countries, in particular the destruction of anti-personnel landmines.</p>
               <p>In November 2002 heads of state and of government endorsed an initiative to formulate Individual Partnership Action Plans (IPAPs) designed to strengthen bilateral relations with a partner country, improve the effectiveness of NATO assistance in that country, and provide for intensified political dialogue. The İstanbul summit meeting in June 2004 agreed to strengthen co-operation with partner countries in the Caucasus and Central Asia. A Special Representative of the Secretary-General to the two regions was appointed in September. IPAPs were concluded with Georgia in October 2004, Azerbaijan in May 2005, Armenia in December, Kazakhstan in January 2006, Moldova in May, Bosnia and Herzegovina in September 2008, and Serbia in January 2015. In October 2016 an IPAP was finalized with the United Arab Emirates.</p>
               <p>In September 2014 NATO heads of state and of government established a Partnership Interoperability Initiative, including an `Interoperability Platform’ that was to enhance NATO and its partners’ capacities jointly to address security challenges. A group of `Enhanced Opportunities Partners’ subsequently held regular political consultations.</p>
               <p usage="eerca">In October 2001 NATO launched `Operation Active Endeavour' to undertake surveillance and monitoring of maritime trade in the Mediterranean area and to detect and deter terrorist activity, including illegal trafficking. In March 2004 the Operation was expanded to include active participation by countries in the EAPC and the PfP programme. An Exchange of Letters between NATO and Russia, concluded in December 2004, facilitated the implementation from February 2006 of joint training activities, and in September NATO authorized the participation of a Russian naval ship in the Operation. Ukraine participated for the first time in June 2007. In November 2016 Operation Active Endeavour was transformed into the non-Article 5-mandated Operation Sea Guardian—a broader maritime security operation, covering further tasks, such as countering terrorism and trafficking, supporting situational awareness, and supporting regional capacity building.</p>

               <p usage="ewyb edio eerca">The NATO-Russia Council (NRC), which replaced the former Permanent Joint Council (PJC), was inaugurated in May 2002. It was envisaged that the Council would have a greater decision making role than the PJC, and would provide a framework for consultation, consensus-building, co-operation, joint decisions and joint actions on a range of issues of common interest, with NATO member states and Russia working as equal partners. The Council was to meet at ambassadorial level each month, and at the level of ministers responsible for foreign affairs and for defence twice a year. In April 2005, at an informal meeting of the ministers responsible for foreign affairs of the NRC, Russia signed the PfP Status of Forces Agreement that provides a legal framework for the movement to and from allied countries, partner countries and Russia of military personnel and support staff. (It was ratified by the Russian Parliament in May 2007.) In June 2005 a meeting of the Council endorsed Political-Military Guidance towards Enhanced Interoperability between Russian and NATO forces, thereby facilitating the preparation of those forces for possible joint operations. An NRC Project for Counter-Narcotics Training was launched in December to combat the trafficking of illegal narcotics from Afghanistan. In August 2008 meetings of the NRC were temporarily suspended owing to Russia's military action in Georgia. The NAC determined that normal relations with Russia could not be continued until Russia demonstrated commitment to the NRC's basic principles of peace and security. In April 2009 the meeting of NATO heads of state and of government determined to resume normal relations with Russia. A meeting of the NRC at ministerial level was convened in June, in Corfu, Greece, at which all sides agreed to resume full political and military co-operation within the framework of the NRC. In November 2010 the NRC, meeting at the level of heads of state, agreed on the need for a new strategic partnership, based on the presumption that each side no longer posed a threat to the other. The NRC leaders also agreed to extend the scope of the ongoing Project for Counter-Narcotics Training to provide further direct support to institutional capacity building. The declaration issued by NATO heads of state and of government, meeting at that time in Lisbon, Portugal, incorporated an invitation to Russia to co-operate with the development of a new European missile defence capability. An updated version of the December 2004 Action Plan on Terrorism was approved by NRC ministers responsible for foreign affairs in April 2011. In June the first joint exercise was conducted under an ongoing Co-operation Airspace Initiative (CAI). In the following month ambassadors and ministers of NRC members, meeting in Sochi, Russia, reaffirmed their commitment to pursuing greater co-operation on missile defence and other security issues. The CAI moved into an operational phase in December, entailing the sharing of information, and agreement on response procedures to address potential terrorist incidents involving civilian aircraft. Also in that month NRC foreign ministers endorsed a plan aimed at enhancing interoperability and logistical co-operation in combating piracy. In March 2012 a first counter-terrorism tabletop exercise was undertaken within the NRC framework, with the aim of testing the capabilities of NRC nations to co-ordinate their responses to a terrorist attack. In July Russia approved an arrangement on multimodal transit, facilitating the transport through Russian territory of ISAF freight traffic to and from Afghanistan. In December 2013 NATO and Russia determined to launch a new trust fund to finance the safe disposal of obsolete and dangerous ammunition in the Kaliningrad area.</p>

The first NATO-Ukraine meeting at the level of heads of state took place in April 1999, and the inaugural meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Commission, provided for under the Charter, was held in March 2000. In November 2002 a NATO-Ukraine Action Plan was adopted, which provided for a structured programme of activities. In February 2005 NATO announced that it would launch a project, the largest of its kind ever undertaken, to assist Ukraine in the decommissioning of old ammunition, small arms and light weapons stockpiles. In April NATO invited Ukraine to begin an `Intensified Dialogue’ on its aspirations to NATO membership and on the relevant reforms that would be required. The NATO-Ukraine Commission held its first meeting within the framework of the Intensified Dialogue in October, at which Ukraine reaffirmed its wish to join the MAP for aspirant NATO members. In December 2008 NATO ministers responsible for foreign affairs determined to revise the existing NATO-Ukraine Charter in order to reflect the decision made in April of that year with regard to future MAP status. A Declaration to Complement the Charter on a Distinctive Partnership between NATO and Ukraine was signed by both sides in August 2009, with the intention of strengthening political dialogue and co-operation through the existing NATO-Ukraine Commission. A NATO-Ukraine Joint Working Group on Scientific and Environmental Cooperation meets regularly. In February 2013 it was announced that Ukraine had joined NATO’s then ongoing counter-piracy Operation Ocean Shield, off the Horn of Africa. In October Ukraine deployed a naval ship to the Operation, representing the first contribution to the Operation by a partner nation.</p>
               <p usage="ewyb edio eerca">In March 2014, meeting at the request of the interim authorities in Ukraine, the NAC condemned Russia’s escalation of military activities in Crimea (hitherto a Ukrainian autonomous territory), and stated grave concern over the recent authorization by the Russian legislature of the use of armed forces on the sovereign territory of Ukraine. The NAC declared the referendum on secession from Ukraine, held in Crimea on 17 March, to be an illegal violation of the Ukrainian Constitution and of international law. On 1 April, formal co-operation with Russia was suspended by NATO ministers responsible for foreign affairs. Political dialogue, at ambassadorial level and above, was to continue within the NRC framework, and it was envisaged that co-operation projects related to Afghanistan would proceed unaltered. Meanwhile, NATO determined to intensify its support for strengthening Ukraine’s long-term security—including assisting with the modernization of Ukraine’s armed forces, and promoting increased participation by Ukraine in Alliance military exercises—and, in general, to deepen co-operation with its partners in Eastern Europe. In early June NATO ministers of defence, meeting in Brussels, determined, in view of the continuing Russia-Ukraine crisis, further to strengthen the Alliance’s collective reassurance measures. The Secretary-General subsequently urged Russia fully to withdraw its military forces from the Ukraine border area, to act to halt the flow of weaponry and combatants into Ukraine, to encourage Ukrainian armed separatists to disarm and to renounce violence, and to co-operate with the ongoing efforts of the Ukraine authorities to promote peace, unity and reform. In mid-July he expressed profound shock and sadness at the crash of a Malaysia Airlines passenger flight (MH17) in Ukraine. In August the Secretary-General condemned the entry—without the permission of the Ukrainian authorities, and without involvement by the International Committee of the Red Cross—of a Russian humanitarian convoy into Ukrainian territory, declaring this to be a clear breach of Russia’s international commitments, and a further violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty. He also expressed concern at a recent major escalation in Russian military involvement in eastern Ukraine. He stated that transfers of significant quantities of advanced weaponry (including tanks and artillery) to separatist groups in eastern Ukraine, and a marked increase in Russian ground and air forces in the vicinity of Ukraine, had been observed. Soon afterwards NATO’s Allied Command Operations released satellite imagery demonstrating military engagement by Russian combat forces on Ukraine’s sovereign territory. At the end of August an extraordinary meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Commission, called at the request of the Ukrainian Government, condemned in the strongest terms Russia’s continued disregard of its international obligations. NATO refused to recognize the legitimacy of parliamentary elections held in Crimea in mid-September. Meeting in December the NATO-Ukraine Commission condemned violations by Russia of the Minsk Protocol, concluded in September, in Minsk, Belarus, by the Ukrainian and Russian Governments, and opposition militia, and providing for a ceasefire and the initiation of a political process aimed at resolving the crisis. In February 2015 NATO’s Secretary-General expressed support for the conclusion by the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany of a Package of Measures for the Implementation of the Minsk Agreements, referred to as Minsk II, which was aimed at revitalizing the ceasefire. In June 2016 NATO defence ministers approved a Comprehensive Assistance Package (CAP) for Ukraine in order to support reforms aimed at building stronger security structures. In the following month a meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Commission at the level of heads of state and of government reiterated full support for the Minsk Agreements and for the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission deployed to Ukraine to monitor and calm the conflict, and welcomed the adoption in June by the Ukrainian authorities of the NATO principles-based Strategic Defence Bulletin, a roadmap for defence reform.</p>
               <p usage="eerca">Meanwhile, at the end of July 2014 the NATO Secretary-General stated that the USA had briefed the NAC that Russia was in violation of its obligation under the 1988 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty not to possess, to produce, or to flight-test a ground-launched cruise missile with a range capability of 500 km-5,500 km, or to possess or produce launchers of such missiles. The September Wales (UK) summit meeting of NATO heads of state and of government reaffirmed the Alliance’s ongoing suspension of all practical civilian and military co-operation with Russia, and supported sanctions imposed against that country—in view of its destabilizing actions against Ukraine—by the EU, G7 and other international groupings. In October 2015 the NAC expressed deep concern over escalating Russian military activity in Syria, with particular reference to attacks by the Russian Air Force on Hama, Homs and Idlib, on the grounds that these had not targeted Islamic State, and had caused casualties among the civilian population. The Council urged Russia to promote a political solution to the conflict in Syria, and to use military force to target solely Islamic State and to halt attacks on the Syrian opposition and civilians. The Council also protested against recent Russian violations of Turkish airspace. In late November an extraordinary meeting of the NAC emphasized solidarity with Türkiye following the shooting down of a Russian plane that had entered its airspace.</p>
               <p usage="eerca">
        The July 2016 meeting of NATO heads of state and of government (and Montenegro) noted the continuing impact of destabilizing actions and policies by Russia, citing the annexation of and Russian military build-up in Crimea; destabilization of eastern Ukraine; violation of sovereign borders by force; incursions into NATO airspace; provocative military operations near NATO borders, including in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Baltic and Black Sea areas; and military intervention in Syria. NATO leaders reaffirmed, accordingly, the suspension of practical and military co-operation with Russia, the deployment of a forward presence in eastern Alliance territories, and willingness to pursue political dialogue and to maintain military lines of communication with Russia. A meeting of the NRC convened in July 2016 addressed the need fully to implement the Minsk Agreements on Ukraine; the outcomes of the recent Warsaw Summit; and the situation in Afghanistan. A proposal was put forward by the Russian delegation aimed at enhancing air safety in the Baltic Sea area. In December the NRC meeting addressed, 
        <i>inter alia</i>
        , transparency and minimizing the risk of misunderstanding and miscalculation during military activities. The NATO delegation emphasized the destabilizing impact of the excessive use of `snap’ military exercises held without forewarning, noting the need to adhere to the rules governing the notification and observation of such exercises that are enshrined in the OSCE Vienna Document. Participants in the meeting recommended that the NRC should contribute to updating the Vienna Document.

        In July 2017 then President Petro Poroshenko of Ukraine requested the initiation of discussions on developing an action plan that might pave the way for Ukraine’s eventual accession to NATO membership. The inaugural meeting of a NATO-Ukraine Platform on Countering Hybrid Warfare was convened in October; the Platform aimed to strengthen Ukraine’s capacity to resist hybrid threats (including terrorist and hacking attacks, and hostile media campaigns). In July 2018, at the Brussels meeting of NATO heads of state and of government, NATO leaders and Ukraine condemned ongoing human rights abuses and discrimination by the 
        <i>de facto</i>
         Russian authorities in Crimea, including against Crimean Tatars, Ukrainians and members of other distinct ethnic, religious or political groupings. They urged Russia and the 
        <i>de facto</i>
         authorities in Ukraine to grant international monitoring organizations access to Crimea, as well as to free Ukrainian detainees held in Russia, Crimea and in those parts of eastern Ukraine that remained under the control of Russia-supported militants. Russia’s recent construction of the Kerch Strait Bridge connecting Russia and Crimea was condemned as a further violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.

               <p usage="ewyb edio eerca">
        In mid-March 2018 the NAC determined to reduce the size of the Russian mission to NATO and to expel hitherto accredited staff, in response to a recent attack perpetrated in Salisbury, UK, against a retired Russian military intelligence officer and his daughter, using a military-grade nerve agent developed in Russia. The attack was alleged by the UK Government to have been conducted with the knowledge of the Russian authorities (they, however, strongly denied this), and represented the first offensive use of a nerve agent on NATO territory. In May—in view of the conclusion by a Joint Investigation Team (a co-operative undertaking between the Netherlands, Malaysia, Ukraine, Australia and Belgium) that a Russian missile launcher had been used in the July 2014 shooting down of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17—NATO reiterated its full support for the investigation. (In November 2022, following a trial in the Netherlands initiated by Dutch public prosecutors, two Russians and one Ukrainian separatist were found guilty, 
        <i>in absentia,</i>
        of murdering all of the plane’s passengers and crew and were sentenced to life terms of imprisonment; their arrests were ordered.)
      </p>
               <p usage="edio ewyb eerca">In November 2018, at the request of Ukraine, a meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Commission was held to address escalating tensions in the Kerch Strait, where recently Russia had opened fire against and seized the crews of three Ukrainian vessels. NATO called on Russia to allow Ukraine freedom of navigation in the Kerch Strait and Sea of Azov, and to ensure unhindered access to Ukrainian ports. NATO also urged the immediate release of the captured naval personnel, emphasizing that the use of military force against Ukrainian ships and their personnel was not warranted. It reiterated that Russia must end its support to militant groupings active in Ukraine and withdraw all its forces from that country’s territory, and that Russia’s illegitimate annexation and subsequent militarization of Crimea was unacceptable. NATO noted that the Russia-Ukraine crisis had led to the ongoing punitive sanctions regime against Russia, and also drew attention to the recent significant reinforcement of the Allies’ collective defence capabilities. This position was emphasized by a statement on Crimea released by the NAC in March 2019. In June 2020 the NAC designated Ukraine as an Enhanced Opportunities Partner under the Partnership Interoperability Initiative. In July Ukraine participated, with sea, air, land and amphibious forces from 12 NATO Allies, in NATO’s annual Black Sea `Sea Breeze’ exercises. During that year NATO delivered medical supplies and extended financial assistance to help Ukraine counter the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
               <p usage="ewyb edio eerca">In December 2018 NATO ministers responsible for foreign affairs declared that Russia had developed and deployed a (`9M729’) missile system that violated the 1998 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty and posed a considerable risk to Euro-Atlantic security. On 1 February 2019, in response to Russia’s violation, the USA suspended its obligations under the Treaty (full withdrawal took effect in August); on the following day President Putin announced that Russia had also formally suspended its participation, and would develop new missiles. In May 2020 the NATO Secretary-General stated continued support for the 1992 Open Skies Treaty, following an announcement by the US Administration that it was to withdraw its participation given Russian non-compliance; the withdrawal took effect in November. In January 2021 Russia formally announced its impending withdrawal. In late May the new US Administration of Joe Biden informed Russia that it would not rejoin. On 2 June the Russian Duma (parliamentary assembly) passed legislation that provided for Russia’s withdrawal from the Treaty.</p>
               <p usage="ewyb edio eerca">In February 2021 the NAC welcomed the extension by a further five years, until 5 February 2026, of the term of the Treaty on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms (known as the New START Treaty), which had been in effect between the Russian Federation and the USA since February 2011. (The New START Treaty had replaced a previous START Treaty, which was in force between the two countries between 1994-2009.) In October 2021 NATO expelled eight members of Russia’s Belgium-based mission to the organization, describing them as undeclared intelligence officers. In response the Russian authorities decided that from 1 November the accreditation of personnel at NATO’s mission in Moscow would be withdrawn, and that liaison and information offices hitherto maintained by NATO in Moscow were to be closed.</p>
               <p usage="ewyb edio eerca">At a NATO-Ukraine Commission meeting held in April 2021 concern was stated over Russia’s intensified military presence in and around Ukraine and over violations by Russian-supported militants of the ceasefire in eastern Ukraine. (An agreement on measures to strengthen the ceasefire regime had entered into effect in late July 2020.) Calling on Russia to de-escalate the situation, the NATO Secretary-General emphasized that Russia’s annexation of Crimea would not be recognized by the NATO allies. In December 2021 the NAC expressed grave concern at the build-up of Russian troops and military equipment close to the Ukrainian border, and insisted that the Alliance would respond to any aggression against its members or allied partners. Russia’s President Putin, meanwhile, issued a demand that membership of NATO should not be extended to any former Soviet states, and that the Alliance should halt military co-operation initiatives in eastern Europe. A session of the NATO-Ukraine Commission was held on 10 January 2022 to discuss the escalating crisis. The first meeting of the NRC in more than two years was convened on 12 January as a platform to address the situation in Ukraine and wider security concerns. NATO demands for a de-escalation of the build-up of border troops and respect for Ukraine’s territorial integrity were reiterated, as were Russian proposals that NATO withdraw troops and equipment from former Soviet bloc Alliance members and guarantee that the Alliance would not be further enlarged. In mid-January the NATO Communications and Information Agency and Ukrainian authorities signed an updated Memorandum of Agreement to govern continuing co-operation on technology-related initiatives.</p>

        In late January 2022 the NATO Secretary-General confirmed that NATO had sent a series of written proposals to Russia, ideally to be addressed within the NRC framework, that focused on advancing NATO-Russia relations; Euro-Atlantic regional security (including the situation in and around Ukraine); and risk reduction, arms control, and transparency. On 24 February Russia, with Belarusian support, invaded Ukraine. (See main

        In late January 2022 the NATO Secretary-General confirmed that NATO had sent a series of written proposals to Russia, ideally to be addressed within the NRC framework, that focused on advancing NATO-Russia relations; Euro-Atlantic regional security (including the situation in and around Ukraine); and risk reduction, arms control, and transparency. On 21 February the NATO Secretary-General condemned a decision by the Russian authorities to grant formal recognition to the self-proclaimed `Donetsk People’s Republic’ and `Luhansk People’s Republic’ (eastern Ukraine). An extraordinary session of the NATO-Ukraine Commission convened on the following day also deplored the move. An extraordinary session of the NAC was convened on 24 February, called for by Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia in the context of Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty, in response to Russia’s full-scale military invasion of Ukraine earlier in that day. The Council strongly deplored Russia’s act of aggression, and also condemned Belarus for enabling Russia’s assault on Ukraine. The Council called on Russia immediately to cease its military action, to withdraw its forces from Ukraine, to respect international humanitarian law, and to allow unhindered safe humanitarian access to all affected civilians. The Council confirmed that Allied defence plans were being activated, including the deployment of defensive land, air and maritime rapid response reinforcements to the Alliance’s eastern zone. An extraordinary summit of NATO heads of state was held in a virtual format on 25 February, with invited participation by the leaders of Finland, Sweden and the EU, to address `the gravest threat to Euro-Atlantic security in decades’. The summit deplored the loss of life and the destruction ongoing in Ukraine, and called on Russia to withdraw its military forces immediately, noting that Russia would be held accountable globally as an aggressor, and Belarus as Russia’s enabler. The summit emphasized that the regime of Russian President Putin was focused beyond Ukraine and had demanded legally binding agreements that would prevent further enlargement of NATO, while calling for troops and military infrastructure to be withdrawn from the territories of all Allies that had gained membership since 1997. The summit committed to continuing to assist Ukraine, and to strengthening (rather than reducing, as demanded by Russia) support for, 
        <i>inter alia</i>
         Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia and Moldova. Meanwhile, in response to the participation by the Finnish and Swedish leaders in the summit, Putin threatened that `military consequences’ would ensue for Finland and Sweden, should they join NATO. In mid-March an extraordinary meeting of NATO ministers responsible for defence determined to continue to support Ukraine through the provision of military supplies, as well as financial and humanitarian assistance, and to implement measures to strengthen NATO’s collective security. An in-person extraordinary summit meeting was convened on 24 March. Leaders announced that, in addition to the recent deployment of an intensified military presence in eastern zones, four new multinational battlegroups would be stationed in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia. The transformation of NATO to adapt to the new gravely dangerous strategic reality would now be effected, including through enhanced collective exercises, and a strengthening of situational awareness, of cyber capabilities, of capacity to deter disinformation, of civil preparedness, and of readiness to repel biological, chemical, radiological and nuclear threats.

               <p usage="eerca">Meeting in Brussels in early April 2022—with participation by representatives of Finland, Sweden, Georgia, the EU, Australia, Japan, the Republic of Korea (South Korea) and New Zealand—NATO ministers responsible for foreign affairs determined to enhance support to Ukraine, to extend tailored assistance to regional partners under pressure from Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, and also to assist partners in the Asia-Pacific impacted by the global impacts of the ongoing crisis. The Allies stated support for an international investigation to be conducted into the murders of civilians in Bucha and other Ukrainian locations recently liberated from Russian control. They also approved a Charter underpinning the new DIANA network of technology innovation centres. In mid-May NATO foreign ministers, again convened in Brussels, discussed possible accession to the Alliance by Finland and Sweden; formal applications for membership were submitted simultaneously by Finland and Sweden on 18 May. Türkiye indicated opposition to this development. During May an intensive series of NATO military exercises was conducted in member states, from the Baltic region to the Balkans. In June a trilateral memorandum was concluded between Finland, Sweden and Türkiye, in which the two applicant countries made commitments (including on the extradition of suspected terrorists) with respect to Türkiye’s security concerns relating to the separatist Kurdistan Workers’ Party—Partiya Karkeren Kurdistan.</p>
               <p usage="eerca">At a summit of NATO heads of state and of government that was held in Madrid, Spain, in June 2022, Finland and Sweden were formally invited to join the Alliance. Recognizing that a fundamental shift in defence and deterrence was needed to respond to the new security reality, which was to require increased defence investment, a new Strategic Concept was endorsed by the summit. This included strengthening the Alliance’s forward defences, enhancing battle groups in its eastern areas, transforming the NRF by mid-2024 into a stronger, more versatile multinational and multi-domain Allied Reaction Force (ARF), and increasing the number of NATO high readiness forces to more than 300,000 troops. Russia was identified as the `most significant and direct threat’ to the security and stability of the Euro-Atlantic area, and `systemic competition’ was noted from China: it was noted that a strategic partnership was developing between Russia and China, and that both states were at the vanguard of an authoritarian challenge to the rules-based international order. Longer-term military and financial support for Ukraine was agreed, and a NATO Innovation Fund was launched, to advance the use of new technology in strengthening international security. The European Union (EU) was deemed a `unique and essential’ partner for NATO in supporting international peace and security. On 5 July 2022 accession protocols for Finland and Sweden were signed by the NATO member states’ Permanent Representatives; ratification of the protocols was then required by the member states’ national legislatures.</p>
               <p usage="eerca">In early September 2022 the NAC strongly condemned a recent cyber attack—believed to have been perpetrated by Iran—against Albania’s national information infrastructure. On 23 September the NAC denounced a manoeuvre by the Russian authorities to stage in regions of Ukraine that were under or partly under Russian military control—i.e. Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhya and Kherson—non-democratic `referenda’ on accession to the Russian Federation. A recent Russian decision to enforce a partial national military mobilization was noted as an escalation of the war against Ukraine. Furthermore, `irresponsible nuclear rhetoric’ by Russia was condemned. Towards the end of the month the NAC stated deep collective concern at recent apparent sabotage, in international waters in the Baltic Sea, to the Nordstream 1 and Nordstream 2 gas pipelines that run from northeastern Russia to western Europe. The Council emphasized that the ensuing gas leaks posed a risk to shipping and to the environment. On 30 September, in contravention of international law, Russia’s President Putin signed decrees that purported to incorporate Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhya and Kherson into Russia. On the same day Ukraine submitted a formal application for NATO membership. The NATO Secretary-General termed Russia’s annexation of Ukrainian territory illegal and the most serious escalation thus far of the conflict.</p>
               <p usage="eerca">In mid-November 2022 an emergency meeting of the NAC was convened to address an explosion on the previous day in eastern Poland, close to the border with Ukraine, which had reportedly killed two Polish civilians. The meeting concluded that no deliberate attack had been undertaken and preliminary investigations indicated it had been caused by Ukrainian air defence systems. In late November NATO’s ministers responsible for foreign affairs and their Finnish and Swedish counterparts, gathered in Bucharest, Romania, condemned Russia’s `reckless nuclear rhetoric’, ongoing energy blackmail and subversion of the rules-based international order; and reaffirmed solidarity with Poland and their resolute will to support Ukraine’s post-war reconstruction and reform process.</p>
               <p usage="eerca">In early February 2023 the NAC noted with concern a decision by Russia at that time to suspend its participation in (and legally-binding obligations under) the New START Treaty, emphasizing that the treaty made an important contribution to international stability. NATO Allies and also Japan undertook a co-ordinated humanitarian operation to deliver humanitarian aid to Türkiye, in response to devastating earthquakes that struck southern areas of that country in February. In that month 16 NATO allies and Finland and Sweden agreed to join a new Alliance Persistent Surveillance from Space (APSS) initiative. A Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell was established in February at NATO’s headquarters, and in March a new NATO-EU Task Force on Resilience of Critical Infrastructure was initiated, to defend against Russia’s weaponization of energy supplies. In mid-March, following a meeting with his Finnish counterpart, Türkiye’s President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan announced that, as Finland had taken `authentic and concrete’ measures to address Türkiye’s security concerns (as agreed in the June 2022 Trilateral Memorandum), ratification of that country’s NATO application would proceed through the Turkish legislature; this was effected at the end of March 2023. On 4 April Finland formally deposited its instrument of accession as the 31st NATO member state. In early June the NAC condemned a decision by Russia to withdraw from the CFE Treaty on 7 November. In late June, in response to a short-lived mutiny against Russia’s military high command by the Wagner Group (a Russian private paramilitary and security contractor), NATO’s Secretary-General observed that the Russian leadership’s use of mercenary forces exemplified the scale of its strategic mistake in waging war on Ukraine.</p>
               <p usage="eerca">The 2023 summit of NATO heads of state and of government was held on 12 July, in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius. The leaders determined to establish a NATO Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure, within NATO’s Maritime Command. At that time the inaugural meeting was convened, with participation by the NATO leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, of the NATO-Ukraine Council, a new format for bilateral consultations. It was affirmed that Ukraine would eventually accede to NATO, and that the usual requirement for a MAP would be waived. A new assistance package for Ukraine was agreed, aimed at upgrading national equipment and protocols, and enabling full interoperability between Ukrainian and NATO forces: a formal membership invitation was to be issued to the country once those conditions were achieved, and the agreement of all Allies secured. The NATO leaders also met with their counterparts from Australia, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and the EU, and the value of co-operation between NATO, EU and Indo-Pacific partners was emphasized.</p>
               <p usage="eerca">In October 2023, in response to damage perpetrated against critical undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea, NATO intensified surveillance and reconnaissance flights in the area. A Digital Ocean Vision, aimed at enhancing NATO’s maritime situational awareness, from the seabed to space, was endorsed at that time by the Allied ministers responsible for defence. Meanwhile, Russia determined at that time to revoke its ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (which had been effected in 2000)—to ensure parity with the USA, which had signed but not as yet ratified the treaty; relevant legislation was then accelerated through Russia’s legislature. The inaugural ministerial-level meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council was convened in November 2023. It was reported at the end of December that NATO air forces across Europe had scrambled on more than 300 occasions during 2023 to intercept Russian military aircraft nearing Alliance airspace (predominantly over the Baltic Sea).</p>
               <p usage="eerca">At an ambassadorial-level meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council that was held in early January 2024, at Ukraine’s request, the Allies reaffirmed commitment to providing Ukraine with large-scale military, economic, and humanitarian assistance during the year ahead, including a focus on enhancing Ukraine’s air defences. In mid-January a meeting of the NATO Military Committee, plus Sweden, confirmed that the new ARF would be headquartered from mid-2024 (on an interim basis) in Italy. After a protracted delay Türkiye finally approved Sweden’s Accession Protocol in late January 2024. Hitherto, Hungary’s endorsement of Sweden’s accession had been deferred. (In March 2023 a Hungarian government spokesperson had cited as the cause of the postponement grievances over criticism by the Swedish Government of the political agenda of the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.) In January 2024, at the time of Türkiye’s advancement of Sweden’s accession process, Orbán—who had assured the other Allies that Hungary would not prevent Sweden from joining NATO—issued an invitation to his Swedish counterpart, Ulf &#160;Kristersson, to visit the Hungarian capital, Budapest, to discuss the situation. In late February, in Budapest, Orbán and Kristersson concluded a new bilateral military deal. The Hungarian legislature approved Sweden’s Accession Protocol and that country’s President signed it on 5 March. Sweden deposited its instrument of accession with the US Administration on 7 March, marking its formal admission as NATO’s 32nd member state.</p>

               <heading usage="ewyb edio eerca">NATO-Georgia Commission (NGC)</heading>
               <p usage="ewyb edio eerca">In August 2008 an extraordinary meeting of the NAC, convened to discuss an escalation of conflict in Georgia, expressed solidarity with Georgia's actions to counter attacks by separatist forces in Abkhazia and South Ossetia and deplored as disproportionate the use of force by Russia. The NAC subsequently established the NGC, to strengthen co-operation and political dialogue between the two sides and to oversee Georgia's future application for NATO membership. The NAC also agreed that NATO would support Georgia in assessing damage to civil infrastructure, as well as in re-establishing an air traffic system and advising on cyber defence issues. The NGC—which held its inaugural meeting in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, in September—comprises Georgia and all NATO member states, and convenes regularly at the level of ambassadors and military representatives, periodically at the level of foreign and defence ministers and chiefs of staff, and occasionally at summit level. A NATO Liaison Office was inaugurated in Tbilisi in October 2010. In October 2013 the NATO Secretary-General noted with concern the construction by Russia of fences and other obstacles along administrative boundary lines within Georgia, deeming this to be provocative, and urging their removal. He also urged Russia to reverse its recognition of the South Ossetia and Abkhazia regions of Georgia as independent states. NATO refused to recognize parliamentary elections held in South Ossetia in June 2014. In September the Wales, UK, summit meeting of Alliance heads of state and of government determined to extend to Georgia (as well as to Moldova) the implementation of a new Defence and Related Security Capacity Building Initiative, and endorsed a Substantial NATO-Georgia Package (SNGP) that included defence capacity building, training, strengthened liaison, and enhanced opportunities for interoperability. Georgia was to make forces available to the NRF in 2015. (This was achieved in October of that year.) Georgia also offered its participation in the NATO training mission `Resolute Support’, deployed from 2015-21 in Afghanistan. In March 2015 the NATO Secretary-General reaffirmed the status of South Ossetia and Abkhazia as integral parts of Georgia and urged Russia to reverse its recognition of those territories as independent entities. A NATO-Georgia Joint Training and Evaluation Centre was inaugurated at the Krtsanisi Military Facility, Georgia, in August. A NATO-Georgia military exercise—`Noble Partner’ (described by Russia as `provocative’)—has been regularly undertaken at the Vaziani military base, near Tbilisi, since 2016. In July of that year the NGC approved increased support for military training and education in Georgia, provisionally to be financed through a new trust fund, and for strategic communications. The SNGP was upgraded in late 2020. In January 2021 the NATO Secretary-General stated that key joint priorities were secure communications; training and exercises; and enhancing maritime support and situational awareness. Under NATO’s Partnership Interoperability Initiative (q.v.) Georgia is an `Enhanced Opportunities Partner’. The April 2008 decision to invite Georgia to apply for MAP status has been reconfirmed by subsequent summits of NATO heads of state and of government.</p>
               <p usage="ewyb edio eerca">Meeting in early April 2022 NATO ministers responsible for foreign affairs gave consideration to further enhancing the SNGP—for example with respect to secure communications, cyber defence and situational awareness—to support Georgia in building resilience, in the context of the regional threat posed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p>

               <p usage="ewyb edio">NATO’s Mediterranean Dialogue was established in 1994. The Madrid summit meeting in July 1997 endorsed the establishment of a Mediterranean Co-operation Group to enhance NATO relations with Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia. The Group was to provide a forum for consultation between the two groupings and to promote co-operation in training, scientific research and information ex­change. Algeria joined the Dialogue in February 2000. At a meeting held in April 2006 between the NAC and representatives of the seven Mediterranean Dialogue countries, the latter were encouraged to formulate Individual Co-operation Programmes (ICPs) as a framework for future co-operation. In November a NATO Training Co-operation Initiative was inaugurated, extending defence and specialist training and expertise to Mediterranean Dialogue and ICI partner countries in order to help them to strengthen their defence structures and to enhance the interoperability of their armed forces with those of the Alliance.

          <p id="WB02059.IO.TXT.79.1" usage="edio casee">During the 1990s NATO increasingly developed its role as a mechanism for peacekeeping and crisis management. In June 1992 NATO ministers responsible for foreign affairs, meeting in Oslo, Norway, announced the Alliance's readiness to support peacekeeping operations under the aegis of the then CSCE on a case-by-case basis: NATO would make both military resources and expertise available to such operations. In July NATO undertook a maritime operation in the Adriatic Sea to monitor compliance with the UN Security Council's resolutions imposing sanctions against the Yugoslav republics of Serbia and Montenegro. In December NATO ministers responsible for foreign affairs expressed the Alliance's readiness to support peacekeeping operations under the authority of the UN Security Council. </p>

               <p usage="casee">From April 1993 NATO fighter and reconnaissance aircraft began patrolling airspace over Bosnia and Herzegovina in order to enforce the UN prohibition of military aerial activity over the country. In addition, from July NATO aircraft provided protective cover for UN troops operating in the `safe areas' established by the UN Security Council. In February 1994 NATO conducted the first of several aerial strikes against artillery positions that were violating heavy weapons exclusion zones imposed around `safe areas' and threatening the civilian populations. Throughout the conflict the Alliance also provided transport, communications and logistics to support UN humanitarian assistance in the region.</p>
               <p id="WB02059.IO.TXT.80.1" usage="casee">The peace accord for the former Yugoslavia, which was initialled in Dayton, Ohio, USA, in November 1995, and signed in Paris, France, in December, provided for the establishment of a NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR) to ensure compliance with the treaty. In December a joint meeting of allied foreign and defence ministers endorsed the military structure for the mission, entitled Operation Joint Endeavour, which was to involve approximately 60,000 troops from 31 NATO and non-NATO countries. IFOR, which constituted NATO's largest military oper­ation, formally assumed responsi­bility for peacekeeping in Bosnia and Herzegovina from the UN on 20 December. In December 1996 NATO ministers responsible for foreign affairs approved a smaller follow-on operation, with an 18-month mandate, to be known as the Stabilization Force (SFOR). Its principal objective was to maintain a safe environment at a military level to ensure that the civil aspects of the Dayton peace accord could be fully implemented, including the completion of the de-mining process, the repatriation of refugees, and rehabilitation of local infrastructure. The force strength of SFOR was gradually reduced as the security situation in the country improved. The June 2004 summit meeting determined to termin­ate SFOR’s mandate at the end of 2004, and endorsed a new EU mission, EUFOR, in Bosnia and Herzegovina. NATO maintains a military headquarters in Sarajevo, in order to continue to assist the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina in matters of defence reform.</p>
               <p id="WB02059.IO.TXT.82.1" usage="casee">In March 1998 an emergency session of the NAC was convened at the request of the Albanian Government, which was concerned at the deteriorating security of its border region with the Serbian province of Kosovo and Metohija. In June NATO ministers authorized the formulation of plans for air strikes against Serbian targets. In mid-October, following Security Council condemnation of the humanitarian situation in Kosovo, the NAC agreed on limited air strikes against Serbian targets. At the same time the US envoy to the region, Richard Holbrooke, concluded an agreement with President Milošević to implement the conditions of a UN resolution (1199). A 2,000-member international observer force, under the auspices of the OSCE, was to be established to monitor compliance with the agreement, supported by a NATO Co-ordination Unit, based in the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia (FYRM, now North Macedonia, q.v.), to assist with aerial sur­veillance. A NATO Kosovo Verification Command Centre was established in Kumanovo, north-east FYRM, in November.</p>
               <p id="WB02059.IO.TXT.84.1" usage="casee">On 24 March 1999 an aerial offensive against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (which was renamed Serbia and Montenegro in 2003 and divided into separate states of Montenegro and Serbia in 2006) was initiated by NATO, with the declared aim of reducing that country's capacity to commit attacks on the Albanian population. In early April 1999 NATO ambassadors agreed to dispatch 8,000 troops, as an ACE Mobile Force Land operation, to provide humanitarian assistance to the estimated 300,000 refugees in Albania at that time and to provide transportation to relieve overcrowded camps, in particular in border areas. Refugees in the FYRM were to be assisted by the existing NATO contingent (numbering some 12,000 troops), which was permitted by the authorities in that country to construct new camps for an estimated 100,000 displaced Kosovans. An additional 1,000 troops were transferred from the FYRM to Albania in mid-May in order to construct a camp to provide for a further 65,000 refugees. NATO's 50th anniversary summit meeting, held in Washington, DC, in April, issued a statement declaring the deter­mination of all Alliance members to increase economic and military pressure on President Milošević to withdraw forces from Kosovo, and agreed to prevent shipments of petroleum reaching Serbia through Montenegro. On 9 June a Military Technical Agreement was signed between NATO and the Federal Republic of Yugo­slavia, incorporating a timetable for the withdrawal of all Serbian security personnel. On the following day the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1244, which authorized an international security presence in Kosovo, the Kosovo Peace Implementation Force (KFOR), under NATO command, and an international civilian presence, the UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). The NAC subsequently suspended the air strike campaign, which, by that time, had involved some 38,000 sorties. An initial 20,000 KFOR troops entered Kosovo on 12 June. A few days later an agreement was concluded with Russia, providing for the joint responsibility of Pristina airport with a NATO contingent and for the participation of some 3,600 Russian troops in KFOR, reporting to the country command in each sector. On 20 June the withdrawal of Yugoslav troops from Kosovo was completed, providing for the formal ending of NATO's air campaign. KFOR's immediate responsibility was to create a secure environment to facilitate the safe return of refugees, and, pending the full deployment of UNMIK, to assist the reconstruction of infrastructure and civil and political institutions. In addition, NATO troops were to assist personnel of the international tribunal to investigate sites of alleged violations of human rights and mass graves. In January 2000 NATO agreed that the Eurocorps defence force would assume command of KFOR headquarters in April. In February, following an escalation of ethnic conflict in northern Kosovo, an emergency meeting of the NAC determined to reinforce KFOR's troop levels. In October KFOR worked with OSCE and UN personnel to maintain a secure environment and provide logistical assistance for the holding of municipal elections in Kosovo. During the year KFOR attempted to prevent the movement and stockpiling of illegal armaments in the region. In February 2008 Kosovo's newly elected government issued a unilateral declaration of independence from Serbia, supported by many EU countries. NATO’s Secretary-General and NAC at that time reaffirmed the commitment to maintain a force in Kosovo and to support any future arrangements.</p>
               <p usage="ewyb edio casee">Since 2008 NATO has supported the development of the Kosovo Security Force (KSF), a multi-ethnic, lightly-armed crisis response force, with responsibility for conducting civil protection operations that are outside the remit of the Kosovo police—such as explosive ordnance disposal, clearance of hazardous materials, search and rescue operations, and fire-fighting—and supporting the civil authorities in responding to natural disasters. In June 2009 NATO ministers responsible for defence announced a gradual reduction in its Kosovo Peace Implementation Force (KFOR, established in 1999) troop numbers, given improvements in the security environment. NATO and KFOR were, within the scope of their mandates, to offer support towards the implementation of an Agreement on Normalization, that was concluded in April 2013 between Kosovo and Serbia. In July of that year the NAC declared that the KSF, then numbering around 2,200 personnel, had reached full operational capability and was fully trained, to NATO standards, to perform the tasks assigned by its mandate. NATO was to continue to provide advice and support to the Force through an Alliance Liaison and Advisory Team. The schedule of KFOR troop reductions has been assessed continuously by the NAC in accordance with the security situation on the ground, rather than being deadline-driven. In April 2014 NATO reopened Kosovo’s upper airspace (closed since the 1999 conflict) to civilian air traffic flights; the Kosovo airspace was to remain under the authority of NATO/KFOR. In December 2018 the Assembly of Kosovo adopted legislation that provided for significant long-term reforms to the mandate, role and strength of the KSF; promulgating the legislation later in that month the Kosovo authorities emphasized Kosovo’s right to have a professional multi-ethnic army. The NATO Secretary-General stated regret at the decision and at its timing, while Serbia designated it an act of `political aggression’. </p>
               <p>In May 2023 it was announced that 700 additional troops would be deployed to KFOR, in response to violent protests by Kosovan Serbs in (Serb-majority) northern Kosovo. The unrest had been prompted by the assumption of office of several ethnic Albanian mayors, further to municipal elections that had taken place in the previous month but had been largely boycotted by the Kosovan Serb community (which was demanding more autonomy). In response to an attack perpetrated by armed Serbs against the Kosovo Police in September, further troop reinforcements were deployed to KFOR. As at February 2024 there were 4,623 troops under NATO command in Kosovo (compared with 3,747 in October 2022, and with some 15,500 in January 2009), from 28 NATO and KFOR partner countries.</p>

               <p usage="ewyb edio">In August 2003 NATO undertook its first mission outside of the Euro-Atlantic area when it assumed command of the UN-mandated ISAF in Afghanistan. In October the office of a NATO Senior Civilian Representative was established to liaise with the Afghan government and representatives of the international community. In December NATO ministers responsible for defence agreed to extend ISAF's mission in Afghanistan beyond the capital, Kabul. A revised operational plan was endorsed by NATO ministers responsible for foreign affairs in December 2005. Operations were to be extended to cover the entire country and an additional 15 Provincial Reconstruction Teams, five regional commands and two forward support bases (in Kandahar and Khost) were to be established. Additional ISAF officers were dispatched to mentor and liaise with national army units, support government programmes to disarm rebel groups and support government and international programmes to counter illicit narcotic production. In September 2006 NATO’s Secretary-General signed a declaration with the Afghan President establishing a Framework for Enduring Co-operation in Partnership, committing NATO to long-term support for the country's efforts to secure democratic government and territorial integrity. In April 2009 heads of state and of government, and leaders of partner countries contributing to ISAF, attending the NATO summit, declared their long-term commitment to that country, pledged the deployment there of additional military forces for electoral support and for training and mentoring the Afghan National Army. Further initiatives to enhance the training for Afghan National Security Forces, to improve the command and control structure of ISAF and to deploy NATO airborne warning and control aircraft to Afghanistan, were approved by NATO defence ministers meeting in June. A NATO Training Mission in Afghanistan (NTM-A) was formally established in October. In February 2010 ISAF initiated a joint military offensive with Afghan national security forces in order to reassert government authority and to protect the civilian population in southern Helmand province. A joint framework for transition to full Afghan ownership of its national security by the end of 2014 was endorsed at the NATO summit meeting in November 2010. The 2012 NATO summit, held in May, determined to initiate the planning process for a new mission (`Resolute Support’) that was to continue training, advising and assisting the Afghan security forces, within the context of the Framework for Enduring Co-operation in Partnership and at the behest of the Afghan Government, following the 2014 transfer of power. A ceremony in Kabul in June 2013 marked the final transfer of command for security operations from ISAF to Afghan national security and military forces, and, following the termination of ISAF in December 2014, Resolute Support was deployed, across the country, from 1 January 2015. In April 2020 the NAC welcomed the prospect of the initiation of intra-Afghan talks, following the conclusion in February of an agreement between the USA and Afghan Taliban that was focused on achieving peace through negotiations. A statement released in July by the NAC emphasized that an Afghan-owned peace process was the only way to achieve lasting national security, reiterated NATO’s commitment to supporting this, and stressed that present levels of violence were stalling the proposed intra-Afghan negotiations process. In mid-April 2021 the NAC determined that a four-month withdrawal of NATO forces from Afghanistan would commence on 1 May; the Afghan security forces were, however, to continue to be supported, and a NATO civilian presence was to be maintained in Kabul. Upon the departure of the NATO forces the situation on the ground in Afghanistan transformed dramatically, as the Afghan National Army (ANA) proved unable to prevent a very rapid expansion of Taliban militant control over provincial centres and key strategic corridors. On 13 August the NAC met to discuss the crisis; the Secretary-General subsequently stated concern over the Taliban’s highly violent offensive, including targeted killings, other grave abuses of human rights, and attacks on civilians, and restated commitment to supporting a negotiated political solution to the Afghan conflict. On 15 August the Taliban authorities, having swiftly captured Afghanistan’s other cities, took control of the capital, Kabul, and, stated their intent to declare an Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. The incumbent Afghan President, Mohammad Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai, fled the country. The situation was discussed by an extraordinary meeting of the NAC that was held on 20 August, in a virtual format. In late August the Secretaries-General of NATO and of the UN participated in a virtual meeting of the Group of Seven (G7) leaders of major advanced economies to address the situation in Afghanistan. The meeting concluded that ensuring the safe evacuation of nationals and also of Afghan citizens who had provided assistance to the allied NATO forces, and supporting the ongoing international humanitarian response in the region should be prioritized. Continuing steadfast commitment to the Afghan people was affirmed.</p>

               <p id="NATO.IO.999.1" usage="ewyb edio">In June 2004 NATO heads of state and of government, meeting in İstanbul, agreed to offer assistance to the newly inaugurated Iraqi Interim Government with the training of its security forces. Consequently, a NATO Training Implementation Mission was initiated in the following month. In December the NAC authorized an expansion of the Mission, of up to 300 personnel, and the establishment of an Iraq Training, Education and Doctrine Centre. The NATO Training Mission-Iraq (NTM-I) expanded its remit in 2010 to include training of border personnel, but was terminated in December 2011. In April 2011 Iraq was granted NATO partner status. It was announced in May 2012 that a NATO Transition Cell had been established in Iraq to support the development of the partnership. In July 2015, at the request of the Iraqi authorities, the NAC approved a package of defence capacity building measures that were to support Iraq in priority areas that included security sector reform, demining, and civil military and military medicine planning. From early 2016 NATO dispatched mobile NATO security sector reform teams to Iraq. From April NATO provided training, in Jordan, to Iraqi officers. In July the Alliance agreed to provide training, strategic advice and capacity building efforts within Iraq: these activities commenced in January 2017, alongside the Jordan-based training initiative. In July 2018, at the request of the Iraqi Government (which had declared victory over the terrorist group Islamic State in December 2017), NATO heads of state and government authorized a new NATO Mission Iraq (NMI), with a focus on training; the NMI was established in October 2018. In early January 2020 NATO temporarily suspended the mission’s activities, for safety reasons, following the assassination, on Iraqi soil, by a US air strike, of General Qassem Soleimani, commander of the elite Quds Force unit of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps. Meanwhile, the global coalition against Islamic State suspended its combat operations in Iraq to focus on protecting its bases. On 6 January the Iraqi legislature passed a non-binding resolution demanding that foreign military forces withdraw from Iraq and cease using its land, waters and airspace. At that time the NAC, meeting at ambassadorial level, under the chairmanship of NATO’s Secretary-General, expressed its strong ongoing support for the NMI, and for the collective fight against Islamic State and other terrorist groups, and emphasized NATO’s readiness to resume training and capacity-building activities in future. In February 2021 NATO ministers responsible for defence determined to strengthen and expand the NMI from some 500 to 4,000 personnel, on the basis of a request by the Iraqi Government, in particular to counter the ongoing threat from Islamic State.</p>

Later in that month NATO members determined to enforce the UN-sanctioned no-fly zone over Libya, alongside a military operation to prevent further attacks on civilians and civilian-populated areas, undertaken by a multinational coalition under British, France and US command. A few days later, on 27 March, NATO member states agreed to assume full command of the operation to protect civilians in Libya (formal transfer of command took place on 31 March). In late October, following the capture by opposition forces of the last remaining government-controlled city, Sirte, and the arrest (and subsequent death) of the Libyan leader, Col Muammar al-Qaddafi, the NAC resolved to conclude the Operation with effect from the end of that month.</p>

In the following month Operation Active Endeavour was formally launched, to undertake surveillance and monitoring of maritime trade in the region and to detect and deter terrorist activity, including illegal trafficking. In March 2004 the NAC determined to expand the operation to the whole of the Mediterranean and to seek the support of this extension, through their active participation in the operation, by participants in the EAPC and the PfP programme. An Exchange of Letters between NATO and Russia, concluded in December 2004, facilitated the implementation from February 2006 of joint training activities. In September NATO authorized the participation of a Russian naval ship in the operation. The NAC approved the active involvement of a Ukrainian ship in the operation in May 2007. In November 2016 Operation Active Endeavour was transformed into the non-Article 5-mandated Operation Sea Guardian—a broader maritime security operation, covering further tasks, such as countering terrorism and trafficking, supporting situational awareness, and supporting regional capacity building.

          <p>Some 28 NATO-affiliated Centres of Excellence (CoEs) provide training on intelligence and security matters for experts and leaders from NATO member and partner countries. The third annual CoE conference was convened in May 2022, in Brussels.</p>

          <p usage="casee">As NATO is an international, not a supra-national, organization, its member countries themselves decide the amount to be devoted to their defence effort and the form which the latter will assume. Thus, the aim of NATO's defence planning is to develop realistic military plans for the defence of the Alliance at reasonable cost.</p>
          <p>In September 2014 NATO heads of state and government made a Defence Investment Pledge, in which they emphasized the NATO guideline of a minimum level of national defence expenditure amounting to at least 2% of GDP, and determined that this should be achieved across the organization by 2024, and also agreed to ensure a more balanced sharing of costs and responsibilities. Members contribute to the Alliance on the basis of a cost-sharing formula. The NATO civil budget for 2024 amounted to €438.1m. (a notable increase over the allocations in 2023 and 2022 of, respectively, €370.8m. and €289.1m.). The military budget for 2024 was €2,030m. (12% higher than the 2023 allocation). In 2023 Poland’s defence expenditure, at 3.9% of its GDP, was estimated to be proportionately the highest of all member states, followed by the USA (3.5%).</p>
          <p usage="casee">Under the annual defence planning process, political, military and economic factors are considered in relation to strategy, force requirements and available resources. The procedure for the co-ordination of military plans and defence expenditures rests on the detailed and comparative analysis of the capabilities of member countries. All installations for the use of international forces are financed under a common-funded infrastructure programme. In accordance with the terms of the Partnership for Peace strategy, partner countries undertake to make available the necessary personnel, assets, faci­lities and capabilities to participate in the programme. The countries also share the financial cost of military exercises in which they participate. In 2023 Poland’s defence expenditure, at 3.9% of its GDP, was estimated to be proportionately the highest of all member states.</p>
          <!--~ Between 2007 (taken as the pre-crisis baseline) and 2013 the share of US NATO expenditures increased from 68% to 73%, while the European share decreased-->
