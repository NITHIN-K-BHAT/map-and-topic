          <p id="BSEC.IO.3">OAPEC was established in 1968 to safeguard the interests of members and to determine ways and means for their co-operation in various forms of economic activity in the petroleum industry. In 2022 OAPEC member states accounted for 53.6% of total proven global crude oil reserves and 25.9% of total global reserves of natural gas. OAPEC member states contributed some 28.2% of total world crude oil production and 14.6% of total global marketed natural gas in that year.</p>

      OAPEC co-ordinates different aspects of the Arab petroleum in­dustry through joint undertakings. It co-operates with the 
      <xr pageref="N" ref="LAS.IO">League of Arab States</xr>
       (Arab League) and other organizations, and works to link petroleum research institutes in the Arab states. OAPEC collabor­ates with the Arab League and its subsidiary Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (AFESD) and Arab Monetary Fund in compiling the normally annual 
      <publ-name>Joint Arab Economic Report</publ-name>
      . OAPEC maintains the OAPEC Energy Data Bank, and an online library, and provides training in technical matters and in documentation and information. The General Secretariat also con­ducts tech­nical and feasibility studies and carries out market reviews.
    </p>
          <p>
      In August 2020 OAPEC issued a report on the use of Liquefied Natural Gas as an environmentally preferable marine fuel substitute (in place of high sulphur fuel oil). An OAPEC study titled 
      <publ-name>Plastic Waste Recycling, Investment Opportunities and Environmental Solutions</publ-name>
       was also issued in that month.
    </p>
          <p>In association with AFESD, OAPEC organizes the quadrennial Arab Energy Conference, attended by OAPEC ministers responsible for petroleum and energy, senior officials from other Arab states, and representatives of invited institutions and organizations concerned with energy issues. The 12th Conference, hosted by Qatar in December 2023, in Doha, issued a Final Statement that recommended means of meeting energy sector-related challenges, including balancing the continued exploitation of hydrocarbon sources with embracing clean technologies to control emissions, and integrating environmental concerns into development plans. OAPEC, with other Arab organizations, participates in the Higher Co-ord­ination Committee for Higher Arab Action. An OAPEC Award for Scientific Research is granted every two years.</p>
          <p usage="edio">OAPEC was a founding member (in 1982) of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, affiliated with the University of Oxford. A joint meeting aimed at boosting co-operation between OAPEC and the Institute was convened in September 2021.</p>
