      The ninth International Conference of American States (held in Bogotá, Colombia, in 1948) adopted the Charter of the Organization of American States, creating a successor to the Commercial Bureau of American Republics, founded in 1890, and the Pan-American Union. The OAS aims, 
      <i>inter alia,</i>
       to strengthen the peace and security of the continent; to promote human rights and consolidate representative democracy; to promote, through co-operative action, the economic, social and cultural development of member states; and to confront shared problems such as poverty, terrorism, the trade in illegal drugs, and corruption.

               <heading>Defending Human Rights</heading>
               <p>Under the Inter-American Democratic Charter `respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms' is deemed to be an essential element of a democracy. The IACHR and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights are the `pillars’ of a system designed to protect individuals in the Americas who have suffered violations of their rights.</p>
               <p usage="edio sacac">A key function of the IACHR is to consider petitions from individuals who claim that a state has violated a protected right and that they have been unable to find justice. The Commission brings together the petitioner and the state to explore a `friendly settlement'. If such an outcome is not possible, the Commission may recommend specific measures to be carried out by the state to remedy the violation. If a state does not follow the recommendations the IACHR has the option to publish its report or take the case to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, as long as the state involved has accepted the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction. The IACHR convenes for six weeks each year.</p>
               <p usage="sacac">In addition to hearing cases the Court may exercise its advisory jurisdiction to interpret the human rights treaties in effect in the region. The IACHR, for its part, may conduct an on-site visit to a country, at the invitation of its Government, to analyse and report on the human rights situation.</p>
               <p>The OAS works beyond the inter-American human rights system to promote the rights of vulnerable groups. In June 2016 the 46th General Assembly adopted the American Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The Declaration recognizes the collective organization and multicultural, multilingual character of Indigenous peoples; the self-identification of people who consider themselves indigenous; and the extension of special protection to certain (Amazon-based) groups who are in voluntary isolation from, or initial stages of contact with, the wider world. Since 2018 the second week of August each year has been commemorated by the OAS as Inter-American Week for Indigenous Peoples. OAS sponsored the Seventh Inter-American Week for People of African Descent in the Americas (an annual event) in March 2024, which was focused on the theme `Global Freedom: Emancipate Yourself from Mental Slavery’.</p>

        The Inter-American Commission of Women, established in 1928 (and known by its Spanish acronym: CIM), has advocated for the integration of a gender perspective throughout the OAS agenda, and in member states has contributed to incorporating women's rights into national legislation and policies. The Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence against Women, also known as the Convention of Belém do Pará, was adopted by the OAS General Assembly in 1994. Since 2005 parties to the Belém do Pará Convention have participated in a compliance follow-up mechanism. In June 2020 the OAS helped to compile a report titled 
        <publ-name>Panorama of the legal recognition of gender identity in the Americas,</publ-name>
         which addressed means of formally recognizing the gender identity of individuals in accordance with their private personal perception of it.
      </p>
               <p>The Inter-American Convention against All Forms of Discrimination and Intolerance entered into force in February 2020, and the Inter-American Convention against Racism, Racial Discrimination and Related Forms of Intolerance which entered into effect in November 2017. An Inter-American Convention on Protecting the Human Rights of Older Persons entered into force in January 2017.</p>
               <p>In October 2020 the OAS Secretary-General announced the appointment of a Special Adviser on the Responsibility to Protect, mandated to consider how the organization may systematically strengthen its capacity to counter mass atrocities or crimes against humanity committed in the region. The Special Adviser issued his first report in September 2022; he recommended the creation of an early-warning mechanism to help to prevent such crimes.</p>

               <p>
        OAS supports good governance in its member states through various activities, including electoral observations, crisis prevention missions, political analysis, and programmes to strengthen government institutions and to support a culture of democracy. In September 2001 the member states adopted the Inter-American Democratic Charter, which detailed the essential elements of representative democracy. The 41st General Assembly, held in June 2011, in San Salvador, El Salvador, approved a final Declaration on Citizen Security in the Americas, in accordance with which ministers drafted a related hemispheric plan of action. Since 2010 the OAS, jointly with the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance and Mexican partners, has convened regular Latin American Democracy Forum sessions; the ninth was organized in April 2019, in Mexico City, Mexico, on the theme `Challenges of Politics and Democracy in the Digital Era’. The OAS General Secretariat has supported the Latin American Open Data Initiative (known as ILDA), which promotes the development of national open data policies and strategies in the region. (It was reported in mid-2019 that 58% of OAS member states did not have open data regulations in place.) In 2020 ILDA initiated a regional Open Data Barometer, addressing governments’ publication and use of data. In 2024 the Initiative was undertaking projects relating, 
        <i>inter alia,</i>
         to community, gender and inclusion, developing technologies, and transparency and governance. In June 2022 the OAS established a Center for Media Integrity of the Americas, which aimed to promote independent high-quality journalism and social media on the continent.

               <p>The OAS aims to combat corruption in recognition of the undermining effect this has on democratic institutions. In 1996 the OAS member states adopted the Inter-American Convention against Corruption, which entered into force in 1997, and had by 2024 been ratified or acceded to by all 34 member states. The Follow-Up Mechanism for the Implementation of the Inter-American Convention against Corruption (MESICIC) assesses progress, including through liaison with civil society representatives, and recommends concrete measures that the 34 participating states parties can implement to improve compliance with the treaty’s key provisions. In 2024 MESICIC was conducting a sixth round of member country evaluations. The OAS has also held seminars and training sessions in the region on matters such as improving transparency in government and drafting model anti-corruption legislation. The 2018 Summit of the Americas, held in Lima, Peru, adopted the Lima Commitment on Democratic Governance Against Corruption.</p>
               <p>Civil society organizations (CSOs) are encouraged to participate in workshops and roundtables in advance of the OAS General Assembly, to prepare proposals and recommendations to present to the member states. This is also the case with the Summits of the Americas and the periodic ministerial meetings, such as those on education, labour, culture, and science and technology. By 2024 some 465 CSOs were registered with the OAS, and approximately 600 co-operation agreements had been concluded with civil society entities.</p>
               <p>The observation of elections is given high priority by the OAS. Depending on the specific situation and the particular needs of each country, electoral observation missions (EOMs) vary from a few technical experts sent for a limited time to a large country-wide team of monitors dispatched to observe the full electoral process for an extended period commencing with the political parties' campaigns. The EOMs present their observations to the OAS Permanent Council, along with recommendations for how each country's electoral process might be strengthened. An Inter-American Meeting of Electoral Authorities has been convened periodically since 2003.</p>
               <p usage="edio">In October 2012 the Permanent Council approved a resolution to designate 4 February as OAS Electoral Observation Day, to commemorate 50 years since the first mission was dispatched.</p>
               <p>In the first three months of 2024 OAS EOMs monitored a general election in El Salvador, and municipal elections in Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic (in February); and municipal elections in El Salvador (in March).</p>

          In February 2004 the Permanent Council authorized the establishment of an OAS Mission to Support the Peace Process in Colombia (MAPP). In September 2016, following the adoption of a Government-Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia-Ejército del Pueblo (FARC-EP) peace accord, MAPP’s mandate was expanded to monitor challenges and threats to peace in post-conflict Colombia and the mission was tasked with continuing to work towards establishing favourable conditions for building peace. MAPP’s mandate was extended in October 2021 until December 2024. In June 2022 the IACHR warned that human rights defenders, social leaders, and minorities (including Indigenous and Afro-Caribbean populations) in Colombia faced `structural violence’, noting allegations that firearms had been used indiscriminately by security forces (some of whom were reportedly not fully identified as such) against protesters and onlookers during mass gatherings, particularly in Cali and parts of Valle del Cauca, and in Pereira (Risaralda). In early 2023 MAPP was invited by the Colombian Government to participate in a proposed ceasefire monitoring and verification initiative. In June MAPP reported on initial impacts of the policy of `Total Peace’ initiated by Colombian President Gustavo Petro (who had taken office in August 2022). A report issued by MAPP in November 2023 made a series of recommendations to the Colombian authorities concerning, 
          <i>inter alia,</i>
           humanitarian demining, talks with illegal armed groups, and dismantling armed groups. At March 2024 MAPP was operating through 18 regional offices across Colombia (particularly in remote rural areas).

An OAS EOM also monitored a run-off poll held in October at which Daniel Noboa was elected to the presidency. Violent unrest perpetrated by organized criminal groups escalated in Ecuador in early 2024.

The OAS General Secretariat protested the `instrumentation of justice’ to challenge the democratic electoral process, urging respect for a separation of powers and for the autonomy of the national electoral authority. The second round, held in August, was won emphatically by Arévalo. In that month the OAS EOM to Guatemala released a report that noted interventions by actors seeking to `ignore, delay, or reverse’ the election outcome; to intimidate electoral bodies and technical staff; and to generate uncertainty in the public domain, thereby undermining the democratic process. The EOM stated deep concern in September over a raid by the office of Guatemala’s Public Prosecutor against the national repository of electoral material. In early December the OAS General Secretariat condemned, as a coup attempt, actions and statements of the office of the Public Prosecutor to Public Prosecutor's Office of Guatemala that were deemed to constitute `an alteration of the country's constitutional order, a breach of the rule of law and a violation of the human rights of the population of their country’; the EOM stated that it was rejecting a further attempt by the Public Prosecutor to annul the elections.</p>

In late May 2019 the Core Group stated deep concern at the political, economic, social and security situation in that country, and called for a national debate to be held with the aim of initiating a reform agenda. Legislative elections that were initially to have been held in Haiti in October 2019 were postponed. From late 2019 opposition unrest escalated and demands intensified for the resignation of President Jovenel Moïse—whose rule was conducted by decree from January 2020, at which time the national legislature was dissolved. In September 2020 President Moïse issued a decree that installed all nine members of the Provisional Electoral Council (the previous membership having resigned in July). In March 2021 the Permanent Council established an OAS Good Offices Mission to facilitate a dialogue between all political stakeholders in Haiti and to help to ensure free and fair polling in legislative and presidential elections that were scheduled to take place later in that year. The Council recognized that the security situation in Haiti had become increasingly fragile, exacerbated by the humanitarian crisis resulting from COVID-19. Anti-government violence was widespread, in particular resulting from the intention of President Moïse to hold a constitutional referendum. The OAS Good Offices Mission visited the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince, in early June. On 7 July a special virtual meeting of the OAS Permanent Council vehemently condemned the assassination of President Moïse—perpetrated earlier in that day by armed attackers at his private residence in Pétion-Ville, Port-au-Prince. The Permanent Council emphasized its support for Haiti’s democratic institutions and for dialogue between all national stakeholders. On 20 July Ariel Henry was inaugurated as acting President and acting Prime Minister. At the end of September he dismissed members of the Provisional Electoral Council, thus postponing the national polls that had been scheduled to be held in early November.</p>

          In August 2022 the OAS General Secretariat issued a statement that reiterated previous calls for an end to armed violence in Haiti. The 52nd meeting of the OAS General Assembly, held in October, resolved, 
          <i>inter alia,</i>
           to request the OAS Secretariat and membership to offer direct support to the Haitian Government to combat firearms trafficking, to strengthen the capacity of the Haitian National Police (HNP) and judicial system, to enhance the training of port security staff, and to support the Haitian Government’s ongoing Integrated Recovery Plan for the Southern Peninsula (focused on the reconstruction of earthquake-affected infrastructure), as well as to re-establish a mechanism for regular meetings to follow up the work of the OAS Good Offices Mission to Haiti. An agreement on a National Consensus for an Inclusive Transition and Transparent Elections, signed in December by acting President and Prime Minister Ariel Henry and by opposition and civil society representatives, provided for a 14-month transition that was to include general elections, the inauguration of a newly elected government, and for the establishment of several transitional bodies. In February 2023 the Permanent Council established an OAS Working Group on Haiti. In the following month the General Secretariat convened a Dialogue on Security, Humanitarian, Electoral and Democracy Assistance in Haiti, with participation by representatives of the Haitian Government, the High-Level Transition Council of Haiti, OAS member states and permanent observers and other principal stakeholders.

Eventually, on 1 March 2024, Kenya formally agreed to supply 1,000 officers to the mission. Shortly afterwards Haiti spiralled further into gang-led anarchy: the OAS General Secretariat stated deep concern, while reaffirming the continuing commitment of the organization to addressing the country’s challenges, including democratic instability, food and health insecurity, corruption, unemployment, illiteracy, and the `perpetual violence’ of criminal elements. On 11 March gang elements (which by then had control of around 80% of Port-au-Prince) forced the resignation of Ariel Henry.</p>

Later in that month the IACHR reported that at least 76 people had been killed and 800 injured during the unrest thus far. In June the OAS General Assembly adopted a Declaration of Support for the People of Nicaragua. IACHR established a Special Monitoring Mechanism for Nicaragua (Mecanismo Especial de Seguimiento para Nicaragua—MESENI) in that month, with a mandate to monitor the human rights situation in that country. A complementary Interdisciplinary Group of Independent Experts (GIEI) for Nicaragua was also formed by the IACHR at that time; this was to support ongoing investigations into the violence, and was deployed to Managua, the Nicaraguan capital, from 1 July. In mid-July a special gathering of the OAS Permanent Council was convened to address the continuing crisis in Nicaragua, which had by that time reportedly resulted in the deaths of several hundred opposition protesters. The Council requested the Nicaraguan Government to support an electoral calendar agreed by an ongoing National Dialogue process; it also condemned harassment of Roman Catholic bishops engaged in the National Dialogue, as well as ongoing acts of violence. In August the Permanent Council endorsed the establishment of a Working Group on Nicaragua, mandated to address peaceful and sustainable solutions to the situation; the inaugural meeting of the Working Group was held in September. In mid-December the OAS General Secretariat strongly denounced a recent decision by the Nicaraguan Government to expel the OAS and UN human rights presences from the country. Soon afterwards the Working Group on Nicaragua also condemned, and strongly urged the Nicaraguan authorities to reconsider, the decision to suspend the presence of the MESENI and IACHR visits to Nicaragua, and the abrupt termination of the GIEI. In February 2019 a delegation of the OAS General Secretariat visited Nicaragua, at the invitation of that country’s Government, to participate in exploratory talks. A Special Envoy to Nicaragua was appointed in the following month. In May the OAS Permanent Council adopted a resolution that reiterated concern over the deterioration of democratic institutions and human rights in Nicaragua, as well as support for a peaceful resolution of the ongoing political crisis there. In June the OAS Assembly approved the establishment of an OAS High Level Commission on Nicaragua, with a mandate to pursue a negotiated settlement to the crisis. However, the Nicaraguan authorities subsequently denied the Commission entry into the country. The Commission and Nicaraguan stakeholders met in El Salvador in October, and the Commission recorded a series of complaints and testimonies. It presented a report of its findings to the OAS Permanent Council in the following month. In December 2020 the OAS General Secretariat stated deep concern over the enactment of a Nicaraguan Law for the Defence of the Rights of the People to Independence, Sovereignty and Self-Determination for Peace, stating that this sought to restrict political competition. In May 2021 the OAS Secretary-General expressed his concern at the prospect for free and fair elections, scheduled to be held in November, following the recent approval of electoral reforms and the appointment of government-backed magistrates to the Supreme Electoral Council. In the following month the OAS Permanent Council stated alarm at the deterioration of the political climate and human rights situation in Nicaragua—including harassment, arbitrary arrests and restrictions targeted at opposition candidates and independent media professionals—and called for guarantees to ensure that the planned elections would be held freely and fairly. Following the elections, conducted in early November, the OAS General Assembly declared that they had `no democratic legitimacy’, in view of the suppression of opposition electoral candidates and media, and lack of transparency in voting procedures. The Nicaraguan authorities subsequently submitted notice of withdrawal from the organization, a process that was to take effect in two years. In early December a special meeting of the Permanent Council urged Nicaragua to comply with its commitments under the Inter-American Democratic Charter and to receive an OAS high-level mission to help to secure electoral reforms and political freedoms.</p>
                    <p usage="sacac">In March 2022, in a videographed message to the OAS Permanent Council, the Nicaraguan ambassador to the organization resigned his post and denounced the regime of President Daniel Ortega, accusing it of repressing opposition and human rights. In late April the General Secretariat denounced the occupation by the Nicaraguan authorities of the OAS offices in Managua, undertaken as the Nicaraguan Government unilaterally declared that it had completed its withdrawal from the organization. In August the OAS Permanent Council stated deep concern over a worsening climate of oppression in Nicaragua, characterized by mounting arbitrary arrests and detentions, the seizure of mayoral offices in several opposition-held municipalities, the forced closure of non-governmental organizations, repression of media freedom, and continuing attacks on Roman Catholic religious representatives. The Council called upon the Nicaraguan authorities immediately to release all political prisoners and to guarantee freedom of expression. In October the 52nd OAS General Assembly invited the organization’s member states to establish a high-level commission mandated to support dialogue on all relevant issues. The OAS General Secretariat welcomed the arrival in the USA in February 2023 as refugees of 222 former Nicaraguan political prisoners.

          In October 2022, at the request of the Peruvian Government, the Permanent Council established a High-level Group to analyse the political situation in Peru. At the beginning of December, following a visit to that country in November, the High-level Group issued a preliminary report, which noted several risk factors, including democratic instability (characterized by, 
          <i>inter alia,</i>
           highly fragmented political forces, lack of dialogue between principal political players, numerous cabinet reshuffles, and criminal investigations initiated against President Pedro Castillo and others); a highly polarized national environment; confrontation between political bodies; excessive use of political control mechanisms; queries about the role of the media; a state of social crisis; and racism and discrimination. The Group recommended putting in place a political truce; convening a formal free dialogue process; focusing on constitutional justice; ensuring full respect for human rights; and exercising freedom of expression and of the media in a constructive manner. A meeting of the OAS Permanent Council was to have been convened on 8 December to consider the report. However, on 7 December President Castillo (apparently in an attempt to pre-empt impeachment proceedings against him) unexpectedly declared a national state of emergency, and decreed the temporary dissolution of the national legislature and its replacement by an `exceptional emergency government’. These actions were not accepted by the national constitutional court, military or legislature; the latter voted to impeach Castillo (who was detained), and inaugurated the hitherto Deputy President, Dina Boluarte, as the new President. The OAS Permanent Council subsequently declared its support for Boluarte and her commitment to restoring national unity and democracy. Significant national protests took place, including a mass mobilization organized by Indigenous supporters of Castillo. In May 2023 the IACHR released a report into the unrest, condemning the disproportionate and indiscriminate use of force by state security officers.

Recommendations of the mission included establishing ample and ideally uniform deadlines for the implementation of the postal voting process; the replacement, in certain states, of outdated vote counting machines with ones that would provide a voter-verifiable paper record; promoting the establishment of independent electoral bodies across all states; enhancing the training of electoral workers; enacting stronger legislation on the disclosure of political finance, to enhance the transparency and equity of the electoral process; deterring malicious election-related use of SMS messaging; and promoting more female participation in the electoral process.</p>

          In May 2016, following the imposition of a national state of emergency in Venezuela, relations between the OAS and the Venezuelan regime of President Nicolás Maduro Moros became extremely strained. At the beginning of June the OAS Permanent Council endorsed an initiative to restart an effective dialogue between the Venezuelan author­ities and opposition, and offered OAS support in resolving the political crisis in that country. In April 2017 the OAS Permanent Council resolved to urge the Venezuelan authorities to take action to restore full constitutional authority to the National Assembly and to support measures facilitating a return to democratic order. During that month the Venezuelan Government initiated the process of withdrawing from the OAS. The election to the new National Constituent Assembly took place as planned in late July, and was declared `absolutely void’ by the OAS Secretary-General. In that month the Secretary-General appointed Luís Moreno Ocampo, the Argentine former

The Commission noted that the Venezuelan prison system was in crisis, citing an excessive use of pre-trial detention, severe overcrowding, deplorable conditions, endemic violence, and official corruption. In May the OAS Secretary-General condemned the recent presidential election as illegitimate, and described Maduro’s rule of Venezuela as a `dictatorship’. </p>

          In early 2019 a special meeting of the Permanent Council voted not to recognize the legitimacy of Maduro’s new term in office, commencing 10 January. The Council reiterated deep concern over the deteriorating political, economic, social and humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, while emphasizing the consequent exodus from the country of large numbers of Venezuelans and its impact on other countries in the region. The resolution strongly condemned continuing arbitrary detentions of Venezuelan opposition members. Member states were encouraged to adopt diplomatic, economic, financial and political measures to advance 
          
          the restoration of democratic order in that country. In late January a declaration by Juan Guaidó Márquez, President of the Venezuelan National Assembly, that he had assumed the role of interim President of Venezuela was welcomed by the OAS Secretary-General; 
          <i>inter alia</i>
          , the USA and the European Parliament also declared support for Guaidó. In mid-March the OAS General Secretariat issued a statement condemning the blockade of humanitarian aid by the Maduro regime in Venezuela, as well as violence allegedly perpetrated by forces associated with that regime against Venezuelan demonstrators at the Venezuela-Colombia border and against Indigenous people. Later in that month the Permanent Council adopted a resolution that urged member states, permanent observers, and relevant international agencies to continue to provide support to alleviate the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, and demanded that Venezuelan public institutions refrain from obstructing the entry of humanitarian aid into the country. In April a special session of the Permanent Council recognized the designated envoy of Guaidó as the official representative of Venezuela’s National Assembly, pending new democratic elections. In September the Permanent Council approved a resolution in which it strongly condemned continuing grave and systematic violations of human rights in Venezuela, including illegal and arbitrary detentions, torture, extrajudicial executions, forced disappearances and the denial of basic rights and necessities. Shortly afterwards 12 states parties to the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (q.v.) in the Permanent Council decided to convene the Organ of Consultation of the Treaty, during the second half of September, to address the situation in Venezuela. This represented the first convocation of the Organ since the occasion of the September 2001 major terrorist attacks against the USA. In early January 2020 the OAS General Secretariat condemned a move by the Maduro regime to remove Guaidó from his role as National Assembly President and to recognize a rival head of the legislature. The General Secretariat stated that it found that, during a recent electoral process, Guaidó had been returned as President of the National Assembly in accordance with the law, and it welcomed his continuation in that role, and thus also (in its view) as Venezuela’s legitimate interim national President. 
        </p>
                    <p>In December 2020 the OAS issued a report which found that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the Maduro regime had been responsible for committing crimes against humanity in Venezuela since February 2014, including 18,093 extrajudicial executions and 15,501 incidents of severe deprivation of liberty. A dialogue between the opposition (led by Guaidó) and Maduro regime was initiated in August 2021. At the end of that month opposition parties announced that, with a view to resolving the political stalemate, they would participate in forthcoming regional and municipal elections (held in November, at which Maduro’s Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela, and allied parties, won a majority of votes). In December 2022 opposition politicians voted by 72 to 29 (with eight abstentions) to dissolve the Guaidó-led interim government; this was effected on 5 January 2023. In February the OAS General Secretariat hosted the launch of a report by the Centro de Estudios para América Latina on the human rights situation in Venezuela.

               <heading>Multidimensional Security</heading>
               <p>
        The promotion of hemispheric security is a fundamental purpose of the OAS. The Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance was adopted by member states in September 1947 and entered into force in December 1948. In October 2003, at a Special Conference on Security convened in Mexico City, the member states adopted a Declaration on Security in the Americas, which established a multidimensional approach that recognized a range of security threats, such as international terrorism, conflict, drug trafficking, illegal arms dealing, human trafficking, institutional corruption, organized crime, cyber attacks, extreme poverty and social exclusion, natural and man-made disasters, environmental degradation, disease, and hazardous materials. The OAS maintains a Hemispheric Security Observatory, which includes a data repository on,
        <i> inter alia</i>
        , homicide, other serious crimes, and the criminal justice and prison systems.
      </p>
               <p>The Inter-American Defense Board (IADB), which was formally designated as an OAS agency in March 2006, provides technical and educational advice and consultancy services to the OAS and its member states on military and defence matters. A Conference of Defence Ministers of the Americas (CDMA) is convened every two years.</p>
               <p>The Inter-American Convention against Terrorism, aimed at preventing the financing of terrorist activities, strengthening border controls, and increasing co-operation among law enforcement authorities in different countries, entered into force in July 2003. The Inter-American Committee against Terrorism (CICTE) offers technical assistance and specialized training in key counter terrorism areas including port security; airport security; customs and border security; and legislation and legal assistance. Through the CICTE member countries have also improved co-operation in improving the quality of identification and travel documents, strengthening cybersecurity and adopting financial controls to prevent money laundering and the funding of terrorist activities. It was announced in early October 2019 that an Inter-American Network on Counterterrorism was to be established, within the CICTE framework, as a means of strengthening relevant co-operation and information exchange between states. Later in that month the seventh meeting of ministers responsible for public security in the Americas (`MISPA VII’), was convened, in Quito, Ecuador (the first such meeting having been held in October 2008). In June 2019 the 49th OAS Assembly designated 3 June as the annual Inter-American Day against Terrorism.</p>
               <p>
        The OAS Working Group on Cybercrime of the Meetings of Ministers of Justice, or Other Ministers, or Attorneys General of the Americas holds meetings twice a year. An OAS Observatory of Cybersecurity in Latin America and the Caribbean measures member states’ progress in strengthening cybersecurity through policy and strategy, legal frameworks, technology, and other criteria (such as online privacy standards). A joint OAS-Inter-American Development Bank report, 
        <i>Cybersecurity: Risks, Progress and the Way Forward in Latin America and the Caribbean,</i>
         was issued in July 2020. A Cybersecurity Innovations Councils (CICs) initiative was launched in 2020 by OAS and the digital communications company Cisco Systems Inc., to strengthen the regional cybersecurity infrastructure. In February 2023 OAS helped to organize a Regional Meeting of the Cybersecurity Innovations Councils, in Washington, DC, at which it was decided that a new innovation laboratory would be established, a course on governance and artificial intelligence conducted, and an applied research workshop organized within the CICs framework. The ninth annual `Cybersecurity Summer Boot Camp’ was to be organized in July 2024 by the OAS and Spain.
      </p>
               <p>The Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission (CICAD) seeks to reduce the supply of and demand for illegal drugs, within the framework of a Hemispheric Drugs Strategy and supporting Plan of Action that cover the period 2021-25. The CICAD Executive Secretariat implements programmes aimed at preventing and treating substance abuse; reducing the supply and availability of illicit drugs; strengthening national drug control institutions; improving practices to control firearms and money laundering; developing alternate sources of income for growers of coca, poppy and marijuana; and helping member governments to improve the gathering and analysis of data. An Inter-American Observatory on Drugs has been maintained by CICAD since 2000. The Multilateral Evaluation Mechanism (MEM) measures drug control progress in member states and the hemisphere as a whole, based on a series of objective indicators. Thematic national evaluation reports relating to its eighth round of evaluations were released in December 2022.</p>
               <p>In 1997 the member states adopted the Inter-American Convention against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives, and other Related Materials (known as CIFTA), which by 2024 had been ratified by 31 member states. These countries have strengthened co-operation and information sharing on CIFTA-related issues. In November 2002 an Inter-American Convention on Transparency in Conventional Weapons Acquisition entered into force; it had been ratified by 17 members by 2024.</p>
               <p>The OAS, the Inter-American Development Bank and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development jointly implement the Continuous Reporting System on International Migration in the Americas (SICREMI), which aims rigorously to monitor international migration movements and key policies and programmes being implemented in the region; the fourth SICREMI report was released in December 2017. In December 2016 the Permanent Council adopted a declaration on `Inter-American Co-operation to Address the Challenges and Opportunities of Migration’, in which manifestations of intolerance against migrants were condemned, and commitments were made to combat people smuggling and trafficking in the region, and to address the causes of irregular migration.</p>
               <p>
        In July 2016 the OAS and 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-UN.1443">UNHCR</xr>
         co-chaired a high-level roundtable meeting, in San José, Costa Rica, to address the situation of people fleeing the so-called Northern Triangle (of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, where increasing violence led to significant forced population movements, particularly towards Mexico and the USA). The meeting agreed a series of comprehensive, collaborative actions, issued in the following month as the San José Action Statement, including enhancing protection measures in countries of origin, and the provision of international protection for asylum-seekers and refugees.
      </p>
               <p>A Joint OAS-UNHCR Technical Secretariat assesses the progress of a Comprehensive Regional Protection and Solutions Framework (Marco Integral Regional para la Protección y Soluciones—MIRPS), which was established in 2017 to support the rights of migrants and refugees from or transiting through Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador (which joined MIRPS in 2019), Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and Panama. Each MIRPS country pursues a national action plan and forms strategic alliances with local authorities, civil society, private sector interests, multilateral organizations, and other states, to address the needs of displaced persons and the communities hosting them. The inaugural ministerial meeting of signatories to MIRPS was held in Mexico City, Mexico, in November 2019. In the following month a Support Platform for the MIRPS was launched, with participation by Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, France, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the USA and the EU. A MIRPS Fund was established in May 2020. In June 2023 the 53rd regular OAS Assembly adopted a Declaration for the Protection and Integration of Migrant and Refugee Children in the Americas. In January 2024 the sixth MIRPS annual meeting approved a MIRPS Statutory Charter.</p>
               <p>In September 2018 a special meeting of the Permanent Council established a working group to address means of managing ongoing mass movements of migrants and refugees from Venezuela into the wider region (including the Caribbean). A regional campaign aimed at preventing discrimination and xenophobia against the then 5.1m. exiled Venezuelans in the region was launched by the OAS in mid-2020. In March 2023 the OAS General Secretariat held a meeting that included a focus on international co-operation in response to migration from Venezuela, and the socioeconomic integration of migrants in host countries.</p>
               <p usage="sacac">In June 2023 the 53rd OAS General Assembly adopted a Declaration on the Question of the Malvinas Islands (Falkland Islands); the most recent in a long series of such declarations, which have emphasized the need for the prompt resumption of negotiations between Argentina and the United Kingdom over the status of the islands.</p>
               <p usage="edio">In June 2017 the OAS General Secretariat welcomed the launch of an Asset Recovery Inter-Agency Network in the Caribbean (ARIN-CARIB). ARIN-CARIB had been developed with OAS support, with the aim of promoting co-ordination between Caribbean law enforcement agents and prosecutors in achieving the forfeiture of hidden assets derived from organized crime.</p>
               <p>The Inter-American Convention to Facilitate Disaster Assistance was adopted in 1991. The OAS Secretary-General chairs the Inter-American Committee on Natural Disaster Reduction, which was established in 1999 comprising the principal officers of regional and international organizations concerned with the prevention and mitigation of natural disasters. The Third Hemispheric Meeting of the Inter-American Network for Disaster Mitigation (mandated in 2006 to advance hemispheric collaboration in the area) took place, under OAS auspices, in November 2014 on the theme `Integrating Disaster Risk Management and Adaptation to Climate Change in the Development Agenda’. In October 2014 the OAS convened the inaugural meeting of a Group of Friends on Natural Disaster Mitigation, to promote co-operation among all stakeholders in assisting countries that were vulnerable to natural disasters.</p>
               <p>OAS has mediated between states to alleviate tensions in the region. In exceptional situations, when both or all member states involved in a dispute ask for its assistance, the OAS plays a longer-term role in supporting countries to resolve bilateral or multilateral issues. In June 2000 OAS ministers responsible for foreign affairs established an OAS Fund for Peace: Peaceful Settlement of Territorial Disputes (`Peace Fund’), comprising a General Fund, to finance prompt reaction by the OAS to emerging conflicts, and sub-funds tailored towards specific disputes. Within the Peace Fund framework, an Inter-American Peace Forum undertakes initiatives aimed at promoting a culture of regional peace.</p>
               <p usage="sacac">In June 2016 Belize and Guatemala initiated negotiations, under OAS auspices, aimed at drafting the terms of a co-operation mechanism regarding disputed territory around the Río Sarstún. Both countries subsequently held popular referendums which confirmed support to submit the issue for arbitration to the International Court of Justice.</p>

               <!--American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man; check strategic plan for partnership for integral devt-->
               <p>Combating poverty and promoting social equity and economic development are priority concerns of the OAS, and the OAS pursues these aims in partnership with regional and global agencies, the private sector and the international community. Priority policies and programmes of the Executive Secretariat for Integral Development (SEDI) cover economic development, including trade, culture, tourism, competitiveness, and science, innovation and technology; human development, including education and employment; sustainable development, including water, environment policy, energy, sustainable cities and disaster risk; and port development. SEDI implements an Economically Empowered Women for Equitable and Resilient Societies (Women’s Economic Empowerment—WEE) initiative in Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, El Salvador, Grenada, Guatemala, Honduras, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.</p>
               <p>In June 2012 the OAS General Assembly adopted a Social Charter of the Americas. In February 2015 a Plan of Action of the Social Charter of the Americas was adopted by the Permanent Council. In June 2014 the 44th General Assembly approved the Declaration of Asunción: Development with Inclusion, in which member states determined to focus on `eradicating hunger and poverty, in particular extreme poverty, on combating inequity, inequality, discrimination, and social exclusion, and on increasing equitable access to health services, as well as to quality and inclusive education’ in the Americas. The Declaration urged member states to strengthen their capacities to withstand external shocks, and to incorporate, as appropriate, the results of the post-2015 development agenda into programmes and activities. In June 2018 the General Assembly adopted a resolution on the Incorporation of Multidimensional Criteria for the Measurement of Poverty and Development.</p>
               <p>The fifth Meeting of Ministers and High Authorities of Social Development of the Americas was organized in November 2022, in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, on the theme `Strengthening Hemispheric Cooperation towards Resilient Reconstruction and Sustainable Social Development in the Americas’. (The first such gathering had been convened in July 2008.)</p>
               <p>In June 2020 the OAS Permanent Council and the Inter-American Council for Integral Development convened a (virtual) meeting on analysing resilience in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. In March 2021 the OAS Secretary-General issued a statement on the equitable distribution of vaccines, in which he urged greater funding for the World Health Organization-led vaccine-distribution mechanism. He noted that OAS member states accounted for more than one-half the confirmed COVID-19 cases globally, and that the pandemic crisis had devastated member economies, especially those that were very dependent on external sources of income (such as tourism), and that vaccinating against the disease would benefit both public health and economic recovery.</p>
               <p>The OAS supports member states to cope with trade expansion and economic integration. It provides support in strengthening human and institutional capacities, and in enhancing trade opportunities and competitiveness, particularly for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). It assists member states (especially smaller economies) to develop the capacity they need to negotiate, implement and administer trade agreements and to take advantage of the benefits offered by free trade and expanded markets. Many member states seek assistance from the OAS to meet successfully the challenges posed by increasing globalization and the need to pursue multiple trade agendas. The OAS also administers an Inter-American Foreign Trade Information System, which acts as a repository for information about trade and trade-related issues in the region, including the texts of trade agreements, information on trade disciplines, data, and national legislation.</p>
               <p>The OAS has also focused on strengthening ties with the private sector. Business leaders from the region develop proposals and recommendations to present to the OAS General Assembly and to the Summits of the Americas. An OAS Small Business Development Centers (SBDC) project, supporting local enterprise, had by 2024 facilitated the establishment of SBDCs in Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Jamaica and Saint Lucia. In November 2021 the 51st OAS General Assembly adopted an Inter-American Business Charter.</p>
               <p>In February 2021 a virtual Americas Competitiveness Forum was held to address priorities for the regional post-COVID-19 recovery, with a focus on digital transformation; innovation-led business development; MSME competitiveness and citizenship; enhancing the regulatory environment, trade facilitation and regional value chains; and climate change adaptation. The Seventh Inter-American Dialogue of High-Level MSME Authorities, convened in September, addressed public policies, programmes and solutions to assist MSME’s post-COVID economic recovery.</p>
               <p>OAS conducts environmental and sustainability assessments to help member states to identify key environmental issues. It also assists member states with formulating policies and executing projects that are aimed at integrating environmental protection with rural development and poverty alleviation, and that ensure high levels of transparency, public participation and gender equity. Water resource management projects include initiatives that support member states in managing transboundary water resources in the major river basins of South and Central America, in partnership with the UN Environment Programme, the World Bank and the Global Environment Facility (GEF). The OAS is also active in various international fora that address water-related issues. An Inter-American Congress on the Environmental Rule of Law was held in July 2021, in Mexico City (the inaugural Congress having been convened in March 2015, in Montego Bay, Jamaica). The Inter-American Biodiversity Information Network, which has been supported since 2004 by the GEF, the World Bank and other sources, is a principal focus of OAS biodiversity efforts.</p>
               <p usage="edio sacac">The OAS also supports the work of national conservation authorities in areas such as migratory species and biodiversity corridors. It co-operates with the private sector to support innovative financing through payment for ecological services, and maintains an online portal regarding land tenure and land title, which is used throughout the Americas.</p>
               <p>The OAS serves as the technical secretariat for the Renewable Energy in the Americas initiative, which offers governments access to information on renewable energy and energy-efficient technologies, and facilitates contacts between the private sector and state energy entities in the Americas. The OAS hosts a Technical Co-ordination Unit of an Energy and Climate Partnership of the Americas (ECPA). The sixth Ministerial Meeting of the ECPA was to be hosted by the Dominican Republic, in Punta Cana, in March 2024, on the theme `Renewable Energy in the Americas: Integration and Innovation’. (The inaugural meeting was held in 2010.)</p>
               <p>In April 2022 the Permanent Secretariat convened a meeting to address disruptions to the supply of agricultural fertilizer to the region, attributable to the invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation (a major exporter of the commodity, presently under widespread punitive sanctions).</p>
               <p usage="sacac">A specialized unit for the sustainable development of tourism, which was established in 1996, supports regional and subregional conferences and workshops, as well as the Inter-American Travel Congress—which serves as a forum to consider and formulate region-wide tourism policies. The unit also undertakes research and analysis of the industry. In September 2011 the 19th Inter-American Travel Congress, convened in El Salvador, approved the establishment of a Hemispheric Tourism Fund, which was to support poor communities in developing their tourism potential. The inaugural meeting of an Inter-American Tourism Commission was held in August 2012. In early 2014 OAS, with other partners including the Central American Integration System and the Caribbean Tourism Organization and Sustainable Travel International, launched the Americas Sustainable Destinations (SDAA) initiative, with the aim of strengthening public-private partnerships to protect, and to improve, the lives of local people in, destination areas. In September seven SDAA destinations in Central America and the Caribbean were announced. </p>
               <p>In October 2021 the 25th Inter-American Congress of Ministers and High-Level Authorities of Tourism was convened on the theme `Toward the Reconstruction and Rebuilding of Tourism Post COVID-19’.</p>
               <p>The ninth inter-American meeting of ministers responsible for culture, held in October 2022, in Antigua, Guatemala, adopted the Declaration of Antigua, which addressed the role of creativity and culture in reactivating economic activity.

               <heading>Summits of the Americas</heading>
               <p>Since December 1994, when the First Summit of the Americas was convened in Miami, USA, leaders of the OAS member states have met periodically to examine political, economic and social development priorities and to determine common goals. This process has increasingly shaped OAS policies and priorities and many achievements in the hemisphere, for example the adoption of the Inter-American Democratic Charter and the creation of mechanisms to measure progress against illicit drugs and corruption have been attained as a result of Summit mandates. The Summits of the Americas have provided direction for the OAS in the areas of human rights, hemispheric security, trade, poverty reduction, gender equity and greater civil society participation. A Summit Implementation Review Group manages the Summits process; a Joint Summit Working Group (JSWG) co-ordinates support by inter-American and other international institutions to the process; and a Summits of the Americas Follow-up System co-ordinates the implementation of a framework of action-oriented Summit mandates. The OAS also has responsibility for strengthening outreach to civil society to ensure that NGOs, academic institutions, the private sector and other interests can contribute ideas and help to monitor and implement Summit initiatives.</p>
               <p>The Eighth Summit was held in April 2018, in Lima, with participation by high-level representatives of 33 member states. (The President of the USA did not attend.) The meeting issued the Lima Commitment on Democratic Governance Against Corruption, which addressed combating systemic corruption, and emphasized the need to improve transparency in the digital age. Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela were controversially excluded by the US Administration from the Ninth Summit, which was convened in Los Angeles, in June 2022. El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico chose to be represented by their ministers responsible for foreign affairs. The Ninth Summit issued the (non-binding) Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection, which detailed commitments such as boosting temporary worker programmes for seasonal agricultural labour in Canada and the USA. The Declaration also called for more humane treatment of migrants during processing at border crossings. The 10th Summit was to be held in the Dominican Republic, in November 2025.</p>
