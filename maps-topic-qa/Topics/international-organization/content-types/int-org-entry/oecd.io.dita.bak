          <p id="NEA.IO.CASEE.3">The OECD was founded in 1961, replacing the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation which had been estab­lished in 1948 in connection with the Marshall Plan (developed to stabilize western Europe after World War Two). It constitutes a forum for governments to discuss, develop and attempt to co-ordinate their economic and social policies. The organization aims to promote policies designed to achieve the highest level of sustainable economic growth, employment and increase in the standard of living, while maintaining financial stability and democratic government, and to contribute to economic prosperity and to the expansion of world trade.</p>

        The OECD co-operates significantly with the 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-OTHERORGS.ECANDFIN.002">Group of 20</xr>
         (G20) major economies, with some overlap in membership. The European Commission takes part in the OECD's work and also participates in the G20 format. Brazil, the People's Republic of China, India, Indonesia and South Africa are regarded by the OECD as `key partner' countries. In January 2022 the Ministerial Council determined to initiate accession negotiations with Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Croatia, Peru and Romania; accession roadmaps were adopted in June for the latter five countries. An initial accession dialogue with Ukraine was approved by the Council in October. In June 2023 a four-year country programme was launched for Ukraine, to support reforms and reconstruction in that country, in support of its aim to join the OECD and the European Union.
      </p>
               <p>In February 2022 the OECD Council formally terminated an accession process for the Russian Federation that had been postponed indefinitely in 2014. On 8 March 2022 participation in OECD activities by Russia and Belarus was suspended.</p>

The Council meets (usually once a year) at ministerial level, with the chairmanship rotated among member states. It also meets regularly at official level, when it comprises the Secretary-General and the Permanent Representatives of member states to the OECD. It is respons­ible for all questions of general policy and may establish subsidiary bodies as required, to achieve the aims of the organization. Decisions and recommendations of the Council are adopted by mutual agreement.</p>

        The OECD aims to promote stable macroeconomic environments in member and non-member countries. The Economics Department works to identify priority concerns for governments and to assess the economic implications of a broad range of structural issues, such as ageing, labour market policies, migration, public expenditure and financial market developments. 
        <publ-name>Economic Outlook</publ-name>
        , analysing the major trends in short-term economic prospects and key policy issues, is published twice a year. The main organ for the consideration and direction of economic policy is the Economic Policy Committee, which comprises governments' chief economic advisers and central bankers and meets regularly. The Economic and Development Review Committee, comprising all member countries, is responsible for surveys of the economic situation and macroeconomic and structural policies of each member country. A report, including specific policy recommendations, is issued every 12 to 18 months on each country, after an examination carried out by the Committee.

        In March 2021 the OECD recommended that governments pursue an `all-hazards-and-threats’ approach to building post-COVID-19 pandemic resilience, with a strong focus on international co-operation; aligning innovation systems to policy objectives and challenges; enhancing global collaboration on emerging technology governance; and developing a rapid response mechanism that would ensure the continuation of supply chains of essential goods during any future major global crises. In September the OECD observed that the rollout of vaccines and unprecedented support from central banks and governments had mitigated the pandemic shock. In March 2022 the OECD issued 
        <publ-name>Economic and social impacts and policy implications of the war in Ukraine</publ-name>
        , which noted that the war and consequent imposition of international sanctions against Russia had prompted a spike in energy prices, as Russia was the supplier of around 19% of the world’s natural gas and 11% of oil: in particular, the EU was dependent on Russia at that time for 27% of its crude oil imports, 41% of natural gas imports, and 47% of solid fuel imports. Meanwhile, existing supply chain disruptions were being exacerbated. Emphasizing the need to diversify energy sources (including expediting investment in renewable energy), the OECD recommended that Europe start immediately to build energy security that was independent of Russia. In general, minimizing dependence on Russia for imports was recommended.

        In early 2023 the OECD introduced a regularly updated Dashboard on Short-Term Indicators, presenting the broad recent macroeconomic landscape of the G7 member economies and principal emerging economies. Monthly Composite Leading Indicators (intended to predict economic turning points) continued to be issued for most G20 member states and Spain. In February 2024 the OECD’s interim 
        <publ-name>Economic Outlook</publ-name>
         estimated that in 2023 global economic growth had stabilized at 3.1% and the average rate of inflation in G20 member states was 6.2%—attributed to lower energy prices and more resilient supply chains. Given the ongoing escalation of conflict in the Middle East, geopolitical risks remained high into 2024. Global growth of 2.9% was forecast for the year ahead. The report recommended that governments focus investment on areas most likely to drive sustainable growth—in particular on fostering human capital. Public debt levels were reported to be generally higher than before the 2020-21 COVID-19 pandemic crisis.

               <p>The Development Assistance Committee (DAC) is the principal body through which the OECD deals with issues relating to co-operation with developing countries and is one of the key forums in which the major bilateral donors work together to increase their effectiveness in support of sustainable development. Estonia became the 32nd member of the DAC in June 2023. Bulgaria Kuwait, Qatar, Romania, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are further DAC `participant’ countries. The DAC is supported by the Development Cooperation Directorate, which monitors aid programmes and resource flows, compiles statistics and seeks to establish codes of practice in aid. There are also working parties on statistics, aid evaluation, gender equality and development co-operation and environment; and networks on poverty reduction, good governance and capacity development, and conflict, peace and development co-operation. The DAC holds an annual high-level meeting of ministers responsible for international aid, and heads of aid agencies from member governments, with senior officials from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and UNDP. In 2022 official development assistance exceeded US&#8201;$200,000m. A recommended target of diverting 0.7% of a donor country’s gross national income towards international aid, first agreed in 1970, has been subsequently consistently endorsed.</p>

        The Competition Committee promotes the harmonization of national competition policies, co-operation in competition law enforcement, common merger reporting rules and pro-competitive regulatory reform, the development of competition laws and institutions, and efforts to change policies that restrain competition. The OECD promotes inter­national trade in financial services and encour­ages the integration of non-member countries into the global financial system. The Insurance Committee monitors structural changes and reform measures in insurance markets, for example the liberalization of insurance markets, financial insolvency, co-operation on insurance and reinsurance policy, the monitoring and analysis of regulatory and structural developments, and private pensions and health insurance. A working party on private pensions meets twice a year. In November 2019 the OECD recommended that governments urgently reform national pension systems to take into account the circumstances of temporary, part-time and self-employed workers, who represented at that time one-third of the total labour force in OECD member states. Specialized work on public debt is undertaken by the Working Party on Government Debt Management. An OECD Global Forum on Public Debt Management and Emerging Government Securities Markets is normally convened each year. The

In May 2009 the OECD Council adopted a Recommendation on the Non-Tax Deductibility of Bribes and in December adopted a Recommendation for Further Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in order to strengthen the existing legal framework for combating bribery and corruption. A fourth phase of related country evaluations was being conducted during 2016-24. In May 2018 OECD member states and partner countries adopted the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct.

               <p>The OECD promotes internationally accepted standards and practices of taxation, and provides a forum for the exchange of information and experience of tax policy and administration. Focal areas addressed by OECD’s Centre for Tax Policy and Administration include aggressive tax planning; base erosion and profit shifting; consumption taxes; dispute resolution; exchange of information; tax policy analysis; tax treaties; tax and crime; and transfer pricing. The OECD Network on Fiscal Relations examines fiscal connections between central and subcentral governments. The OECD administers a network of Multilateral Tax Centres that provide workshops and a venue for exchanges between national officials and OECD experts. The OECD’s Forum on Tax Administration (FTA) provides a discussion platform for commissioners from member and non-member (including G20) countries. The Forum’s subsidiary JITSIC (established in 2004, and renamed in 2014 as the Joint International Tax Shelter Information and Collaboration Network) facilitates further collaboration between FTA member administrations. In addition, the OECD convenes an annual Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes to promote co-operation and dialogue with non-member countries. In July 2014, in response to a request from the G20, the OECD Council approved a new Common Reporting Standard, in accordance with which jurisdictions obtain information from financial institutions and automatically exchange it, on an annual basis, with other jurisdictions.</p>

In October 51 jurisdictions, gathered in Berlin, Germany, adopted a Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement governing the implementation of the CRS. By January 2024 this had 100 signatories. More than 3,300 bilateral relationships were active concerning the automatic exchange of so-called country-by-country (CbC) reports, in which all large multinational companies are required to present aggregate data on the global allocation of income and profit, taxes paid and economic activity among all the tax jurisdictions in which they operate.</p>

        In July 2013, at the request of the G20, the OECD initiated a Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action Plan aimed at strengthening corporate taxation systems and combating tax avoidance by multinational enterprises. In November 2014 the G20 endorsed the establishment of an ad hoc negotiating group, hosted by the OECD, to develop a multilateral instrument to modify existing tax treaties in accordance with BEPS objectives; the group was inaugurated in May 2015. The resulting Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS was adopted in November 2016 and entered into force on 1 July 2018; as at January 2024 it was in effect in 85 states. In November 2015 G20 heads of state and of government endorsed a BEPS package of 15 actions to reform the international tax system. An OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS, enabling participation by non-member countries and jursidictions committed to the implementation of the BEPS action plan, was established in the following year. In May 2019 a BEPS programme of work was adopted that was to focus on formulating a global agreement aimed at resolving multinational enterprise taxation challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy. An initial set of proposals was published in October, and a series of public consultations on related issues was subsequently initiated. On 1 July 2021 130 countries and jurisdictions adopted a political statement agreeing the establishment of a new two-pillar framework for the reform of international taxation rules, involving placing multilaterally agreed limits on tax competition, with the aim of ensuring that, in the modern digitalized and globalized economy, multinational enterprises pay a fair share of tax wherever they operate. Pillar One aimed to ensure a more equitable distribution of profits and taxing rights with regard to major multinationals, including digital companies; and Pillar Two focused on the introduction of a global minimum corporate tax rate that would enable the protection of national tax bases. It was envisaged that the framework would support countries’ post-COVID recovery. In early October 136 countries and jurisdictions (accounting for more than 90% of global GDP, and including all OECD and G20 member states), formally approved an updated final Statement on the Two-Pillar Solution to Address the Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalisation of the Economy, providing for multinational enterprises to be subject to a minimum 15% tax rate, following the formulation and adoption of a related multilateral convention (the `Multilateral Convention—MLC to Implement Amount A of Pillar One’). In December 2021 the OECD released a rulebook: 
        <publ-name>Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalisation of the Economy—Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules (Pillar Two),</publ-name>
         to guide the domestic implementation of the minimum 15% tax rate. A G20/OECD Roadmap on Developing Countries and International Taxation Update was issued in July 2023 (the initial version of the Roadmap having been published in October 2022). A proposed text of the planned MLC was issued in October 2023.

The meeting approved a Declaration on Government Access to Personal Data held by Private Sector Entities which, complementing OECD’s Privacy Guidelines, aimed to tighten rules in order to safeguard privacy and human rights freedoms (referred to as `data free flow with trust’—DFFT). In March 2024 the OECD reported that the member states with the greatest high-speed fibre coverage (reported to be the dominant technology since 2021) were the Republic of Korea (where fibre technology accounted for 89% of broadband connections as at mid-2023), Japan (86%), Iceland (85%) and Spain (84%). Across the whole OECD area fibre accounted for 41% of subscriptions at mid-2023.</p>

               <p>The Employment, Labour and Social Affairs Committee is concerned with the development of the labour market and selective employment policies to ensure the utilization of human capital at the highest possible level and to improve the quality and flexibility of working life, as well as the effectiveness of social policies. The Committee's work covers such issues as the role of women in the economy, industrial relations, measurements of unemployment, and the development of an extensive social database. The Committee also carries out single-country and the­matic reviews of labour market policies and social assistance systems. It has assigned a high priority to work on the policy implications of an ageing population and on indicators of human capital investment.</p>

               <p>The OECD views education as a lifelong activity. The Directorate for Education and Skills focuses on the thematic areas of early childhood and schools; skills beyond schools; innovation in education; and research and knowledge management. Programmes undertaken by the Directorate include a Programme for Co-operation with non-member Economies, the Programme on Institutional Management in Higher Education and the Programme on Education Building, as well as regular Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) peer reviews of education systems. The eighth PISA review round, covering performance across 81 countries during 2022, and reported on in November 2023, found an unprecedented drop in performance across the OECD member states, in comparison with 2018. This was attributed in part to disruptions to education caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. A Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies was launched in 2011.</p>

               <p>The OECD’s Global Relations Secretariat guides interaction with non-member states. In 2024 the OECD was maintaining 17 global forums to address transboundary issues: the most recent to be established were (in 2022) a Global Forum on Building Trust and Reinforcing Democracy and the Global Forum on Technology. Regional initiatives were also in effect covering Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia; Asia; the Middle East and North Africa; and Latin America. The Sahel and West Africa Club, established in 1976, is a platform for informal discussion between OECD members and representatives of stakeholder international organizations, West African regional organizations, and development partner countries. In January 2021 the OECD established the OECD İstanbul Centre, which was to expand co-operation with partner economies, with a view to strengthening the post-COVID-19 global economic recovery.</p>
               <p usage="edio">The OECD supports an Africa Global Partnership Platform, endorsed in 2014 by African Union heads of state and of government to foster greater coherence in Africa’s international partnerships, and to serve as a platform for connecting African perspectives into global processes.</p>
               <p usage="casee">The Support for Improvement in Governance and Management (SIGMA) programme, which aimed to assist the reform of public institutions in the transition economies of Central and Eastern Europe and North Africa and the Middle East, is jointly conducted with the EU.</p>
               <p usage="edio casee">Non-member economies may be invited to participate in or observe the work of certain OECD bodies. In 1994 the OECD Centre for Private Sector Development, based in İstanbul, commenced operations as a joint project between the OECD and the Turkish Government to provide policy advice and training to administrators from transitional economies in Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Transcaucasus. Subsequently, the Centre has evolved into a regional forum for policy dialogue and co-operation with regard to issues of interest to transitional economies. The OECD has collaborated with the Joint Vienna Institute, which offers a variety of administrative, economic and financial management courses to participants from transition economies.</p>
               <p>Key partner countries participating in the OECD’s Enhanced Engagement Initiative (launched in 2007)—Brazil, China, India, Indonesia and South Africa—are encouraged to participate directly in the work of the organization and are important partners in dialogue.</p>

               <p>The IEA works to strengthen the security of energy supplies and foster stability in world energy markets. It promotes co-operative efforts to conserve energy, to accelerate the development of alternative energy sources, to strengthen research and development of new energy technologies, and to remove legis­lative and administrative obstacles to increased energy supplies. The agency promotes international collaboration in the development of energy technology, through effective transfer of knowledge, technology innovation and training. The following are areas of focus: renewable energy (solar photovoltaic—PV, wind, bioenergy, hydroelectricity), fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, oil); low-emission fuels (biofuels, hydrogen, electrolysers); and electricity (electrification, nuclear power, smart grids and grid-scale storage). The IEA Technology Collaboration Programme (TCP) comprises international groups of experts that provide a framework for global co-operation and information exchange on specific topics (buildings, electricity, industry, transport, renewable energy, fossil energy, and fusion power).</p>
               <p>The IEA Energy Data Centre collects, processes and disseminates statistical data and information on all aspects of the energy sector, including production, trade, consumption, prices and greenhouse gas emissions. The Agency promotes co-operation among policymakers and energy experts to discuss common energy issues, and to enhance research and development and energy technology. The Centre also provides online training.</p>
               <p>Member states are required to stock a strategic reserve of crude oil equivalent to 90 days of the previous year's net imports. These measures, which also include demand restraint, were to take effect in disruptions exceeding 7% of the IEA or individual country average daily rate of consumption. At December 2023 Australia was not in compliance with the 90 day rule, having the equivalent of 55 days of petroleum import coverage. Three IEA members—Canada, Mexico and Norway—are net exporters of petroleum.</p>
               <p>IEA member states have collectively made available to the market additional supplies of petroleum from their emergency reserves, to guarantee continuation of supplies, on the following occasions: in the run-up to the 1991 Gulf War; in September-December 2005, in response to concerns about interruptions to the supply of petroleum from the Gulf of Mexico, following extensive hurricane damage to oil rigs, pipeline and refineries; in June 2011, in response to disruption of oil supplies from Libya; and in March and April 2022, in response to the invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation (a significant supplier of natural gas and petroleum to the global market). The IEA undertakes emergency response reviews and conducts biennial Emergency Response Exercises (EREs), to facilitate a co-ordinated response to a severe disruption in petroleum supplies.</p>
               <p>In March 2022 the IEA Secretariat released a 10-Point Plan to support European countries in minimizing their reliance on Russian gas supplies. An IEA ministerial meeting held in March adopted new mandates, including ensuring energy security during the energy transition, and leading the global energy sector in combating climate change—including by expanding the Agency’s work on the critical minerals required for clean energy technologies. A special IEA ministerial meeting was convened in February 2023 to address means of continuing to strengthen natural gas supply security. In June the Governing Board determined to end collective actions in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p>

        In May 2021 the IEA, which has elaborated a Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) Scenario, published the first edition of a comprehensive roadmap to transform the global energy sector to net-zero by 2050. A special report on strategies to manage the dependency on coal and existing coal assets during the transition to net-zero was published by the agency in November. In September 2023 the IEA issued 
        <publ-name>Net Zero Roadmap: A Global Pathway to Keep the 1.5 °C Goal in Reach</publ-name>
        , an update of the roadmap issued in May 2021. In March 2024 the IEA and

               <p>The IEA’s flagship Clean Energy Transitions Programme (CETP), initiated in 2017, covers policy advice, technical co-operation, data and analytical work, and strategic and political dialogue. Under a Joint Commitment agreed in March 2022 by the IEA member states and the EU, the CETP was to receive annual funding of €20m. until 2030. Programmes on Clean Energy Transitions in Emerging Economies and People-Centred Clean Energy Transitions (promoting inclusivity) are also implemented. An IEA Global Observatory on People-Centred Clean Energy Transitions was launched in February 2024. An IEA Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) Projects Database is maintained.</p>

        The IEA’s annual publication 
        <publ-name>World Energy Investment</publ-name>
         forecast in May 2023 that annual global investment in clean energy technologies would reach US&#8201;$1,700,000m. in that year. The Agency’s 
        <publ-name>Renewable Energy Market Update</publ-name>
        , issued in June, envisaged that—prompted by the ongoing energy security concerns—global renewable capacity would rise in 2023 to more than 440 GW, a record level; PV and wind energy output were reported to be particularly robust. 
      </p>
               <p>Since 2016 the IEA has organized an annual Global Conference on Energy Efficiency. The fourth session, held in June 2019, launched a Global Commission for Urgent Action on Energy Efficiency. At the eighth session, held in Versailles, France, in June 2023, participating governments endorsed the goal of doubling the average global rate of energy efficiency improvements by 2030. The ninth session was to take place in Nairobi, Kenya, in May 2024.</p>

        The IEA’s 
        <publ-name>World Energy Outlook 2023,</publ-name>
         issued in October, reported that renewable energy sources accounted for around 30% of the global power mix, and forecast that by 2030 this proportion would rise to around 50%. It envisaged that by 2030 the number of electric cars in global use would have increased ten-fold and that sales of heat pumps and other electric heating systems would have outpaced fossil fuel boilers. It also predicted that by 2030 global liquefied natural gas (LNG) supply would have expanded by 45%.
      </p>
               <p>The IEA holds bilateral and regional technical meetings and conducts surveys and reviews of the energy situation in non-member countries. It has provided technical assistance for the development of national energy legislation, regulatory reform and energy efficiency projects.</p>
               <p>The informal IEA Energy Business Council, established in 2009 and comprising executives of leading international companies, meets twice a year to assess energy markets and policy. It is the principal broad mechanism through which the IEA interacts with industry.</p>

        The NEA's mission is to assist its member countries in maintaining and further developing the scientific, technological and legal bases required for the safe, environmentally sound and economical use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. It maintains a continual survey with the co-operation of other organizations, notably the 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-UN.1837">International Atomic Energy Agency</xr>
         (IAEA), of world uranium resources, production and demand, and of economic and technical aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle.
      </p>
               <p>The NEA’s 2023-28 Strategic Plan focused on the following programme areas: nuclear safety technology and regulation; human aspects of nuclear safety; nuclear science; development and innovation in the civil use of nuclear energy; radiological protection of people and the environment; radioactive waste and spent fuel management; and nuclear decommissioning and legacy management.</p>
               <p>The NEA provides technical secretariat services to the International Framework for Nuclear Energy Cooperation, the Generation IV International Forum (focused on developing the next generation of nuclear energy systems), and the Multinational Design Evaluation Programme (which shares the resources and knowledge accumulated by national nuclear regulatory authorities during their assessment of new reactor designs, with the aim of improving both the efficiency and the effectiveness of the process).</p>
               <p>In February 2019 the NEA initiated a Nuclear Education, Skills and Technology (NEST) Framework. The agency periodically conducts an International Nuclear Emergency Exercise (INEX). The sixth edition (INEX-6) was being undertaken in early 2024. An NEA Small Modular Reactor (SMR) Dashboard, launched in March 2023, comprised (as updated in March 2024) analysis of progress made by 56 SMR designers.</p>
               <p usage="edio">From early 2022 the NEA undertook to assess the state of nuclear safety and radiological protection in Ukraine, following the Russian invasion in February.</p>
