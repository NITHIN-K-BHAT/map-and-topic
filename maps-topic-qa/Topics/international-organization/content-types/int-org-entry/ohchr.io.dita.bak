          <p>OHCHR’s mandate incorporates the promotion and protection of human rights throughout the world; the reinforcement of international co-operation in the field of human rights; the promotion of universal ratification and implementation of international standards; the establishment of a dialogue with governments to ensure respect for human rights; and co-ordination of efforts by other UN programmes and organs to promote respect for human rights. Under the UN Technical Co-operation Programme in the Field of Human Rights, established in 1955, OHCHR assists states, at their request, to strengthen their capacities in the observance of democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. It supports the establishment of independent national human rights institutions; deploys monitoring missions; facilitates the rehabilitation of victims of torture and of slavery; and visits places of detention. The Office studies and responds to cases of serious violations of human rights, and may undertake diplomatic efforts to prevent violations.</p>
          <p>OHCHR’s management programme for 2024-27 had the following six pillars: (i) enhance accountability; (ii) foster participation; (iii) address discrimination; (iv) seek to embed human rights in peace and security; (v) seek to embed human rights in development efforts; and (vi) strengthen support for the core human rights ecosystem. Reinvigorating an effective global human rights movement; enhancing early warning and the global protection agenda in the context of emerging risks; promoting a human rights economy; promoting diversity; promoting rights-based environmental actions; and ensuring that digital technologies and data advance human rights were to be prioritized.</p>
          <p>A Human Rights 75 initiative that was conducted by OHCHR during 2023, to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, culminated in December in a high-level event, held in Geneva, that comprised thematic consultations, dialogues, and a `pledging tree’ session focused on commitments aimed at advancing human rights.</p>

In March 2022 the Office reported that a consistent pattern of arrests, detention, ill treatment, torture, rape and other sexual and gender-based violence, and systematic denial of fair trail rights had been used by the Belarusian authorities to suppress opposition supporters. OHCHR reported that at 31 March 2023 1,462 people remained imprisoned in politically motivated contexts; and that by February of that year the Belarusian authorities had closed 797 non-governmental organizations (NGOs), while 432 other Belarus-based NGOs had dissolved themselves to avoid the risk of prosecution (accounting for most human rights bodies that had been present in the country). The Office reported that new legislation had been introduced by the Belarusian Government aimed at curtailing fundamental freedoms.</p>

                    <p>The ITE on the situation in Kasaï (DRC) was tasked by the HRC in June 2017 with collecting and preserving relevant information and determining the facts regarding alleged violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law in that area since 2016. In June 2018 it released a report that found that certain violations perpetrated since 2016 by the DRC military and by the rebel Kamuina Nsapu Bana Mura militias amounted to crimes against humanity and war crimes. In September 2021 the ITE on Kasaï issued a report that noted ongoing intercommunal clashes, food insecurity, soaring urban crime, and a humanitarian crisis that was attributed in part to forced returns to the region of Congolese from Angola. A decision by the DRC Government to decentralize the transitional justice process was welcomed by the ITE. Little progress, however, was reported in combating impunity. In the following month the 48th session of the HRC extended the scope of the ITE’s mandate to cover the whole of the DRC. In August 2022 the ITE recommended that the DRC authorities prioritize the development of a communication strategy to support national efforts to promote transitional justice and combat impunity; establish a centralized biometric identification system to enable systematic background checks in support of the disarmament and demobilization of former combatants; and promptly adopt legislation on the nationwide prevention and punishment of hate speech and incitement to violence or discrimination. In October 2023 the UN General Assembly requested OHCHR to deploy additional transitional justice experts to Ituri, North Kivu, South Kivu and Tanganyika, and to strengthen support for the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission of Kasaï-Central Province. The ITE was requested to submit its final report to the 57th session of the HRC (scheduled to be held in September-October 2024).</p>

                    <p usage="ewyb edio">During March 2017-September 2019 OHCHR supported a formal FFM, authorized by the HRC, that investigated allegations of state-sponsored mass systematic brutal attacks in Myanmar, in particular against Myanma Rohingya from Rakhine State. The CoI’s final report, released in September, emphasized that the 600,000 Rohingya who were still residing within Myanmar were subject to systematic persecution and were living under the threat of genocide, and that the Myanma Government was failing to prevent, to investigate, to criminalize effectively and to punish genocide. At that time the High Commissioner for Human Rights described Myanmar security operations against the Rohingya as `a textbook example of ethnic cleansing’. The FFM report noted that in attempting to quell civilian support for the Arakan Army—which since 2009 had been mounting an insurgency against the Myanma Tatmadaw (military)—the Tatmadaw had restricted humanitarian access to ethnic Rakhine communities and had confined their freedom of movement, thereby harming their livelihoods and capacity to acquire food. The Myanma military was also accused of the torture and ill-treatment of suspected insurgents, and of perpetrating sexual and gender-based violence. The FFM found that Myanmar should be brought before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on the grounds of failure to honour its obligations as a signatory of the 1948 Genocide Convention. During September the CoI transferred its collected evidence on alleged atrocities perpetrated within Myanmar to the IIMM, which had been authorized by the HRC in September 2018, and was tasked with preparing files to be the basis of future criminal prosecutions under international law. In March 2021, following the Tatmadaw’s seizure of power in Myanmar in February, the IIMM stated that it was collecting evidence relating to arbitrary arrests, enforced disappearances, torture, and the use of force being perpetrated against civilians peacefully protesting the military coup. The Mechanism urged recipients of illegal orders to make direct contact with it, by secure means, to ensure eventual accountability for senior military personnel orchestrating human rights abuses. In that month the HRC adopted a resolution that requested the High Commissioner for Human Rights to monitor the ongoing situation in Myanmar, with a focus on accountability. In its fifth report, issued in June 2023, the IIMM emphasized its ongoing commitment to investigating sexual and gender-based crimes and crimes against children perpetrated against the Rohingya during 2016-17, and observed a dramatic increase since February 2021 in apparent serious international crimes committed in Myanmar, including systematic attacks against civilians. It noted that `millions’ of items of evidence had thus far been accumulated (such as documentation, forensic material, photographs, audio recordings, videos, geospatial imagery, and social media posts).</p>

The GHREN called on the international community to impose sanctions on the entities involved. In September the Group issued an update that emphasized that political opponents and human rights defenders were being pressurized to leave Nicaragua.

                    <heading>Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territories and Israel</heading>
                    <p>
          In May 2021 the HRC established an Independent International CoI to investigate humanitarian and human rights violations that were perpetrated leading up to and since 13 April 2021 in the Palestinian Territories, including East Jerusalem, and in Israel. The first report of the CoI, issued in June 2022, deemed the forced displacement of Palestinians, demolitions of Palestinian homes, expansion of Israeli settlements, settler violence, discrimination against Palestinians, and blockade of Gaza to be factors that were contributing to recurring cycles of violence. The report also noted that the Israeli occupation was used by the Palestinian (National) Authority as a justification for human rights violations and for failing to organize legislative and presidential elections, and that the Palestinian Islamist Hamas leadership in Gaza had shown no commitment to international humanitarian law. In October the CoI notably reported to the UN General Assembly that there were reasonable grounds to conclude that the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory was unlawful under international law, owing to its permanence and to the Israeli Government’s de facto annexation policies. Consequently, in December the UN General Assembly requested the ICJ to issue an Advisory Opinion on the legal status and the consequences of Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory. In May 2023 the CoI on Palestine issued its 
          <publ-name>Detailed findings on attacks and restrictions on and harassment of civil society actors, by all duty bearers</publ-name>
          . In September the CoI deemed that increasingly militarized law enforcement operations conducted by Israel in the West Bank and regular Israeli aerial attacks against targets in Gaza had been aimed at fragmenting Palestinian economic, political and social cohesion and maintaining the Israeli occupation. Hamas militants and other armed groups were urged to end all indiscriminate firing of munitions, including rockets and mortars, towards civilian communities in Israel, and to comply fully with international humanitarian and human rights law. The Israeli authorities were asked to respect Palestinians’ right to self-determination, to end the occupation of the Palestinian territory and Syrian Golan, to end all settlement construction and expansion in the West Bank, to act effectively to prevent violence by West Bank settlers against Palestinians, and to publish in full the Israeli security forces’ rules of engagement. Both sides were urged to end the practice of withholding bodies of captives (at that time Israel was reported to be withholding the bodies of 142 deceased Palestinian combatants and other persons suspected of having posed a threat to Israeli security; and the de facto authorities in Gaza were reportedly withholding the bodies of two Israeli soldiers).

                    <p>In October 2023 the Commission reported that it was collecting and preserving evidence of war crimes perpetrated by both sides following the latest devastating Hamas-Israel conflict. It emphasized that all those who had targeted civilians must be held accountable. At the end of that month the Commission reiterated the urgent need for all parties to comply fully with international humanitarian and human rights laws.</p>

In March 2023 the CoI reported that the parties to the conflict in Syria had continued to commit widespread human rights violations and abuses prior to the earthquakes that had devastated northern areas of the country in February, and that the emergency response initiative had been hindered by failure (of the parties to the conflict and also of the UN) to secure an immediate pause in hostilities, or to facilitate the delivery of life-saving aid. The adoption by the UN General Assembly in June of a resolution that authorized the establishment of an independent institution to clarify the fate and whereabouts of all missing persons in Syria was welcomed by the CoI. In September the CoI issued a report that addressed ongoing systematic patterns of ill treatment and torture in Syrian detention facilities. The CoI welcomed in November a landmark order by the ICJ that Syria take all measures within its power to prevent acts of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and to take effective measures to ensure the preservation of related evidence.</p>

                    <p>
          In late February 2022 the High Commissioner confirmed that the Office’s Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU, first deployed in Ukraine, at the invitation of its Government, in 2014) would remain in that country following the military invasion by the Russian Federation, and would monitor and report on the evolving conflict situation. In early March the 49th session of the HRC adopted a resolution that condemned alleged violations of human rights arising from Russia’s aggression in Ukraine and established a CoI to investigate the situation. The CoI conducted its first mission to Ukraine in June. In September the CoI concluded that war crimes, and violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law had been committed there, mainly by the Russian military. The Commission detailed, 
          <i>inter alia,</i>
           the indiscriminate use of explosive weapons in populated areas and attacks on fleeing civilians; failure to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure through the placement of military forces and objects in or in close proximity to densely populated areas; illegal deportations of Ukrainians to Russia; and unlawful confinement, torture, summary executions, and sexual violence perpetrated in Russian-occupied areas. On 22 August the UN Secretary-General announced the composition of a new FFM 
          
          that had been established, at the request of the Russian and Ukrainian authorities, to investigate an attack on 29 July against a prison at Olenivka, Ukraine, which had caused at least 50 fatalities (culpability for which was attributed by each party to the conflict to the other). In March 2023 OHCHR stated deep concern over the recruitment to the Wagner Group, a Russian private paramilitary and security contractor, of detainees in Russian correctional facilities, who were reportedly being offered pardons and the transfer of remittances to relatives, in return for joining the organization to participate in the invasion of Ukraine. A report issued in October by the CoI detailed further evidence of indiscriminate attacks and war crimes perpetrated by the Russian authorities.

                    <p>During 24 February 2022-31 December 2023 10,191 war-related civilian fatalities were recorded by the HRMMU in Ukraine. A further 19,139 civilians were reported to have suffered conflict-related injuries over that period.</p>

                    <p usage="ewyb edio">The HRC established the FFMV in September 2019 to assess alleged violations of human rights committed since 2014. In September 2020 the FFMV’s first report stated that the Venezuelan state must bring to account members of the security forces and intelligence agencies that were accused of perpetrating arbitrary detentions and systematic torture, enforced disappearances, and extrajudicial executions. The FFMV’s second report, issued in September 2021, found that Venezuela’s judiciary lacked independence and that irregularities were occurring at all stages of the criminal process. Torture (including sexual violence), temporary enforced disappearances and arbitrary deprivation of life were reported, alongside widespread impunity. In October the FFMV stated deep concern over the recent death while in state custody of General Raúl Isaías Baduel (who had been detained since March 2017 and charged with treason and incitement to rebellion). The FFMV urged the Venezuelan authorities to undertake a thorough, transparent investigation into the cause of Baduel’s death, and to remedy judicial irregularities regarding his case that had been highlighted in the September report. In September 2022 the FFMV issued a report that provided an analysis of the chains of command in Venezuela’s military and civilian intelligence agencies, and the role of those agencies in suppressing dissent. In September 2023 the FFMV observed an intensification of state-imposed restrictions—including surveillance, harassment, threats, censorship and defamation—on the civic and democratic space of Venezuela’s individual human rights defenders, civil society organizations, labour unions, political parties and media. The FFMV noted that there appeared to be a continuity of personnel and modus operandi between the Bolivarian National Police’s recently established Directorate of Strategic and Tactical Actions (DAET) and its former Special Action Forces—which, prior to their dissolution in 2022, had been accused by the FFMV of involvement in gross violations of human rights.</p>
