          <p id="OIC.IO.84" usage="mena">The first summit conference of Islamic leaders (representing 24 states) took place in 1969 following the burning of the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. At this conference it was decided that Islamic governments should `consult together with a view to promoting close co-operation and mutual assistance in the economic, scientific, cultural and spiritual fields, inspired by the im­mortal teachings of Islam'. Thereafter the ministers responsible for foreign affairs of the countries concerned met annually, and adopted the Charter of the Organization of the Islamic Conference in 1972.</p>
          <p id="OIC.IO.85" usage="mena sasia fea ass">At the second Islamic summit conference (Lahore, Pakistan, 1974), the Islamic Solidarity Fund was established, together with a committee of representatives that later evolved into the Islamic Com­mission for Economic, Cultural and Social Affairs. Subse­quently, numerous other subsidiary bodies were set up.</p>
          <p>In April 2016 the 13th OIC summit adopted OIC-2025, a 10-year plan of joint Islamic action, which included goals for collaboration in the following areas: the environment, climate change and sustainability; combating extremism, sectarianism and Islamophobia; peace and security; poverty alleviation; trade, investment and finance; agriculture and food; employment infrastructure and industrialization; science, technology and innovation; education; health; the advancement and empowerment of women; family welfare and social security; joint Islamic humanitarian action; human rights, good governance and accountability; and developing communications and digital information structures. A successor 2026-35 OIC plan of action was under development in 2024.</p>

               <p>In 1991 22 OIC member states signed a Framework Agreement on a Trade Preferential System among the OIC Member States (TPS-OIC); this entered into force in 2003, and was envisaged as representing the first step towards the eventual establishment of an Islamic common market. Rules of origin for the TPS-OIC were adopted in September 2007, and a Protocol on the Preferential Tariff Scheme for TPS-OIC (PRETAS) entered into force in February 2010. In April 2016 the 10th OIC summit endorsed the goal that by 2025 some 25% of member states’ trade should be intra-Islamic. The OIC has pursued efforts to enhance the role of the private sector through the promotion of intra-OIC small and medium-sized enterprise clusters, in sectors including agrofood processing, and transportation and logistics.</p>
               <p usage="ass">In July 2020 the OIC Secretariat and Islamic Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture met (virtually) to consider the promotion of Islamic microfinance and proposed establishment of family banks (aimed at strengthening women’s access to finance) in Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger.</p>

               <p>
        The OIC’s Directorate of Culture, Social and Family Affairs comprises two separate departments, the Cultural Affairs Department, which focuses on Islamic cultural issues, the protection of Islamic sites and interfaith dialogue, and the Social and Family Affairs Department. There is also a Youth Unit. In December 2007 the OIC organized the first International Conference on Islamophobia, aimed at addressing concerns that alleged instances of defamation of Islam appeared to be increasing worldwide (particularly in Europe). OIC leaders denounced stereotyping and discrimination, and urged the promotion of Islam by Islamic states as a `moderate, peaceful and tolerant religion'. An Islamic Observatory on Islamophobia, established in 2007, has issued regular reports on intolerance against Muslims; the 14th covered the period December 2020-January 2022. In June 2019 the OIC published an 
        <publ-name>International Islamic Encyclopedia of Tolerance</publ-name>
        .
      </p>
               <p usage="ewyb edio">An open ministerial-level meeting of the OIC Contact Group on Muslims in Europe, convened in September 2022 on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, urged Muslim community leaders in Europe to intensify efforts to promote peaceful co-existence, tolerance and inclusiveness. In early July 2023 an extraordinary meeting of the OIC Executive Committee was held to address a recent incident in Stockholm, Sweden involving the destruction of an Islamic holy book. In late July the OIC Secretary-General suspended the status of Sweden’s special envoy to the organization, asserting that legislative measures should be taken by that country to criminalize attacks on the Qur’an. </p>
               <p>In July 2023 the OIC welcomed the adoption by the UN Human Rights Council of a resolution (that had been proposed by OIC member states) titled `Countering religious hatred constituting incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence’; the resolution condemned religious intolerance and the desecration of holy books. Legislation that was adopted by Denmark’s legislature in early December criminalizing `inappropriate treatment of writings with significant religious importance for a recognized religious community’ was also welcomed by the OIC.</p>
               <p>A 1st OIC Ministerial Conference on Social Development was convened in December 2019, in İstanbul (Türkiye), on the theme `Ensuring Social Equality and Welfare for All in the Member States: Opportunities and Challenges’.</p>
               <p>
        An OIC Plan of Action for the Advancement of Women in Member States was adopted in November 2016 by the sixth session of the Ministerial Conference on Women. 
        <!--~ also called Conference of Ministers in Charge of Women-->
        The eighth Ministerial Conference, convened in July 2021, in Cairo, Egypt, urged member states to ensure that national social protection programmes were supporting people affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including those working in the informal sector, and especially women and girls. The inaugural meeting of an OIC Women’s Advisory Council was convened in May 2017, in İstanbul. In September the OIC Secretary-General and the Executive Director of UN Women signed a Memorandum of Understanding on Inter-Institutional Co-operation, to cover co-ordination on the advancement of women; the eradication of poverty; sustainable development; and the promotion of good governance and the rule of law. The 10th Conference of Muslim Women Parliamentarians was organized in January 2023, in Algiers, Algeria. An International Conference on Women in Islam that was held in November, in Jeddah, issued the Jeddah Document on Women’s Rights in Islam, designed to be a comprehensive formal point of reference for decision makers, researchers, jurists and other experts.
      </p>
               <p>An Islamic Conference of Health Ministers convenes every two years. In February 2014 the OIC inaugurated an Islamic International Advisory Group on Polio Eradication (its eighth session was held in December 2021). The First Meeting of OIC National Medication Regulatory Authorities was held in September 2018, in Indonesia. An OIC internet health portal was developed in that year.</p>
               <p usage="edio sasia mena">
        The inaugural Ministerial Conference on Strengthening Marriage and the Family Institution and Preserving its Values in OIC Member States was convened in Jeddah, in February 2017. This issued the Jeddah Declaration, which emphasized the role of the family—defined as a bond between a man and a woman united through marriage within a 
        <i>Shari`a</i>
         framework—as the grounding of the moral and religious character of individuals.
      </p>
               <p>An OIC Strategy for the Empowerment of the Institution of Marriage and Family was being implemented during 2020-25.</p>
               <p>The fifth session of the Islamic Conference of Ministers of Youth and Sports was convened in September 2022, in Jeddah, on the theme `Development of Youth and Sports for a Solidarity-Based Ummah’. The establishment of an OIC Fund for Youth Training, Employment and Support in the Sahel and the Lake Chad Basin was under consideration in 2024.</p>
               <p>In October 2022 the 12th Islamic Conference of Information Ministers was convened, in İstanbul, on the theme `Combating Disinformation and Islamophobia in the Post-Truth Era’. An extraordinary Conference of Information Ministers was called in February 2024 to address the theme `the Israeli Occupying Authority’s Disinformation and Hostilities against Journalists’.</p>

                    <p usage="sasia">During the 1990s and early 2000s the OIC pursued efforts to secure peace and to promote national reconciliation in Afghanistan. In 2010 the OIC determined to appoint a permanent representative for Afghanistan, and in January 2011 an OIC office was opened in Kabul, the Afghan capital. In March the OIC Secretary-General, addressing the International Contact Group on Afghanistan, stressed OIC support for the High Peace Council, established in Afghanistan in 2010 as a platform for dialogue between the Afghan administration and the Taliban, and stated the willingness of the organization to contribute to peace in that country. In December 2011, attending the International Conference on Afghanistan, convened in Bonn, Germany, the OIC Secretary-General emphasized that the organization would continue to support Afghanistan beyond the departure of NATO forces from the country, which was effected at the end of 2014. In June 2013 Afghanistan ratified the OIC Charter. The OIC participates in meetings of the International Contact Group on Afghanistan. In July 2018 the OIC organized an International Ulema Conference for Peace and Security in Afghanistan, in Makkah, Saudi Arabia. In March 2020 he welcomed an agreement concluded between the USA and Afghanistan, focused on achieving peace through negotiations. He then welcomed the eventual initiation of the intra-Afghan negotiations, in September. In November the Secretary-General participated in a virtual ministerial pledging conference for Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p usage="ewyb edio sasia">From mid-2021 the full withdrawal of US and other NATO military forces from Afghanistan transformed the situation on the ground there dramatically, as the Afghan National Army proved unable to prevent a very rapid expansion of Taliban militant control over provincial centres and key strategic corridors. On 13 August the OIC General Secretariat stated great concern at developments in Afghanistan, and pledged support for an urgent negotiation of a political settlement. Two days later the Taliban, having swiftly captured other cities, took control of Kabul, and stated intent to declare an Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. An extraordinary open-ended meeting of OIC Permanent Representatives, held in the following week, stated solidarity with the people of Afghanistan, and noted with serious concern the ongoing deterioration of the humanitarian situation there. The meeting reiterated the need for inclusive dialogue among all Afghan stakeholders, and for international support to assist Afghanistan’s socioeconomic development.

The impacts on neighbouring countries of Afghanistan’s dire humanitarian and economic situation were stressed, and it was noted that a full economic meltdown would prompt further outflows of migrants and refugees. At that time the Council appointed a new Special Envoy tasked with co-ordinating humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people and with pursuing political and economic engagement there. An Afghanistan Humanitarian Trust Fund (AHTF), endorsed by OIC ministers responsible for foreign affairs, was established in 2022 and is implemented by the

          In September 2019 the OIC Secretary-General stated deep concern over a recent announcement by the Prime Minister of Armenia in which he had declared the disputed Nagornyi Karabakh region (which has a majority ethnic Armenian population) to be a territory of Armenia. The OIC General Secretariat rejected presidential and parliamentary elections held on 31 March 2020 in what it termed `Occupied Nagornyi Karabakh’ as contravening all relevant resolutions of the UN. In response to an outbreak of renewed conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan in September-November in the Nagornyi Karabakh region—during which Azerbaijan made significant territorial gains—the OIC General Secretariat stated solidarity with Azerbaijan, and called for dialogue and for the full and unconditional withdrawal of Armenian forces from the disputed area. A Trilateral Statement was concluded by Azerbaijan, Armenia and Russia in November providing for a ceasefire and the restoration of local transport links and economic activity. In March 2022 OIC ministers responsible for foreign affairs urged the normalization of Azerbaijan-Armenia relations, and adopted resolutions that addressed, 
          <i>inter alia,</i>
           economic assistance to Azerbaijan and the destruction as a consequence of Armenian actions of Islamic historical and cultural shrines on Azerbaijan’s territory. In August the OIC General Secretariat condemned an Armenian attack against Azerbaijani military positions; Armenia was urged to withdraw all military detachments from Azerbaijani territory. In January 2023 the OIC General Secretariat condemned the ongoing illegal exploitation by Armenia of natural resources in Nagornyi Karabakh. A resolution adopted by the OIC Council in March called on Armenia and Azerbaijan to respect each other’s sovereignty and internationally recognized borders. In May the General Secretariat recognized as legitimate a move by Azerbaijan to establish a military border checkpoint on the Lachin corridor that links Nagornyi Karabakh to Armenia. (Armenian forces had been accused by Azerbaijan of using the road for military purposes, in contravention of the provisions of the 2020 Trilateral Statement; from December 2022 Azerbaijanis had blockaded the route, prompting a deterioration of humanitarian conditions in Nagornyi Karabakh.) The OIC condemned as illegitimate and as a violation of Azerbaijani sovereignty presidential elections that were organized in the territory in early September 2023. On 19 September Azerbaijan launched a major military offensive (framed as an anti-terrorist operation) aimed at disarming and forcing the removal of Armenian troops positioned in Nagornyi Karabakh (the Armenian authorities denied deploying its military there). The next day, at which time Azerbaijan claimed a `complete surrender’ by Armenian combatants, a ceasefire was declared; more than 200 Karabakh Armenians were reported to have been killed during the operation. At that time the OIC General Secretariat condemned armed Armenian provocations and reiterated calls for Armenia to withdraw its armed forces from Nagornyi Karabakh. By 2 October 100,514 (of a total population of around 120,000) ethnic Armenians had fled from the enclave to Armenia. The then Nagorno-Karabakh leadership signed a decree in September stipulating that the entity would be dissolved on 1 January 2024.

In retaliation for a suicide bombing that had killed at least 40 Indian troops in Kashmir, India had fired on an alleged militant camp in Pakistan, and, subsequently, the Pakistan military had shot down two Indian military planes and captured an Indian pilot. The Contact Group urged an immediate de-escalation of the situation (the first aerial attacks across the local Line of Control since 1971). It called on India to end repressive security operations against civilians in Jammu and Kashmir, and to address the dispute within the context of relevant OIC and UN Security Council resolutions. The situation was discussed in early March 2019 by OIC ministers responsible for foreign affairs. In May the OIC summit meeting approved the appointment of a new Special Envoy to Jammu and Kashmir. An urgent meeting of the Contact Group was convened in early August, at the request of Pakistan, to review the situation following the Indian Government’s decision to revoke the special status and autonomy previously granted to its administered part of Kashmir. The OIC Secretary-General expressed deep concern at the situation, condemned reported human rights violations and urged the international community to support a negotiated settlement; the recent enactment by India of legislation perceived as discriminatory to Muslims would be given particular consideration by the organization. An IPHRC delegation visited the Pakistani side of the Line of Control during August 2021. In May 2022 the OIC General Secretariat stated concern over plans by India to redraft electoral boundaries within Kashmir, and stated that this would contravene relevant UN Security Council resolutions. In October the OIC General Secretariat marked the 75th anniversary of the commencement of India’s administration of Jammu and Kashmir by reiterating solidarity with the local people in their quest for the right to self-determination. The OIC Council of Foreign Ministers called on India in March 2023 to reverse all unilateral and illegal measures taken since August 2019, and to cease systemic human rights abuses in Jammu and Kashmir.

The new military leadership determined in mid-September that an 18-month transitional administration would be established pending new national elections.

In March 2013 the OIC Secretary-General launched a Global Rohingya Centre, based at OIC headquarters. In September the Contact Group requested the Myanmar authorities to find a satisfactory solution to the situation of the Rohingya, including relating to their birthrights and legal status (they were at that time regarded by the Myanmar authorities as stateless residents). A Special Envoy to Myanmar, tasked with strengthening diplomatic engagement between the OIC and the Myanmar authorities, was appointed in May 2014. In the following month the Jeddah Declaration, adopted by OIC ministers responsible for foreign affairs, demanded the cessation of violence and discrimination against the Rohingya. In September 2015 the Contact Group adopted an action plan recommended by the OIC’s Special Envoy to Myanmar, and, 
          <i>inter alia,</i>
           urged the Myanmar authorities to implement a comprehensive reconciliation process encompassing all Myanmar social groups.

The OIC Contact Group on the Rohingya urged the UN Security Council in September to take prompt action to halt the Rohingya crisis. The violent insecurity in Rakhine prompted the rapid mass flight of Rohingya Muslims into the Cox’s Bazar area of Bangladesh. The OIC welcomed the approval by the UN General Assembly in December of a resolution (that it had sponsored) to call upon the UN Secretary-General to appoint a Special Envoy to Myanmar. Meeting in May 2018 OIC ministers responsible for foreign affairs determined to establish an ad hoc ministerial committee, under the chairmanship of The Gambia, to address means of holding the perpetrators of human rights violations against the Rohingya to account.</p>

In January 2020 the OIC welcomed a unanimous decision by the ICJ ordering the Myanmar authorities to implement provisional measures to prevent the occurrence of further acts of genocide against Rohingya. In June the OIC General Secretariat welcomed a resolution of the UN Human Rights Council which called on all parties, in particular the Myanmar security forces and military, to halt forthwith all violent acts and violations of international law, while expressing grave concern over the culture of impunity among the Myanmar security forces and over continuing conflict and forced displacement in Rakhine, Chin and Kachin States.</p>

In March 2022 the OIC Secretary-General emphasized that the Myanma regime had not yet created an environment suitable for the Rohingyas’ dignified repatriation. In September the OIC Contact Group on the Rohingya urged the Myanmar Government to respond to an ongoing offer by the OIC to establish a health facility in Rakhine, as well as a technical school and an interreligious dialogue symposium. In early 2023 plans to provide pathways into quality education for Rohingya refugees were discussed by the OIC and UN. In March the OIC Secretary-General stated compassion and solidarity for Rohingya refugees that had been affected by a recent devastating fire in one of the Cox’s Bazar encampments. Member states and relevant agencies were urged to extend humanitarian support to the survivors. During a visit undertaken in May to Bangladesh, the OIC Secretary-General commended that country’s assistance to the refugees. A delegation comprising representatives of the OIC, Islamic Solidarity Fund, UN High Commissioner for Refugees and other partners visited two Cox’s Bazar sites in August to assess the ongoing situation.

The meeting strongly condemned the Israeli attacks and ensuing destruction and loss of civilian life, and requested the OIC General Secretariat to co-ordinate with member states' civil society organizations to provide urgent humanitarian relief to the Palestinian people. In March, while visiting the affected area, the OIC Secretary-General urged the reconciliation of the different Palestinian political factions. In June 2010 an expanded extraordinary ministerial meeting of the Executive Committee condemned the attack by Israeli security forces, at the end of May, against a flotilla of vessels carrying humanitarian aid to Gaza, which had resulted in nine civilian deaths and caused injuries to at least 40 people. The OIC rejected a UN-commissioned report on the flotilla incident, released in September 2011, which—while concluding that the Israeli army had used `excessive and unreasonable’ force—also found the Israeli naval blockade of Gaza to have been imposed as a `legitimate security measure’ to prevent weapons from reaching Gaza by sea, and found that the flotilla had acted recklessly in attempting to breach the naval blockade.

Furthermore, the meeting demanded that the international community designate the leaderships of `extreme’ nationalistic Israeli settler communities as terrorists and criminals wanted for international prosecution. An international legal team was to be constituted within the OIC to pursue the issue of conducting criminal cases against Israeli leaders at the International Criminal Court (ICC). In early August the OIC Secretary-General condemned attacks by the Israeli military against mosques in Gaza. In mid-August a second expanded OIC extraordinary ministerial meeting on the Gaza situation was convened, in Jeddah. The meeting welcomed a recent decision of the UN Human Rights Council to appoint an independent international commission to investigate violations of international humanitarian law in the occupied Palestinian territories, while expressing deep regret at the USA’s rejection of this resolution, and the abstention of some European countries. On 26 August, as a result of indirect negotiations between Hamas and Israel, mediated by Egypt, the two sides concluded an agreement on a long-term truce in Gaza. In early September an OIC multi-party delegation undertook a fact-finding field tour of Gaza to assess the extent of the damage sustained under the Israeli bombardment against targets that included residential homes, civilian facilities, farming areas, and local infrastructure. During that month the OIC Secretary-General condemned Israel’s confiscation of 400 ha of Palestinian land in the West Bank, near Bethlehem, and emphasized that the Israeli policy of expanding settlements on confiscated land was in violation of relevant international law and resolutions.</p>

          The fifth Extraordinary Islamic Summit on Palestine and Al-Quds Al-Sharif, convened under OIC auspices in March 2016, in Jakarta, Indonesia, discussed actions by Israel to alter the demographic profile and eliminate the Islamic identity of areas under its control. An OIC Representative Office in Palestine (Ramallah) was inaugurated in June. In August 2017 an extraordinary meeting of OIC foreign ministers—held in response to violent unrest that had followed the murder, by armed Palestinians, of two Israeli police officers in mid-July, close to the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem—strongly condemned recent actions by Israel, citing, 
          <i>inter alia,</i>
           an attempt to install metal detectors at the al-Aqsa Mosque compound, its temporary closure, and the development of legislation aimed at effectively altering the demographic composition of Jerusalem. In December the OIC denounced as contrary to international law and as a provocation to Muslim sentiments a recent decision by US President Trump to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. An extraordinary summit meeting (the OIC’s sixth such gathering), convened in İstanbul, declared that the decision lacked any legitimacy and urged the international community to recognize East Jerusalem as the Palestinian capital.

                    <p usage="edio ewyb mena">The OIC Secretary-General strongly condemned the Israeli military’s suppression at the end of March 2018 of a `Great March of Return’ demonstration by Palestinians, which had resulted in the deaths of at least 16 Palestinian protesters. In mid-May, at the request of Turkey (known as Türkiye from June 2022), the Seventh Extraordinary Islamic Summit Conference in Response to the Grave Developments in the State of Palestine was convened, in İstanbul. The summit meeting condemned in the strongest terms the actions of Israeli troops in Palestine, and held Israel fully accountable for the killing of at least 60 Palestinian civilians attending a protest in Gaza against the relocation in that month of the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem (a move it described as an act of provocation and hostility against the Ummah, Palestinian national rights and international law). The meeting called on the UN to investigate recent events in Gaza, and on the OIC General Secretariat promptly to establish an international independent committee of experts to consider the situation, to determine the culpability of Israeli officials, and to report its findings to relevant international bodies.</p>
                    <p usage="ewyb edio mena">In July 2018 the OIC Secretary-General condemned legislation recently adopted by the Israeli Knesset that defined Israel as `the Nation-State of the Jewish People’. He urged the international community to reject the law as discriminatory, noting that it represented disregard for the established historical rights of local Palestinians, Muslims and Christians.</p>
                    <p usage="ewyb edio mena">In March 2019 the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers determined to establish a new Waqf (endowment) Fund to Support Palestine Refugees. Later in that month the OIC General Secretariat condemned the recognition by the US Administration of Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Syrian Golan territory, emphasizing that this constituted an explicit violation of relevant international law and UN resolutions. In May the OIC summit meeting urged member states to impose sanctions against countries that join the USA in recognizing Jerusalem as the Israeli capital. In July an extraordinary OIC open-ended ministerial meeting was convened to address an intensification of Israeli actions aimed at the Judaization of Al-Quds—including altering the city’s legal status, isolating it from its Palestinian hinterground, and repeated interferences with the al-Aqsa mosque. An extraordinary meeting of the OIC Council was organized in September, at the request of Saudi Arabia, to address and condemn the recently stated intent of the Israeli Prime Minister to impose Israeli sovereignty on the whole of the Jordan Valley, northern Dead Sea area, and on the West Bank, should he be re-elected at ongoing legislative elections. At that time the OIC Secretary-General called for the international community to put in place political and legal mechanisms to hold Israel accountable for its violations of international law and to protect the Palestinian people and their lands. In February 2020 the Secretary-General welcomed the publication of a UN list of businesses engaged in activities relating to illegal Israeli settlements, and strongly condemned the Israeli authorities for approving a scheme to construct thousands of new housing units in Jerusalem. In May he approved a report by the Prosecutor of the ICC which confirmed her position that the Court did have jurisdiction over the Palestinian Territories. An extraordinary (virtual) meeting of OIC ministers responsible for foreign affairs that was held in June, at the request of Palestine, warned against `dangerous’ intentions by Israel to annex parts of Palestine, and emphasized Palestine’s continuing right to sovereignty over territory occupied by Israel since 1967. The meeting urged the international community to counter Israel’s `colonial practices’ that were contravening the rules-based international order. In late August, reiterating support for the 2002 Arab peace initiative, and affirming the illegality of any unilateral attempt by Israel to annex Palestinian lands, the Secretary-General stated that the situation of Palestine and Al-Quds (Jerusalem) was the OIC’s `pivotal cause’, and was at the core of joint Islamic action. Under an arrangement concluded in mid-August 2020 by Israel and the UAE—which was aimed at normalizing bilateral diplomatic relations, and had been negotiated under US auspices—Israel agreed temporarily, but not definitively, to suspend the annexation of West Bank territory from Palestine. Formal agreements on normalizing relations with Israel were signed by both the UAE and Bahrain on 15 September, in Washington, DC, USA. In early 2021 Sudan signed a similar accord.</p>
                    <p usage="ewyb edio mena">In February 2021 the OIC General Secretariat welcomed a ruling by a Pre-Trial Chamber of the ICC that the Court’s territorial scope extended to Gaza and the West Bank, including East Al-Quds (Jerusalem). In mid-May a virtual open-ended extraordinary meeting of OIC ministers responsible for foreign affairs condemned in the strongest terms ongoing attacks by Israel against the Palestinian people, land and holy sites. The OIC General Secretariat welcomed an Egypt-mediated ceasefire agreement that took effect on 21 May.</p>
                    <p usage="ewyb edio mena">In December 2021 an extraordinary meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers, held in Islamabad, Pakistan, reiterated unequivocal condemnation of all illegal measures taken by Israel to `colonize’ Palestinian territory, including constructing settlement blocks in and around Al-Quds (Jerusalem), and confiscating and demolishing Palestinians’ properties, for example in the neighbourhoods of Silwan and Sheikh Jarrah. The Council restated the need to achieve a just, lasting peace rooted in international law, and called on the UN Security Council to bring Israel to account, including through the imposition of sanctions. In February 2022 the OIC General Secretariat condemned `incessant’ attacks perpetrated against Palestinian citizens, as part of a policy of Judaization, by extremist settler groups and Israeli forces, with the aim of seizing Palestinian homes in Sheikh Jarrah. At an emergency meeting of the Council convened in April the OIC Secretary-General condemned all attempts to impose temporal and spatial division on the al-Aqsa Mosque, and called for an unprecedented mobilization of efforts to protect Al-Quds and its holy sites. In October the OIC General Secretariat welcomed the conclusion by Palestinian factions, following an Algeria-sponsored dialogue, of the Algeria Declaration of National Reconciliation. At the end of 2022 the General Secretariat welcomed resolutions recently adopted by the UN General Assembly relating to Palestine, and in particular one that requested the International Court of Justice to issue an Advisory Opinion on the legal status and the consequences of Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory.</p>
                    <p usage="ewyb edio mena">In early January 2023 an extraordinary open-ended session of the OIC Executive Committee strongly condemned a provocative visit to the al-Aqsa Mosque undertaken by Itamar Ben-Gvir, the hard-line Israeli Minister of National Security (described by the Committee as a `minister in the Israeli colonial occupation cabinet’). The Committee demanded that the UN Security Council act urgently to end the all provocative and illegal Israeli measures and policies imposed on the mosque and more broadly on Al-Quds. Meeting in late February a further extraordinary open-ended session of the Executive Committee addressed an ongoing escalation of aggression by Israel against Palestine, including an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) raid on 22 February that, while targeting three Palestinian militants in Nablus, had killed in total 11 Palestinians, and injured many more. The UN Security Council was urged to take all necessary measures to ensure the protection of the Palestinian people, and the ICC was requested to hold Israel to account. The OIC Secretary-General emphasized that Israel's impunity was prolonging its present policies towards Palestine. In early March the General Secretariat condemned the killing by the IDF of at least six Palestinians in a refugee camp at Jenin (West Bank). Continuing acts of violence perpetrated by extremist settlers in the West Bank town of Hawara were also deplored. A further extraordinary meeting of the OIC Executive Committee that was convened in May emphasized the status of the entire area of the al-Aqsa Mosque and al-Haram Al-Sharif (Temple Mount), as a `pure place of worship for Muslims’. In June the OIC General Secretariat accused Israel of conducting an indiscriminate open war against residential areas of the town of Jenin and its refugee camp, and strongly condemned a recent Israeli decision to shorten settlement construction procedures. In early July the General Secretariat strongly condemned a new major Israeli operation in the West Bank (reportedly the largest there for two decades)—Israeli forces having launched a massive aerial raid against the Jenin camp, that involved at least 10 drone strikes and an estimated 2,000 troops.</p>
                    <p usage="ewyb edio mena">
          The OIC’s General Secretariat stated great concern over the massive escalation of Hamas-Israel conflict from 7 October 2023, describing the root causes of ongoing instability as: the continuing Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory, Israel’s failure to adhere to relevant international resolutions, and the escalation of the pace of Israel’s attacks against `the Palestinian people, their land and sanctities’. The 18th extraordinary session of the OIC Council of ministers responsible for foreign affairs, convened in mid-October, in Jeddah, issued a statement that deplored support by certain countries for Israel’s `brutal aggression against the Palestinian people’, and condemned the UN Security Council for failing to unite to halt the violence. A Joint Arab-Islamic Extraordinary Summit was convened in early November, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, at which the heads of state and government of OIC and 
          <xr pageref="N" ref="LAS.IO">Arab League</xr>
           members reaffirmed their solidarity with the Palestinian people and called for an immediate, durable, and comprehensive cessation of Israeli military action; during the conference the OIC Secretary-General emphasized the OIC’s rejection of any forced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza. In the following month the OIC condemned `the Israeli occupation’ for permitting extremist Israeli settler groups to march through old neighbourhoods of the Al-Quds. In mid-December an Israeli decision to confiscate Palestinian homes and lands in Silwan, Al-Quds (to facilitate an infrastructure project) was condemned by the OIC.

          In January 2024 the OIC stated regret at the decision made by several states to suspend new funding to the 
          <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-UN.1643">UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA)</xr>
           (in response to Israeli accusations that several members of staff had participated in Hamas terrorism). The OIC deemed the suspension to be a collective punishment. In early March the Council of Foreign Ministers rejected any prejudice to UNRWA’s role, including any potential cancellation of its mandate; at that time the OIC Secretary-General urged that funding for the agency should be augmented. In early 2024 an OIC Observatory on Israel’s Crimes against Palestinians was being updated on a weekly basis. On 12 March the Observatory reported that in the past week: 583 Palestinians had been killed (mainly in Gaza), and 182 Palestinians had been arrested in the West Bank, 39 attacks had been perpetrated by Israeli settlers on Palestinian towns and villages (mainly in Hebron, Ramallah, Nablus, Tulkaram, Salfit, Bethlehem, and Jericho), and the Israeli authorities had approved a plan to build 3,500 new settlements. The Observatory also reported at that time that in February 3,274 violations had been perpetrated against the sanctity of the al-Aqsa Mosque.

                    <p usage="edio fea">In July 2018 the OIC welcomed the adoption in the Philippines (which is not an OIC member state) of legislation that enhanced the autonomy of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM, established in 1989), and offered districts adjacent to the country’s Bangsamoro region the opportunity to vote to opt into the ARMM. In January 2019 the OIC Secretary-General welcomed the outcome of a subsequent referendum which extended the scope of autonomy for (Moro) Muslims in the region, resulting in the replacement of the ARMM by a new Bansamoro Autonomous Region in Mindanao. The OIC called on the Moro leadership at that time to unite and commit to a lasting peace in Bangsamoro. On the following day the OIC General Secretariat strongly condemned an attack on a Roman Catholic cathedral in Bansamoro, in which at least 20 civilians were killed. In January 2020 the OIC Secretary-General sent a delegation to the Philippines to meet with representatives of the national Government and of Moro groups, with a view to assessing the progress of the peace process. In November 2022 he received a visit from the Secretary of the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos.</p>

                    <p usage="ewyb edio ass">In May 2023, in view of the outbreak in April of violent conflict in Sudan between the powerful Sudanese paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF, formed in 2013) and the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), the OIC Secretary-General issued a broad appeal to member states, financial and humanitarian institutions and other international donors for urgent humanitarian assistance to Sudan. An emergency session of the OIC Executive Committee convened in early May called for dialogue between the warring parties. Also in early May, the OIC Secretary-General welcomed the initiation of RSF-SAF talks mediated by Saudi Arabia and the USA, in Jeddah. On 31 May, however, the SAF suspended its participation in the talks, having accused the RSF of lack of commitment. Meanwhile, the OIC General Secretariat condemned a series of attacks against foreign diplomatic missions in Khartoum, the Sudanese capital. In June the General Secretariat sent a team to Chad to assess the humanitarian requirements of Sudanese refugees sheltering there. Marking the Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha in that month, the OIC Secretary-General appealed to all warring parties in Sudan to focus on the achievement of a comprehensive ceasefire. In mid-July, during a summit held in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, under the chairmanship of that country’s President, Abd al-Fatah al-Sisi, the SAF and RAF reportedly agreed to the establishment of a mechanism focused on ending the conflict that was to comprise the ministers responsible for foreign affairs of the states neighbouring Sudan. Later in July an SAF negotiating team was dispatched to Jeddah, with a view to resuming the negotiations process. However, it was reported at the beginning of August that the RSF leadership was insisting that the leadership of the SAF (accused by the RSF of having connections to Islamist elements) should be replaced as a condition for the resolution of the conflict. In October the OIC General Secretariat welcomed a resumption of bilateral talks.</p>

                    <p usage="edio mena">In December 2011 the OIC Executive Committee convened a ministerial open-ended meeting to address the violent unrest that had prevailed since March in Syria. The OIC Secretary-General strongly condemned the mass killings of civilians perpetrated by Syrian security forces in May-July 2012. An emergency OIC summit, convened in Makkah, Saudi Arabia, in August, determined to suspend Syria from participation in the activities of the organization and from all its subsidiary organs and specialized and affiliated institutions. The meeting demanded the immediate implementation of a UN-Arab League peace plan that had been agreed in March by the Syrian authorities and opposition, but was not being observed, and urged the UN Security Council to take measures to end the ongoing violence and to pursue a peaceful and lasting solution to the Syrian crisis. Syria's suspension from the OIC was opposed by Iran. In February 2013 the 12th OIC summit urged a Syrian-led negotiated solution to the ongoing conflict, and reaffirmed support to the UN-Arab League Joint Special Representative on Syria. In mid-September the OIC Secretary-General welcomed the release of the report by a UN weapons inspection team into the deployment, on 21 August, of chemical weapons against civilians in Damascus, Syria, that had caused an estimated 1,400 fatalities. Condemning the incident as a war crime and crime against humanity, he emphasized the need to hold to account any party involved in the production, transfer, development and use of chem­ical weapons in Syria. In December an OIC-sponsored Centre for the Treatment of Psychological and Social Shocks was inaugurated in Kayleis, Turkey, to support Syrian refugees in that country. In January 2014 the OIC Secretary-General addressed the Geneva II Syrian peace talks, urging an immediate ceasefire and the creation of a national transitional government. In February 2016 the OIC Secretary-General expressed concern at the stalling of Syrian peace talks in Geneva, Switzerland. In the following month he welcomed a decision by Russia partially to withdraw troops from Syria, and indicated that this would have a positive impact on the negotiations process. In early August the OIC Secretary-General condemned in the strongest terms the high numbers of civilian fatalities and injuries that were occurring as a result of military operations being undertaken in Aleppo by the Syrian Government and allied forces. He stressed that the international community should intervene urgently to halt air raids and the shelling of civilians, and to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance to blockaded areas Syria. He also urged the swift resumption of the UN-guided process to find a political solution in Syria. Shortly afterwards, he issued a message to the Russian minister responsible for foreign affairs, in which he noted that the OIC was following with profound concern the deteriorating situation in Syria, and urged concerted diplomatic efforts towards promptly resolving the crisis. In late September the OIC Secretary-General again strongly condemned the continued bombing of civilians in Aleppo, and denounced the shelling of humanitarian aid convoys by Syrian Government and allied forces. He stated that these were war crimes for which the Syrian regime ought to be held accountable. Following the entry into effect in December of a ceasefire in Syria, facilitated by Russia, Turkey and Iran, the OIC welcomed several rounds of talks addressing the crisis in Syria that were subsequently organized by those three countries. The OIC also supported the continuation of the UN-supported Geneva-based negotiations process. In early April 2017 the OIC Secretary-General strongly condemned a reported chemical attack against the northwestern Syrian settlement of Khan Sheikhoun. In February 2018 he demanded the immediate cessation of raids by the Syrian and allied militaries on civilian residential areas in Idlib and Ghouta. The OIC has participated in meetings of the International Syria Support Group. The OIC Secretary-General repeatedly condemned the destruction by Islamic State of historical monuments in both Syria and Iraq.</p>

          In March 2015 the OIC Secretary-General expressed support for international efforts to promote constitutional legitimacy in Yemen, in view of ongoing activities being perpetrated by the Shi`a secessionist Ansar Allah (`Houthi’) rebel grouping that were aimed at overthrowing government institutions. In May the OIC Secretary-General welcomed the adoption by Yemeni stakeholders of the `Riyadh Declaration’ urging the resumption of the legitimate political process. An OIC Contact Group on Yemen met for the first time in October, in New York. In April 2016 the 13th OIC summit reiterated continued support for a GCC peace initiative for Yemen (that had been launched in 2011) and UN-sponsored peace efforts. An extraordinary session of OIC foreign ministers was convened in November to address the launching by Houthi militia in Yemen of a long-range ballistic missile in the direction of Makkah, Saudi Arabia. In May 2017 the OIC Secretary-General strongly condemned a missile attack against a mosque in Ma`rib, Yemen, which had caused significant fatalities. An emergency meeting of the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers was held in January 2018 to address the Houthi militant campaign against Saudi Arabia. In August the OIC Secretary-General condemned the alleged targeting by Houthi militia of international trade and maritime navigation in the Red Sea’s Bab al-Mandab strait; he also deplored recent alleged Houthi attacks on two Saudi Arabian oil tankers. The OIC welcomed advances made during peace talks between the parties to the conflict that were mediated in Sweden by the UN Special Envoy to Yemen in December, and in which they formally agreed to observe a ceasefire in the port city of Hodeidah (Hudaydah), and for a phased Houthi withdrawal from that area. In early September 2019 the OIC Secretary-General restated the OIC’s support for the efforts of the Saudi-led Arab coalition to defeat the Houthi militias and Yemeni terrorist groupings. He welcomed a recent joint Saudi-UAE statement on the promotion of the `Jeddah Dialogue’ between the legitimate Yemeni authorities and the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC) which had taken control during August of the southern Yemen port city of Aden. On 5 November the Jeddah Dialogue culminated in the signature of the Riyadh Agreement, with provisions covering security, military and political issues. These included the establishment of a national unity government to represent, on an equal basis, southern and northern Yemen and for the national Government to return to Aden without obstructions. In October 2021, when strongly condemning as `despicable’ a terrorist attack in Aden that had targeted a convoy of senior government members, the OIC General Secretariat urged the full implementation of the Riyadh Agreement. The OIC Secretary-General consistently deplored repeated Houthi long-range ballistic missile launches against Saudi Arabia, and all targeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure. In January 2022 the OIC strongly condemned a Houthi terrorist assault against the airport in Abu Dhabi, UAE. In March the OIC Secretary-General welcomed a decision by the UN Security Council to designate Ansar Allah (the Houthis) as a terrorist group. The OIC Secretary-General attended GCC-hosted UN-mediated Yemeni-Yemeni consultations that were convened in Riyadh in late March-early April, and urged all Yemeni stakeholders to pursue a comprehensive political solution to the conflict; the UN Special Envoy announced at the beginning of April that agreement on a truce had been reached. The OIC General Secretariat welcomed successive extensions of the truce, until 2 October. In December 2023 the OIC welcomed an announcement by the UN Special Envoy that Yemeni stakeholders had approved a road map to support a path towards nationwide peace. The General Secretariat stated grave concern in mid-January 2024 over an escalation of insecurity in the Red Sea and Yemen (see
