A revised agreement to establish the Fund as a permanent international agency was signed in May 1980.</p>

               <p>The resources of OFID consist of contributions by OPEC member countries, and income received from operations or otherwise accruing to the Fund. Its unit of account is the US dollar.</p>
               <p>The initial endowment of OFID amounted to US&#8201;$800m. Its resources have been replenished four times—the Fourth Replenishment, covering 2013-24 and totalling $1,000m., was approved by the Ministerial Council in June 2011. OFID’s resources have also been increased by the profits accruing to several OPEC member countries through the sales of gold held by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). At the end of 2022 the total pledged contributions by member countries amounted to $3,461.5m., and paid-in contributions totalled $2,864.1m. In July 2019 the Ministerial Council approved a Strategic Framework 2030, with a focus on diversifying the Fund’s financial resources; enhancing its development impact, including its contribution to delivering the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); fostering partnerships; and improving institutional efficiency.&#160;In 2020, under Strategic Framework 2030, OFID established a Special Capital Resources (SCR) fund, through which it extends long-term and low-cost sovereign (i.e. state-guaranteed) loans to support social and economic development in Least Developed Countries. OFID’s other capital resources were renamed Ordinary Capital Resources (OCR), and have a focus on operations in medium-income countries.</p>

          <p>OFID aims to reinforce financial co-operation between OPEC member countries and other developing countries (`partner countries’, of which there were 125 in 2024) through the provision of financial support to the latter on appropriate terms, to assist them in their economic and social development. Eligible beneficiaries of the Fund's assistance are the governments of developing countries other than OPEC member countries, and international development agencies whose benefi­ciaries are developing countries. OFID gives priority to the countries with the lowest incomes. It is empowered to provide concessional loans for balance of payments support and for the implementation of development projects and programmes; to contribute to the resources of other international development agencies; to finance technical assistance, research, food aid and humanitarian emergency relief through grants; and to participate in the financing of private sector activities in developing countries. Development projects aim to foster self-reliance.</p>
          <p>Since 2006 OFID has presented an Annual Award for Development, to recognize individuals or bodies that had made a significant contribution to enhancing sustainable development.</p>

               <heading>Financial Operations</heading>
               <p>By the end of 2022 OFID commitments since operations began in 1976 totalled US&#8201;$24,679m. During that year OFID's total approvals, for 48 transactions, amounted to $1,670m., of which $1,439m. was allocated through the OCR and $225m. through the SCR. Some $469m. was committed to fund initiatives in the Middle East, North Africa, Eastern Europe and Central Asia; $285m. to West and Central Africa; $266m. to Asia and the Pacific; $143m. to Latin America and the Caribbean; and $99m. to Eastern and Southern Africa.</p>
               <p>OFID’s public sector operations are co-financed, and are aligned with partner countries’ development priorities, emphasizing strengthening institutions and capacity building. In 2022 OFID provided US&#8201;$979m. for 21 public sector projects.</p>
               <p>OFID’s private sector window fosters productive private enterprise and local capital market development. Loans are extended to businesses to finance initiatives with well defined developmental objectives, such as strengthening infrastructure, enhancing utilities and advancing industrial capacity. Direct equity investments and investments in private equity structures are also made, and loans are extended to financial institutions with the aim of improving the capital base of banks, and for onwards lending to medium-sized and small enterprises (MSMEs). In 2022 OFID provided US&#8201;$287m. for nine private sector projects. Through its trade finance window OFID extends loans, lines of credit and guarantees to support international trade operations in developing countries. The Fund has assisted more than 7,000 beneficiaries through risk-sharing initiatives.</p>
               <p usage="mena">Private sector approvals in 2022 included (in February) a US&#8201;$20m. contribution to part-fund an initiative in Egypt that supported import financing for crude oil and other refined products. Public sector approvals included (in August) a $100m. contribution to part-fund an emergency food security project in Jordan.</p>
               <p>OFID extends grants to support technical assistance, capacity building, special development and emergency aid initiatives in partner countries, with a view to building public goods and assisting disadvantaged populations. Under OFID’s Strategic Framework 2030 all grants were to be directed towards activities that had a measurable development impact. During 1976-2022 OFID approved more than US&#8201;$644m. in grant funding.</p>
               <p>In June 2022 OFID launched a Food Security Action Plan fund, through which it was to channel US&#8201;$1,000m. over a three-year period to finance the emergency provision of food supplies and also initiatives aimed at fostering longer term resilience. The Plan was part of a broader Arab Coordination Group (q.v.) commitment to extend $10,000m. to enhance food security. Under OFID’s inaugural Climate Action Plan, initiated in September, some 25% of all new financing was to be committed to projects with a climate action dimension by 2025, rising to 40% by 2030. From 2023 all new projects were assessed for climate action potential and low carbon options.</p>
               <p>In January 2023 OFID launched a 3-year fixed-rate sustainability bond, raising US&#8201;$1,000m., which was to be used to finance and refinance sustainable development projects that contribute to achieving the UN SDGs.</p>

        OFID is a lead partner in the global 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-ENVIRON.12">Sustainable Energy for All</xr>
         (SEforALL) initiative that was launched by the United Nations (UN) Secretary-General in September 2011. In June 2012 the Ministerial Council issued a landmark declaration that reaffirmed member states’ commitment to eradicating global energy poverty. Consequently, initiatives concerning energy, food security and sustainable water access, as well as enabling investment in transport projects, were given heightened priority. The Fund supports public and private sector projects aimed at accelerating the transition to modern, clean and renewable energy sources, in the context of UN SDG 7 concerning universal access to energy, energy efficiency and increased use of renewable resources, and related targets incorporated into the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. In November 2022 OFID, SEforALL and the UN Capital Development Fund jointly launched a Climate Finance and Energy Innovation Hub.
      </p>
               <p>OFID participates—with the Islamic Development Bank, Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa, Arab Monetary Fund and other partners—in the Arab Coordination Group (ACG), a strategic alliance that was established in 1975, and aims collectively to optimize resources to advance sustainable development. The Arab Development Portal, launched in 2016 by the ACG and the UN Development Programme, provides continually updated data and information online relating to development in the Arab region. The 18th annual meeting of ACG heads of institutions, hosted by OFID, in Vienna, in June 2023, determined to scale up support to Africa. OFID was to host its third annual Development Forum—attended by ministers and senior officials of member states, the ACG and other multilateral development institutions—in June 2024, on the theme `Driving Resilience &amp; Equity’.</p>
               <p>
        OFID also works closely with other regional development institutions, including the West African Development Bank (BOAD). A new agreement on co-operation was signed with the 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="EBRD.IO">European Bank for Reconstruction and Development</xr>
         in April 2023. In October 2021 OFID signed a co-operation agreement with the 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="CAN.IO.42">Corporación Andina de Fomento</xr>
         (CAF—Development Bank of Latin America), under which the Fund committed to providing up to US&#8201;$600m. to support public sector projects in Latin America and the Caribbean over the period 2022-24.
