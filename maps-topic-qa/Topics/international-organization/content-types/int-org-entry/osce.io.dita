          <p>The OSCE was established in 1972 as the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), providing a multilateral forum for dialogue and negotiation. The areas of competence of the CSCE were expanded by the Charter of Paris for a New Europe (1990), which transformed the CSCE from an ad hoc forum into an organization with permanent institutions, and the Helsinki Document 1992. In December 1994 the summit conference adopted the new name of OSCE, in order to reflect the organization's changing political role and strengthened secretariat.</p>

          <p>The OSCE has developed commitments in the following three security `dimensions’: politico-military (covering arms control, cybercrime, terrorism, conflict prevention and resolution, and military and police reform); economic and environmental (covering money-laundering, economies, energy, entrepreneurship, environment and good governance); and human (covering elections, freedom of the media and freedom of expression, human rights, minority issues, Roma and Sinti affairs, rule of law and tolerance). Cross-cutting transnational challenges include climate change; radicalization, terrorism and violent extremism; and organized crime, cybercrime and trafficking in arms, illicit drugs, and human beings.</p>
          <p>In December 1994 the summit conference redesignated the CSCE as the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and endorsed the role of the organization as the primary instrument for early warning, conflict prevention and crisis management in the region.</p>
          <p>In December 2010 OSCE heads of state and of government, meeting in Kazakhstan, adopted the Astana Commemorative Declaration: Towards a Security Community, which reaffirmed the core principles and commitments of the OSCE. The Declaration asserted that commitments in the three security dimensions—i.e. politico-military, economic and environmental, and human—are matters of direct and legitimate concern to all participating states.</p>

               <heading>Politico-Military Dimension</heading>
               <p usage="edio casee">In June 1991 the first meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers (renamed in 1994 as the Ministerial Council), held in Berlin adopted a mechanism for consultation and co-operation in the case of emergency situations, to be implemented by the Council of Senior Officials (CSO; subsequently renamed the Senior Council, which was dissolved in 2006, with all functions transferred to the Permanent Council). A separate mechanism regarding the prevention of the outbreak of conflict was also adopted, whereby a country can demand an explanation of `unusual military activity' in a neighbouring country.</p>
               <p usage="edio casee">These mechanisms were utilized in July 1991 in relation to the armed conflict in Yugoslavia between the Republic of Croatia and the Yugoslav Government. In August a meeting of the CSO resolved to reinforce the CSCE's mission in Yugoslavia and in September the CSO agreed to impose an embargo on the export of armaments to Yugoslavia. In October the CSO determined to establish an observer mission to monitor the observance of human rights in Yugoslavia.</p>
               <p usage="edio">
        In January 1992 the Council of Foreign Ministers agreed to alter the Conference's rule of decision making by consensus in order to allow the CSO to take appropriate action against a participating state `in cases of clear and gross violation of CSCE commitments'. This development was precipitated by the conflict in Yugoslavia, where the Yugoslav Government was held responsible by the majority of CSCE states for the continuation of hostilities, and, consequently, suspended from the grouping. The meeting also agreed that the CSCE should undertake fact-finding and conciliation missions to areas of tension. The meeting of heads of state and of government, held in Helsinki, Finland, in July, adopted the Helsinki Document, in which participating states defined the terms of future CSCE peacekeeping activities. Conforming broadly to UN practice, operations would be undertaken only with the full consent of the parties involved in any conflict and only if an effective ceasefire were in place. The CSCE may request the use of the military resources of the 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="NATO.IO">North Atlantic Treaty Organization</xr>
         (NATO), the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the European Union (EU) or other international bodies. The Helsinki Document declared the CSCE a `regional arrangement' in the sense of Chapter VIII of the UN's Charter, which states that such a grouping should attempt to resolve a conflict in the region before referring it to the Security Council. The December 1994 summit conference, convened in Budapest, Hungary, adopted a Code of Conduct on Politico-Military Aspects of Security, which set out principles to guide the role of the armed forces in democratic societies. In December 1996 the summit conference convened in Lisbon, Portugal, adopted the Lisbon Declaration on a Common and Comprehensive Security Model for Europe for the 21st Century, committing all parties to pursuing measures to ensure regional security.
      </p>
               <p>The Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE), which had been negotiated within the framework of the CSCE, was signed in November 1990 by the member states of NATO and of the Warsaw Pact. The Treaty limits non-nuclear air and ground armaments in the signatory countries. The summit conference that was held in Lisbon, in December 1996 agreed to adapt the CFE Treaty, in order to further arms reduction negotiations on a national and territorial basis.</p>
               <p>In November 1999 OSCE heads of state and of government, convened in İstanbul, Türkiye (Turkey), signed a Charter for European Security, which aimed to strengthen co-operation with other organizations and institutions concerned with international security and to formalize existing norms regarding the observance of human rights. The Charter focused on measures to improve the oper­ational capabilities of the OSCE in early warning, conflict prevention, crisis management and post-conflict rehabilitation. Accordingly, a Rapid Expert Assistance and Co-operation Teams (REACT) programme became operational in April 2001. The 1999 summit meeting also adopted a revised Vienna Document on confidence- and security-building measures and a Platform for Co-operative Security as a framework for co-operation with other organizations and institutions concerned with maintaining security in the OSCE area.</p>
               <p>During OSCE’s November 1999 İstanbul summit the finalized Adapted CFE Treaty was signed, providing for a stricter system of limitations and increased transparency. A series of agreements or Commitments approved by the 1999 summit required Russia to withdraw forces from and reduce levels of military equipment in Georgia and Moldova, a process to be monitored by NATO. The Adapted Treaty was ratified by Belarus in 2000, by Kazakhstan in 2003, and by Russia in 2004. The Allied states, however, postponed ratification of the Adapted CFE Treaty pending Russia’s fulfilment of the 1999 Commitments. In December 2007, in view of the conditions that the NATO Allies had imposed in relation to their ratification of the Adapted CFE Treaty, the Russian Government suspended its obligations under the original CFE Treaty. In November 2011, in response to Russia’s continuing suspension of the CFE Treaty, NATO Allies also suspended certain of their obligations under the Treaty. Russia fully suspended participation in the CFE meetings framework in March 2015.</p>
               <p>In December 2016 the Ministerial Council adopted a Declaration on efforts to counter Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) and stockpiles of conventional armaments and the need for ongoing and increased collaborative activities in that field. At that time OSCE projects had contributed to the destruction of an estimated 50,000 weapons and 18,000 metric tons of conventional ammunition. In December 2018 the Council adopted a Declaration on OSCE Efforts in the Field of Norms and Best Practices on SALW and Stockpiles of Conventional Ammunition.</p>
               <p>In December 2001 the Ministerial Council, meeting in Romania, approved the Bucharest Plan of Action outlining the organization's contribution to countering terrorism. A Personal Representative for Terrorism was appointed by the CiO in January 2002. In December the Ministerial Council issued an OSCE Charter on Preventing Terrorism, which called upon member states to work together to counter, investigate and prosecute terrorist acts. The Charter also acknowledged the links between terrorism, organized crime and trafficking in human beings. </p>
               <p>In December 2011 the Ministerial Council, convened in Vilnius, Lithuania, determined to establish a Transnational Threats Department, incorporating an Action against Terrorism Unit, within the Secretariat to co-ordinate and strengthen the organization’s capacity with regard to terrorism, violent extremism and cyber- and border security.</p>
               <p>The 22nd Ministerial Council meeting, held in December 2015, adopted a declaration on preventing and countering violent extremism and radicalization that lead to terrorism, and in the following December the Ministerial Council adopted a declaration on strengthening OSCE terrorism prevention efforts. In May 2018 the OSCE helped to organize, with the Government of Tajikistan, the EU and the UN, an inaugural High-level International Conference on Countering Terrorism and Preventing Violent Extremism, in Dushanbe, Tajikistan (henceforth known as the Dushanbe Process). Within the framework of the Process a conference was convened in October 2022 on the theme `International and Regional Border Security and Management Cooperation to Counter Terrorism and Prevent the Movement of Terrorists’.</p>
               <p usage="edio ewyb eerca">Since 2003 an Annual Security Review Conference has been convened as a forum for high-level consideration of current security challenges and means of addressing them. The 2023 edition, held in June, addressed the theme `Restoring peace and security, engaging in dialogue and rebuilding trust—For the people’.</p>
               <p>During 2011 the Vienna Document 2011 (VDOC11) was formulated, with a focus on increasing openness and transparency relating to military activities, including exercises, conducted inside the OSCE's `zone of application’ (comprising all Europe and parts of Central Asia, including territory, air space, and surrounding sea areas). OSCE’s Conflict Prevention Centre facilitates the exchange of military information between member states within the VDOC11 framework and serves as the focal point for the systematic collection, collation, analysis and assessment of conflict early warning signals. The Centre also facilitates negotiation, mediation, and other conflict prevention and resolution efforts and supports post-conflict rehabilitation, in close co-operation with OSCE’s field missions. The Centre supports the OSCE Forum for Security Co-operation.</p>

               <p>In 1993 the first annual OSCE Economic Forum was convened to focus on the transition to and development of free market economies as an essential aspect of democracy building. In November 1997 the position of Co-ordinator of OSCE Economic and Environmental Activities was created. The annual Forum was renamed as the Economic and Environment Forum in May 2007 to incor­por­ate consideration of environmental security matters. The Concluding Meeting of the 2022 Forum process (which had followed a longstanding three-meeting format) was held in Prague, in September. Introducing a new format, a 2023 Conference on the Economic and Environmental Dimension of the OSCE, organized in June of that year, in Struga, North Macedonia (`Struga Conference’), focused on: good governance and anti-corruption; energy security and co-operation in addressing challenges caused by climate change; and connectivity through transport and trade facilitation. In October OSCE helped to organize the 6th Vienna Energy Security Dialogue, themed `Looking Ahead: Shaping the Post-Crises Global Energy Markets’.</p>

               <p>The organization’s `Human Dimension Mechanism’, a tool for protecting human rights in member states, comprises two parts. Through the Vienna Mechanism (established in 1989) member states may raise questions relating to the situation in other OSCE States. Through the Moscow Mechanism (established in 1991) participating states may establish ad hoc missions of independent experts to conduct investigations of alleged human rights abuses in a member states and to support the resolution of any specific human dimension issue. The Moscow Mechanism may be invoked without organization-wide consensus and independently of the OSCE Chairmanship and other institutions, at the behest of one member state if supported by at least nine other member states. By March 2024 it had been invoked on 15 occasions.</p>
               <p>ODIHR serves as the secretariat for the annual Human Dimension Conference (2023: Warsaw, in October), which provides a forum for government officials, experts and representatives of civil society to address issues of human rights and democracy. Supplementary Human Dimension Meetings may also be convened to debate specific topics. In 2023 Supplementary Meetings were held in March (to discuss the role of media freedom as a central pillar of regional security), in April (focused on combating torture and other grave breaches of international humanitarian law), and in June (to address the role of civil society organizations in promoting tolerance).</p>

An OSCE Action Plan on Improving the Situation of Roma and Sinti within the OSCE Area was endorsed by the Ministerial Council in December 2003. Status reports on the implementation of the Action Plan have been issued at five-yearly intervals. In August 2020, on the occasion of the 45th anniversary of the adoption of the Helsinki Final Act, ODIHR called for education on and remembrance of the genocide of up to 500,000 Roma and Sinti people perpetrated by the Nazi regime and its collaborators.</p>

               <p>In December 2003 the Ministerial Council adopted an Action Plan to Combat Trafficking in Human Beings, and approved the appointment of a Special Representative on Combating Trafficking in Human Beings, mandated to raise awareness of the issues and to ensure that member governments comply with international procedures and conventions. An Alliance against Trafficking in Persons was established under OSCE auspices in July 2004, with the aim of consolidating co-operation among international and non-governmental organizations. In December 2011 the Ministerial Council adopted a declaration on combating all forms of human trafficking.

                    <p usage="eerca">On 31 March 2011 the OSCE Office in Minsk closed, following a decision by the authorities in Belarus not to extend its mandate. The Office had opened in January 2003, as a successor to an OSCE Advisory and Monitoring Group, tasked with promoting institution-building, consolidating the rule of law, strengthening relations with civil society and assisting the Government of Belarus in developing economic and environmental activities. An OSCE observation mission dispatched to monitor legislative elections held in Belarus in September 2012 found that the elections had not been administered in an impartial manner. A team was dispatched in August 2016 to monitor legislative elections that were held in that country in early September.</p>
                    <p usage="ewyb edio eerca">
          Following the re-election in Belarus of President
          
           Alyaksandr Lukashenka in August 2020, the OSCE CiO expressed concern at the alleged use of force used against people protesting the outcome, as well as mass detentions and the obstruction of the activities of journalists. In September 17 OSCE member states invoked the Moscow Mechanism to examine the alleged commission of human rights abuses before, during and after the election: a report consequently issued in November found `massive and systematic’ violations of human rights by the Belarusian security forces, and that the election had been neither free nor fair. In May 2021 the OSCE CiO condemned the forced diversion by the Belarusian authorities of international passenger flight FR4978 to that country’s capital, Minsk, and the removal from the aircraft and arrest of a Belarusian journalist, Raman Pratasyevich, who had played a prominent role in covering the mass protests against Lukashenko. The CiO called for his immediate release, and for the Belarusian Government to respect human rights and independence of the media, and to provide an immediate explanation for their actions. Shortly before this incident the OSCE RFoM had issued a statement that deplored the imprisonment of several journalists and the `deeply disturbing’ treatment of media workers in Belarus. In August the RFoM deplored a recent decision by the Belarus Supreme Court to dissolve the Belarusian Association of Journalists (BAJ), which had hitherto independently represented media workers in that country, and had been raided and accused of violating legislation governing public associations. In March 2023 the RFoM condemned a recent decision by the Belarusian authorities to designate the BAJ as an `extremist formation’. Later in that month she deplored—as part of a wide-scale systematic pattern of persecution of journalists and of independent opinion in Belarus—terms of imprisonment issued by a court in Minsk against the Director-General and Editor-in-Chief of the Belarusian media portal TUT.BY, who had been convicted on charges of tax evasion. At that time 36 media workers remained detained in Belarus. Meanwhile, in that month OSCE/ODIHR stated deep concern over the imprisonment of four members of the Belarusian human rights organization Viasna (the outcome of the latest of a series of cases brought against human rights defenders in that country). The Moscow Mechanism was invoked, again, in that month by 38 member states to consider `threats to the fulfilment of the provisions of the human dimension posed by human rights violations and abuses’ in Belarus. In January 2024 ODIHR stated profound concern at a decision by the Belarusian authorities not to invite OSCE observers to monitor the parliamentary elections that were held in that country on 25 February. Just prior to the elections ODIHR issued a statement deploring the Belarusian authorities’ criminalization of human rights defenders, and stating grave concern at the continuing arrests of people who had participated in peaceful demonstrations in 2020-21, or who had engaged with anti-government social media content. The Belarusian authorities’ definition of `extremist activity’ was deemed to be poorly conceived.

                    <p usage="edio eerca">In late August 2018 16 OSCE member states (including Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the USA) informed the OSCE Permanent Council of a letter that they had sent to Russia’s delegation to the OSCE requesting information concerning credible reports of human rights violations and abuses perpetrated in Chechnya since January 2017. In November 2018 the delegations from the 16 countries stated concern at Russia’s response to the letter. Deeming Russia to be either unwilling or unable to address the reported abuses, and—finding this to be contributing to a climate of impunity in Chechnya, in contravention of the OSCE’s human dimension goals—they independently invoked the 1993 Moscow Mechanism (q.v.) to establish a team of experts to address these concerns. In December 2018 the Mechanism’s rapporteur presented a report and series of recommendations to the Permanent Council concerning the situation in Chechnya.</p>

                    <p usage="edio eerca">An OSCE Mission to Georgia was established in 1992 to work towards a political settlement between disputing factions within the country. The Mission’s mandate was expanded to include monitoring Georgia’s borders with Chechnya (in December 1999), Ingushetia (in December 2001), and Dagestan (January 2003). In August 2008 intensive fighting broke out when Georgian forces entered South Ossetia and attempted to seize control of its capital, Tskhinvali. The resulting counter-attack by Ossetian troops, supported by additional Russian land and air forces, contributed to extensive civilian casualties, population displacement and damage to the region’s infrastructure. The OSCE participated in diplomatic efforts to secure a ceasefire and expanded the Mission to Georgia by 100 unarmed military monitoring officers. The Mission to Georgia was terminated upon the expiry of its mandate on 31 December 2008, owing to Russia's insistence that it could only be continued with a new mandate excluding any arrangement sustaining Georgia’s territorial claims on South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and Georgia's opposition to this. In February 2009, however, the OSCE Permanent Council agreed to extend, until 30 June, the mandate of the OSCE unarmed monitors in Georgia. During 2011-13 the OSCE and the UN Development Programme undertook a joint ammunition demilitarization and community security programme in Georgia. In October 2012 an OSCE/ODIHR election observation team observed legislative elections held in Georgia. The elections were found to have significantly consolidated democracy, although the team considered the campaigning environment to have been tense and not to have focused sufficiently on concrete political programmes. Some instances of intimidation of party activists and supporters were reported. OSCE/ODIHR deployed an election observation mission to monitor a presidential election held in Georgia in October 2013.</p>
                    <p usage="ewyb edio eerca">The Special Representative of the OSCE CiO for the South Caucasus co-chairs, with the EU and the UN, the Geneva International Discussions on Georgia, which have been held regularly since late 2008. The 58th session of the Discussions was held in July 2023. Jointly, with the head of the EU Monitoring Mission in Georgia, the Special Representative also co-facilitates meetings of the Ergneti Incident Prevention and Response Mechanism (IPRM). The 117th IPRM meeting, convened in February 2024, in Ergneti (a village near the `Occupation Line’ bordering the Tskhinvali region), addressed the local security situation, urged the release of detainees, and called for full freedom of movement along the boundary line. Regular technical meetings are also held, in particular focusing on irrigation.</p>

                    <p usage="ewyb edio eerca">In March 2014 the OSCE Permanent Council determined immediately to deploy an OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) to Ukraine, tasked with gathering information on human rights, assessing the security situation, and fostering dialogue following the Russian invasion and subsequent annexation of Crimea. The inaugural meeting of a Trilateral Contact Group (TCG), comprising senior representatives from the OSCE, Ukraine and Russia, was held in early June to discuss the implementation of a peace plan for eastern Ukraine that had been proposed by a newly elected Ukrainian President. In late July the Permanent Council decided to deploy an OSCE Observer Mission at the Russian Checkpoints Gukovo and Donetsk, on the Russia-Ukraine border, as a confidence-building measure to help to reduce tensions during the ongoing crisis. The CiO welcomed the adoption on 5 September, in Minsk, Belarus, by the Ukrainian and Russian Governments, and opposition militia, of a protocol on respecting a ceasefire, and on initiating a political process aimed at resolving the crisis. The Minsk Protocol, which had been formulated by the TCG on the basis of the peace plan proposed in June, comprised a 12-point roadmap towards resolving the conflict, in accordance with which OSCE’s SMM was to supervise the ceasefire, internal dialogue was to be pursued by the parties to the conflict, and Ukraine was to legislate for a decentralization of power and for the introduction of provisional local arrangements for Donetsk and Luhansk, and was also to organize local elections there promptly. From early January 2015, in violation of the ceasefire agreed under the Minsk Protocol, separatist forces in Donetsk and Luhansk initiated a new offensive against government-controlled territory. In February the TCG, meeting in Minsk, under OSCE auspices, approved a Package of Measures for the Implementation of the Minsk Agreements, referred to as Minsk II, aimed at revitalizing the ceasefire. Working groups on security, economic, humanitarian and political issues were established under the auspices of the TCG, in accordance with a provision of the Package of Measures. In June, in response to continuing violence, the CiO urged all parties to abide by the Minsk Agreements and to negotiate a political resolution to the situation through the TCG and its working groups. In September the TCG finalized an Addendum to the February Package of Measures, providing for the withdrawal to a distance of 15 km for tanks, mortars and artillery pieces.</p>
                    <p>During 2016 an impasse in the Minsk process prevailed, as the Ukrainian authorities deplored continuing action in eastern regions by pro-Russia militia, and Russia accused Ukraine of stalling the implementation of political reforms. In July the Special Representative of the OSCE CiO in Ukraine and the SMM’s Chief Monitor both stated that measures needed to be taken by all sides in eastern Ukraine to ensure full respect for the ceasefire, and to spare civilians from violence. The Chief Monitor observed at that time that the SMM’s capacity to monitor and verify the withdrawal of weaponry, as mandated by the Minsk documents, was being compromised. Interference with and the destruction of the Mission’s unmanned aerial vehicles was noted. In December 2017 the OSCE CiO welcomed a large-scale exchange of detainees in eastern Ukraine between the Ukrainian authorities and Donetsk and Luhansk separatists (the self-identified Donetsk and Luhansk `People's Republics’).</p>
                    <p>In late November 2018 the Special Representative of the CiO in Ukraine and the Chief Monitor of the SMM jointly stated concern over escalating tensions in the Kerch Strait (linking Crimea to Russia). They urged Russia and Ukraine to exercise restraint and to resolve disputes through political and diplomatic channels. In late April 2019, in response to the election of Volodymyr Zelensky to the Ukrainian presidency at OSCE/ODIHR-monitored elections held in March-April, the OSCE Secretary-General urged new momentum in the implementation of the Minsk Agreements. In early March a prisoner swap was agreed under the auspices of the TCG. In mid-April the CiO and OSCE Secretary-General welcomed the mutual release and exchange of prisoners in eastern Ukraine. In late July 2020 the CiO welcomed an agreement reached by the TCG on the implementation of additional Measures to Strengthen the Ceasefire in eastern Ukraine. At the end that month, however, the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly President stated deep concern over reports of continuing violations of the ceasefire in the Donetsk region. The SMM’s mandate was extended at the end of March 2021 until 31 March 2022. The mandate of the OSCE Observer Mission at the Russian Checkpoints Gukovo and Donetsk was, however, terminated on 30 September 2021—its further extension having been prevented by the Russian authorities (which were accused by Ukraine of aiming to prevent observation of an ongoing build-up of Russian forces at the Russia-Ukraine border). In early 2022 the SMM reported that during 2021 it had recorded 93,902 ceasefire violations, 1,133 explosions, 1,892 incidents relating to the presence of weapons in violation of withdrawal lines, and 852 restrictions on movement.</p>
                    <p>On 21 February 2022 the OSCE CiO, Secretary-General, and the President and Secretary-General of the organization’s Parliamentary Assembly issued a joint statement in which they strongly condemned a decision by Russia—in contravention of the Minsk Agreements—to recognize the self-identified `People’s Republics’ of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent. They noted that this represented a breach of international law and of fundamental OSCE principles. At that time the Group of Seven (G7) member states issued a statement supporting the continuing implementation of the Minsk Agreements and the activities of the SMM—which by that time was reportedly recording several hundred ceasefire violations each day. On 22 February the Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered that Russian troops should enter the disputed territories. On 24 February Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In a joint statement the OSCE CiO and Secretary-General condemned Russia’s military action and urged its immediate cessation. In mid-March the OSCE CiO and the Secretary-General strongly condemned ongoing Russian violence against civilian areas across Ukraine, including the recent bombing of a theatre where several hundred civilians had been sheltering in the port city of Mariupol. On 3 March, after consultations with Ukraine, 45 OSCE member states had invoked the Moscow Mechanism (q.v.) to address the human rights and humanitarian impacts of the invasion. Accordingly, in mid-April a three-member mission (that had been appointed in mid-March) presented to the OSCE Permanent Council a report which found clear patterns demonstrating that the Russian forces had violated international law, as well as strong indications that crimes against humanity had been committed. The Moscow Mechanism was invoked again in June in connection with the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and in late July to establish an expert mission to assess, in the context of Russia’s OSCE human dimension commitments, that country’s legal and administrative practices.</p>
                    <p>From late March 2022 the OSCE CiO visited Moldova, Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, to discuss ongoing security challenges, and means of advancing co-operation, against the backdrop of Russia’s ongoing aggression against Ukraine. On 31 March the OSCE CiO and Secretary-General observed with regret the expiry of the mandate of the SMM, stating that the position of Russia had prevented the achievement by the Permanent Council of consensus on its renewal; the Mission’s mandated operations ceased from 1 April, although some administrative activities (with regard to maintaining the security of mission assets and personnel) continued. In late April the OSCE CiO and the Secretary-General called for the immediate release of four Ukrainian SMM members who had been detained in Donetsk and Luhansk. Soon afterwards the OSCE CiO and the Secretary-General jointly announced the initiation of the process of fully closing down the SMM. Russia also prevented the extension of the mandate of the Office of the OSCE Project Co-ordinator in Ukraine; this was terminated on 30 June. In July the Acting Head of the Mission reiterated calls for the release of SMM members who remained detained in non-government controlled areas of Donetsk and Luhansk. At the end of September the OSCE CiO, Secretary-General and Parliamentary Assembly President collectively denounced the illegal annexation by Russia of occupied Ukrainian territory. The 2022 meeting of the OSCE Ministerial Council, held in early December, focused on the immense security, energy and humanitarian challenges resulting from Russia’s ongoing war against Ukraine.</p>
                    <p>On 30 March 2023 the Moscow Mechanism was invoked to address `the Deportation of Children amidst Human Rights Violations and Humanitarian Impacts of Russia’s War of Aggression against Ukraine’. In May the Mechanism issued a series of recommendations to Russia and Ukraine, as well as to other states and to international organizations, focused on the safe reunification with their parents, relatives and rightful legal guardians of all Ukrainian children who had been forcibly removed by Russia. ODIHR’s Director reported in July 2023 that `deeply worrying’ credible evidence had been collected by the Office relating to human rights violations perpetrated during the ongoing conflict, including documented cases of summary executions, torture, and sexual-based violence. Reports of killings and ill-treatment of prisoners of war by both sides had been filed, and the Russian forces were reported to be routinely placing explosive weapons with wide area impacts in densely populated districts, causing numerous civilian casualties.</p>
                    <p>The ministers responsible for foreign affairs of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania refused to participate in the OSCE’s 30th Ministerial Council, in November-December 2023, to protest the participation of their Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov. Meanwhile, Russia and Belarus rejected Estonia’s chairmanship of the OSCE during 2024 (this was assumed by Malta).</p>
                    <p>In February 2024 45 OSCE member states invoked the Moscow Mechanism once again, to address Russia’s `arbitrary deprivation of liberty of Ukrainian civilians’.</p>

They concern the security and sovereignty of States as well as the stability of our societies. Human rights are not fully respected in all OSCE States. Ethnic tension, aggressive nationalism, violations of the rights of persons belonging to national minorities, as well as serious difficulties of economic transition, can threaten stability and may also spread to other States. Terrorism, organized crime, drug and arms trafficking, uncontrolled migration and environmental damage are of increasing concern to the entire OSCE community.</p>

Our approach is one of co-operative security based on democracy, respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law, market economy and social justice. It excludes any quest for domination. It implies mutual confidence and the peaceful settlement of disputes.</p>
