          <p id="PIF-SEC.IO.92">The first annual meeting of South Pacific heads of state and of government was held in August 1971, in Wellington, New Zealand. A secretariat was established (as the South Pacific Bureau for Economic Co-operation—SPEC) by an agreement signed in April 1973. SPEC was redesignated as the South Pacific Forum Secretariat in 1988, and the present name was adopted in October 2000, in order to reflect the expansion of its membership since its establishment. In October 2005 the 36th Forum adopted an Agreement Establishing the Pacific Islands Forum, which form­alized the grouping's status as a full intergovernmental organization.</p>

          <p>In February 2021 five Micronesian member states—Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru and Palau—declared their intention to withdraw from the Forum in protest at the recent selection process to appoint a new Secretary-General. (The conventional rotation of the role between candidates from Micronesia, Melanesia and Polynesia had been altered, exceptionally, to the disadvantage of the Micronesian sub-region.) Later in February the Federated States of Micronesia gave formal notice of its impending withdrawal from the Forum in February 2022, and in July 2021 Kiribati also gave one year’s notice of its withdrawal. In February 2022 the withdrawal of the Federated States of Micronesia was `paused’. A set of proposals to strengthen Micronesia’s presence within the Forum was reached in June (the `Suva Agreement’), including to replace the incumbent Secretary-General in 2024 by a Micronesian candidate. Nevertheless, in July 2022 Kiribati announced that it had completed its withdrawal from the grouping; the 51st Pacific Islands Forum session held in that month stated regret at this development and pledged to pursue options for closer diplomatic engagement with Kiribati. In January 2023 the Kiribati president announced that country’s intention to rejoin the Forum. This was confirmed at a Special Leaders’ Retreat held in Nadi, Fiji, in the following month.</p>

               <heading>2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent</heading>
               <p>In September 2017 the Forum endorsed `The Blue Pacific—Our Sea of Islands—Our Security through Sustainable Development, Management and Conservation’ as the core regional identity and driver of collective action. The Forum envisaged that the Blue Pacific concept would reaffirm the connections between the Pacific peoples and their natural resources, environment and cultural heritage, and would enhance their livelihoods. The Blue Pacific concept effectively superseded a previous Framework for Pacific Regionalism that had been initiated in 2014. In August 2019 the 50th Leaders’ Forum, in Funafuti, Tuvalu, endorsed the development of a 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent, a long-term framework aimed at enhancing regional security. The Forum agreed on the need for strong political leadership to advance (as informed by science) the following cornerstone priorities: climate change action; protecting the health and integrity of the Pacific Ocean; sustainably managing ocean and island resources; connecting the oceanic continent by air, sea and information and communications technology; and ensuring healthy people. The virtual Special Leaders’ Retreat that was held in February 2021 adopted a Pacific Islands Forum Leaders Ocean Statement 2020/21, which identified securing the limits of the Blue Pacific Continent against the threats of sea-level rise and climate change as the defining issues in effecting the Blue Pacific Continent vision. In September 2022 the Forum’s Secretary-General presented the 2050 Strategy to global leaders at the UN General Assembly. In November 2023 the 52nd Forum endorsed an implementation plan for the Strategy, and also endorsed a Pacific Partnerships for Prosperity (PPfP) initiative, focused on mobilizing resources to enable transformational change in the region.</p>

The Framework provided for the creation of a network of national marine reserves. A Pacific Ocean Alliance was established by the Forum Secretariat in September 2014, tasked with strengthening effective regional ocean policy co-ordination and implementation, and with supporting national ocean governance and policy processes, within the Framework for a Pacific Oceanscape.</p>
               <p usage="fea">In August 2012, during the 43rd Forum, the Cook Islands inaugurated a new national marine protected zone which, measuring 1.1m. sq km, represented at that time the largest such marine reserve in the world. At the 2012 Forum the leaders of the Cook Islands, Niue, Kiribati, Tokelau, Tuvalu, Nauru and the Marshall Islands signed eight maritime boundary agreements, while Kiribati, the Marshall Islands and Nauru adopted a trilateral treaty relating to the intersection of the exclusive economic zones of the three countries (known as the tri-junction point).</p>

        In September 2014 the Third International Conference on Small Island Developing States, hosted by Samoa, in its capital, Apia, adopted the Small Island Developing States Accelerated Modalities of Action (`SAMOA Pathway’) plan on building resilience, augmenting partnerships, and renewing commitment to sustainable development, during the period 2014-24. A High-Level Mid-Term Review of the SAMOA Pathway was held in September 2019, at a special session of the UN General Assembly, in New York, USA. A Pacific Small Island Development Fund aims to assist the economic development of SIS member countries through project financing. In September 2015 the 46th Forum committed to implementing—in the context of Pacific Ocean commitments, including the SAMOA Pathway—the 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-UNDP.001">UN 2030 Agenda</xr>
         and associated Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs—including SDG 14: Conserve and sustainably use oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development). In September 2017 the 48th Forum endorsed a Pacific Roadmap for Sustainable Development, and 132 related Pacific Sustainable Development Indicators. In December 2022 the Forum Secretariat and the 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-UN.961">UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific</xr>
         jointly organized the Sixth Pacific Forum on Sustainable Development, in Suva. A follow-on framework to the SAMOA Pathway was to be adopted by the 4th International Conference on SIDS, to be held in late May 2024, in Antigua and Barbuda.

               <p>In September 2017 the Forum leaders urged the initiation of UN negotiations on drafting an Implementing Agreement on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biodiversity in Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ). The inaugural session of an Intergovernmental Conference on the BBNJ was convened in September 2018. The Forum Secretary-General welcomed the eventual formal adoption of a BBNJ Treaty in June 2023; it was opened for signature in September, and required 60 ratifications to enter into force.</p>

        The second

               <p>The Forum leaders agreed in September 2017 to advance the development of policies aimed at banning single-use plastic bags and styrofoam packaging, and to urge Pacific Rim partners likewise to commit to reducing marine debris and pollution. In August 2019 the 50th Forum affirmed its commitment to establishing a regional mechanism to address oil spills. A Pacific Regional Action Plan on Marine Litter was being implemented during 2018-25.</p>
               <p>In September 1995 the 26th Forum adopted the Waigani Convention, banning the import into the region of all radioactive and other hazardous wastes, and providing controls for the transboundary movement and management of these wastes. Forum leaders have frequently reiterated protests against the shipment of radioactive materials through the region.</p>
               <p>The Forum and the Government of Japan jointly launched a Pacific Environment Community (PEC) Fund in May 2009; this is managed by the Forum Secretariat, and supports projects with a focus on sea water desalination and solar power generation.</p>

               <p>The Forum actively promotes the development of effective international legislation to reduce emissions by industrialized countries of greenhouse gases (that contribute to the warming of the Earth's atmosphere and to related increases in global sea levels). The Secretariat has played an active role in supporting regional participation at meetings of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the UNFCCC. With support from the Australian Government, it administers a network of stations to monitor sea levels and climate change throughout the Pacific region.</p>
               <p>The Forum has adopted several declarations aimed at advancing reductions in emissions and increased use of renewable energy sources and climate adaptation technologies—including the August 2008 Niue Declaration on Climate Change; the September 2013 Majuro Declaration for Climate Leadership; and the September 2015 Pacific Islands Forum Leaders Declaration on Climate Change Action. In August 2019 the 50th Forum issued the Kainaki II Declaration for Urgent Climate Action Now as the basis of the Forum’s leadership and moral authority in its subsequent engagement in international negotiations on climate change. This stated strong support for the 2015 Paris Agreement and recent scientific research by the International Panel on Climate Change. A Declaration on Preserving Maritime Zones in the Face of Climate Change-related Sea-level Rise and a related Aide-Memoire were endorsed by the Pacific leaders in August 2021. In July 2022 the Forum leaders commended an initiative by Vanuatu that aimed to secure an International Court of Justice advisory opinion on the legal consequences of climate change. In November 2023 the creation of the role of Energy Commissioner for a Just Transition to a Fossil Fuel Free Pacific was approved by the 52nd Leaders’ Forum. The 52nd Forum also endorsed a Pacific Regional Framework on Climate Mobility, which upheld Pacific people’s fundamental priority to `stay in place’ in their ancestral homes, to be achieved by means that included land reclamation.</p>
               <p>The Forum Secretariat was accredited as an observer at the Green Climate Fund in March 2016.</p>
               <p>A Regional Conference on Securing the Limits of the Blue Pacific, addressing legal and institutional responses to the impact of sea level rises, was convened (in a virtual format) in September 2020. In the following month Samoa hosted the virtual 2020 Pacific Ocean Pacific Climate Change Conference (the third in a series), addressing `science, people and oceans’.</p>
               <p>A Strategy for Climate and Disaster Resilient Development in the Pacific (SRDP), covering the period 2016-35, and Pacific Resilience Partnership (PRP—the co-ordinating mechanism of the SRDP) were initiated in January 2016. The Forum Secretariat, SPC and SPREP collectively maintain a PRP Support Unit. A Pacific Resilience Program (PREP) was initiated in June 2016 as a joint initiative of the Forum Secretariat, SPC, and the World Bank. In September 2017 the 47th Forum endorsed a Framework for Resilient Development in the Pacific (FRDP): an Integrated Approach to Address Climate Change and Disaster Risk Management, which aimed to ensure the involvement of communities at local, national and regional level in pursuing sustainable development and in building resilience. In August 2019 the 50th Forum noted the need for the PRP to address risks posed by chemical, medical and technological and other solid waste. The Forum also endorsed a new Pacific Resilience Facility (PRF), to provide small project grants to Pacific communities. The governance arrangements for the PRP were subsequently extended until 2030. February 2022 the Forum Secretariat and the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Insurance Company (PCRIC) confirmed a new collaboration, which was to include the appointment of a Forum PCRIC Regional Coordinator.</p>

               <p>The Forum Secretariat extends advice and technical assistance to member countries in policy, development, economic analysis, planning, structural reforms, export marketing, and information dissemination. Trade policy activities are mainly concerned with enhancing private sector processes, for example investment promotion, assisting integration into the world economy, and the development of businesses. A Forum office was opened in Geneva, Switzerland, in 2004 to represent member countries at the WTO. A biennial Forum Trade Ministerial Meeting format was introduced from 2021, to address regional pathways for strengthening supply chains, and to enhance economic resilience and solidarity. A Pacific Islands Forum COVID-19 Economic Recovery Taskforce was initiated in August 2020.</p>
               <p>A Regional Legislative and Regulatory Framework for Deep Sea Minerals Exploration was introduced in 2012. A Regional Roadmap for Sustainable Pacific Fisheries was endorsed by the Pacific leaders in September 2015. They also determined to prioritize increasing the sustainable economic returns of fisheries—including the possible development of a quota management system.</p>
               <p>
        Two major regional trade accords entered into force in April 2003 and October 2002, respectively: the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement (PICTA), providing for the establishment of a Pacific Island free trade area (FTA); and the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations (PACER). In September 2004, within the framework of PACER, Forum trade officials adopted measures concerned with customs procedures, quarantine, standards and other activities to harmonize and facilitate trade between Pacific Island states and international trading partners. A PICTA Protocol on trade in services was opened for signature in August 2012; by 2024 it was not yet in force. In June 2017 a new PACER-Plus arrangement was signed by Australia, the Cook Islands, Kiribati, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Tuvalu. Vanuatu signed in September. PACER-Plus provisions covered, 
        <i>inter alia,</i>
         goods, services, labour, investment, and sanitary and phytosanitary measures. PACER-Plus provided access for the Pacific island countries and territories (PICTs) to the larger markets of Australia and New Zealand, while obliging the PICTs gradually to reduce import tariffs and to liberalize incoming investment and trade. Generally tariffs were to be fully eliminated by 2042. A delayed 25-year tariff reduction schedule, however, commencing in 2028, was to be applied to the least developed country (LDC) signatory states—Kiribati, Solomon Islands and Tuvalu. Fiji and Papua New Guinea had declined to adopt PACER-Plus, deeming its provisions to be disadvantageous. Development assistance was to be extended to the signatory PICTs, for a five-year period, under a PACER-Plus Implementation Package. PACER-Plus entered into force on 13 December 2020. Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu participate in the Melanesian Spearhead Group Free Trade Agreement.

               <p>In September 2019 the Forum Secretariat launched a Pacific Regional Quality Infrastructure Initiative, which aimed to strengthen regional and national institutions in order to ensure that goods and services produced in the Pacific region meet defined international trade standards.</p>
               <p usage="fea">In April 2010 a meeting of Forum ministers responsible for trade established a regional umbrella body, Pacific Islands Trade and Invest, to develop and promote regional export and investment opportunities and tourism potential. In July 2014 a Pacific Regional Trade and Development Facility—an autonomous mechanism through which to channel trade-related development aid—became operational, having been endorsed by 10 Pacific Island states.</p>
               <p>A Pacific Aid for Trade (PAfT) Strategy, covering 2020-25, was developed by the Forum, with the following priority areas: finance, tourism and transport, telecommunications, electronic commerce, connectivity, trade facilitation and the development of quality infrastructure.</p>

               <p>A Forum Regional Security Committee, comprising senior government officials, meets annually to address security issues. In October 2000 leaders attending the 31st Forum adopted the Biketawa Declaration, which outlined a mechanism for responding to security crises, while also urging members to undertake efforts to address the fundamental causes of potential instability. The 49th Forum, held in Yaren, Nauru, in September 2018, issued the Boe Declaration on Regional Security, in which Pacific leaders reaffirmed endorsement of the Biketawa Declaration, and recognized that climate change remained the `single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and wellbeing of the peoples of the Pacific’—thereby explicitly linking environmental concerns to regional security. The Boe Declaration reiterated collective commitment to advancing the implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change that was adopted in December 2015 by the parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and affirmed the Forum countries’ stewardship of the Blue Pacific. It recognized an expanded concept of security addressing a wide range of issues, with an increasing emphasis on: Climate security; Human security (including humanitarian assistance); Environmental and resource security; Transnational crime; and Cybersecurity. A Boe Declaration Action Plan was endorsed by the 50th Forum in August 2019. </p>
               <p>The Biketawa Declaration was invoked by Forum ministers responsible for foreign affairs in April 2020, convened in an emergency (virtual) meeting to discuss a joint response to the COVID-19 crisis. A new regional mechansim, the PHP-C, was established, to be supported by a Regional Taskforce, the Forum Secretariat, the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC), and other relevant agencies, under the supervision of a Ministerial Action Group. In August, on behalf of the Forum and of the PHP-C, the World Food Programme deployed its UN Humanitarian Air Service to the region for the first time, to deliver essential medical supplies to Papua New Guinea.</p>

               <p>In July 2022 at the 51st Forum the Pacific island leaders determined to pursue a unified approach in evaluating competing efforts by China and the USA to invest in and cultivate influence in the region. The leaders pledged to engage in collective consultations prior to entering into external security arrangements. At that time the Forum’s Secretary-General noted member states’ collective rejection of an approach by China, whereby in May 10 of the Forum’s member states had been asked to endorse a security and trade arrangement with that country without prior intra-Pacific consultations. In September the inaugural US-Pacific Islands Summit was convened in Washington, DC, USA, with participation by US President Joe Biden and the heads of government of the Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, French Polynesia, Nauru, New Caledonia, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Republic of the Marshall Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. Australia and New Zealand attended the summit as observers. Taking into account the framework of the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent, a US-Pacific Declaration was issued that detailed the following collective priorities: strengthening the US-Pacific partnership; advancing Pacific regionalism; addressing the global climate crisis; enhancing co-operation to promote sustainable development and economic growth; improving disaster preparedness; protecting the Blue Pacific; maintaining peace and security; continuing to co-operate on COVID-19 and other health-related issues; expanding equality of opportunity; and promoting nuclear non-proliferation. A US-Pacific Island Country Trade and Investment Dialogue was initiated in February 2023, in a virtual format. A US-Pacific Islands Forum Leaders Dialogue was convened in May 2023, in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea. The second US-Pacific Islands Summit was held in September, on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly; the Solomon Islands declined to participate. At the event the USA announced investments of US&#8201;$40,000m. in the Pacific region.</p>
               <p usage="edio fea">In late November 2021 the Secretary-General stated deep regret at violent unrest that had erupted in Honiara (Solomon Islands), leading to three fatalities. He emphasized the importance of rule of law and of the safety of all communities. In July 2023 the Solomon Islands and China concluded an agreement aimed at boosting the Solomon Islands’ national security capacity.</p>
               <p>In February 2024 the Secretary-General expressed concern over the recent eruption of violence in Enga, Papua New Guinea, that had resulted in nearly 50 fatalities. He urged all parties to seek a peaceful resolution of the unrest.</p>
               <p>Since 2001 the Forum has sent observer groups to monitor elections taking place in member states.</p>

        The Honiara Declaration on Law Enforcement Co-operation, adopted by the Forum 1992, stated that security was a prerequisite for attaining the goal of balanced regional economic and social development. An Apia, Samoa-based Pacific Transnational Crime Coordination Centre was established in 2004, to enhance and gather law enforcement intelligence. The Forum Secretariat co-ordinates the Pacific Transnational Crimes Assessment, which identifies emerging criminal trends and threats to the region, including money laundering, and illegal movements of people, wildlife, goods and narcotics. The Secretariat contributed to 
        <publ-name>Transnational Organized Crime (TOC) in the Pacific: A Threat Assessment,</publ-name>

               <p usage="edio fea">In July 1995, following a decision of the French Government to resume testing of nuclear weapons in French Polynesia, members of the Forum resolved to increase diplomatic pressure on the Governments of France, the United Kingdom and the USA to accede to the 1986 South Pacific Nuclear-Free Zone Treaty (Treaty of Rarotonga). France ended the testing programme in January 1996, and the three countries signed the Treaty in March. In September 2013 the 44th Forum stated support for bilateral and multilateral action to assist the Marshall Islands in its efforts to achieve a just resolution to the issue of long-term environmental contamination caused by post-Second World War nuclear tests conducted there by the USA.</p>
               <p>Pacific leaders have repeatedly raised serious concerns over plans approved by Japan (in April 2021) to discharge into the Pacific Ocean, over a period of around 30 years, more than 1.25m. metric tons of radioactive wastewater that was stored at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant site. In March 2022 a PIF Independent Panel of Experts was established to provide technical advice on the wastewater plans (which were termed by the Forum Secretariat’s Secretary-General as a transboundary and intergenerational issue requiring a precautionary approach). Forum officials visited Japan in May 2022 and February 2023 to discuss the matter, and the Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) briefed the Forum on the situation in June 2021 and regularly thereafter. In January 2023 the PIF Independent Panel of Experts convened a public seminar on the Fukushima nuclear waste legacy. The fifth Forum-Japan meeting on Fukushima wastewater was convened in June, supported by a Forum-IAEA technical dialogue. In July the Forum Chair received a high-level mission from the IAEA, which presented a final report that concluded that treated water from the Fukushima Daiichi plant met international safety standards (a conclusion that was not fully supported by the PIF Independent Panel of Experts—which, in addition to ongoing nuclear standards, gave consideration to broader oceanic, environmental and human health safety standards). The inaugural meeting of the Forum Troika, convened on 18 August, gave consideration to an announcement by the Japanese authorities that the discharge of treated water would commence on 24 August. The Troika took note of the IAEA’s recent conclusions. The Forum Chair, meanwhile, issued a statement in which he drew attention to the divergent findings of the IAEA and PIF Panel, and committed to the continuation of dialogue on the matter. (The Japanese authorities began to release the treated water, as scheduled, on 24 August.) In September Forum ministers responsible for foreign affairs issued a statement that welcomed a proposal by the IAEA to establish an annual dialogue mechanism to evaluate the situation.</p>
               <p>The first meeting of the states parties of the 1986 South Pacific Nuclear-Free Zone Treaty (Treaty of Rarotonga), prohibiting the acquisition, stationing or testing of nuclear weapons in the region, was convened in December 2021, under the auspices of the Forum Secretariat.</p>
