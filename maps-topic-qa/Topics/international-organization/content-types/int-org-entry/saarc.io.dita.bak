          <p id="SAARC.IO.789" usage="sasia edio">The first summit meeting of SAARC heads of state and government, held in Dhaka, Bangladesh, in December 1985, resulted in the signing of the Charter of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. The SAARC Charter stipulates that decisions should be made unani­mously, and that `bilateral and contentious issues' should not be discussed. In August 1993 ministers of foreign affairs of seven countries, meeting in New Delhi, India, adopted a Declaration on South Asian Regional Cooperation.</p>
          <p usage="edio sasia">In April 2010 the 16th SAARC summit meeting determined to organize a South Asia Forum in which to exchange ideas on future regional development. The inaugural meeting of the Forum took place in New Delhi, in September 2011, with a focus on achieving progress towards a South Asian Economic Union (SAEU). The 17th SAARC summit, convened in November 2011, in Addu City, Maldives, adopted the Addu Declaration on `Building Bridges’, urging the future strengthening of SAARC mechanisms, including the Secretariat and Regional Centres. Meeting in November 2014 SAARC heads of state and of government adopted the Kathmandu Declaration on Deeper Integration for Peace and Prosperity, in which they determined to intensify co-operation.</p>
          <p>In October 2016 the Pakistan authorities announced the postponement of the 19th SAARC summit meeting—which had been scheduled to be held in November, in Islamabad—in view of the withdrawal of participation by Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal. India cited as the grounds for its non-participation an escalation in cross-border terrorist attacks in the region. Tensions between Pakistan and India mounted in early 2019, when a suicide bombing in Pulwama (in Indian Administered Kashmir), that was apparently perpetrated by the Pakistan-based militant grouping Jaish-e Mohammed, killed at least 40 members of the Indian security forces. Soon afterwards, in retaliation, India fired on a militant camp in Pakistan, and, subsequently, the Pakistan military shot down two Indian military planes and captured an Indian pilot (who was later released). The SAARC regular summit meeting remained postponed. Efforts to revitalize high-level regional collaboration were further undermined by the assumption of power in Afghanistan in August 2021 by the Taliban regime, which no other SAARC member state has recognized.</p>
          <p>It was envisaged that the appointment in 2023 of a new SAARC Secretary-General would help to revitalize the co-operation format. On 9 December (the annual commemoration of SAARC Charter Day), the member states’ heads of government issued statements that reaffirmed their commitment to the organization.</p>

        The SAARC Agricultural Centre, established in 1998 as the SAARC Agricultural Information Centre and given a broader mandate and renamed in 2006, aims to interlink relevant agricultural research, innovation, technology transfer and information networks, and policy makers, in
        
         member states. An Intergovernmental Agreement establishing a SAARC Food Bank (comprising wheat and rice) was signed by leaders attending the 14th summit meeting in April 2007. The Food Bank was reportedly activated in 2020, at the request of Bhutan, and in mid-2022 for Sri Lanka. In November 2011 the 17th SAARC summit adopted an agreement on the establishment of a SAARC Seed Bank, aimed at enhancing regional agricultural productivity. A SAARC Vaccine Bank and SAARC Livestock Gene Bank were both endorsed in November 2014 by the 18th summit. A common gene bank for vulnerable fish stocks has also been proposed.

               <p>In March 2018 the Chief Veterinary Officers (CVOs) of SAARC member states adopted a roadmap towards eliminating Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR) in the region by 2028. In June 2019 the CVOs issued a Statement on SAARC’s Co-operation on Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR), and endorsed an accompanying action plan for eliminating AMR. In July the CVOs identified Brucellosis (a bacterial disease affecting cattle), Newcastle disease (in poultry) and Rabies as new animal disease challenges to the region, while listing African Swine Fever among emerging threats.</p>
               <p>A SAARC Partnership Action Plan on Land and Soil Management and Water Use Efficiency for Sustainable Intensification of Agriculture in South Asia was being implemented during 2017-25.</p>

               <p>In January 2004 SAARC heads of state and of government signed an Agreement on the establishment of a South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA—superseding a SAARC Preferential Trading Arrangement, effective since 1995). SAFTA entered into force on 1 January 2006, with its Trade Liberalization Programme entering into effect on 1 July. The Agreement provided for the phased elimination of tariffs: to 30% in least developed member countries and to 20% in the others over an initial two-year period, and subsequently to 0%-5% over a period of five years.</p>
               <p>In November 2014 the 18th SAARC summit meeting decided to address the following new areas of co-operation: `blue’ (marine) economy, co-operatives, and labour migration.</p>
               <p usage="edio sasia">A SAARC Trade Fair was held in November 2017, in Colombo, to promote intra-SAARC commerce, and the sixth SAARC Business Leaders’ Conclave was convened in Kathmandu, in March 2018.</p>
               <p>A Visa Exemption Scheme, exempting 24 specified categor­ies of person from visa requirements, with the aim of promoting closer intraregional contact, became operational in March 1992. In February 2011 a meeting of SAARC ministers responsible for foreign affairs agreed to introduce long-term multi-entry visas for certain business people, sports people and journalists. In June 2015 Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal signed an accord providing for the free movement of people and cargo across their borders. They also determined to advance co-operation in areas including road and air connectivity, power, trade facilitation, and the movement of goods and services.</p>
               <p>In April 2017 Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka, with Myanmar, launched the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) vision, representing a roadmap until 2025 for increased subregional development and connectivity.</p>

An Additional Protocol, on preventing the financing of terrorist activities, was adopted in January 2002. A SAARC Convention on Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances entered into effect in November 1993. In January 2002, at the 11th SAARC summit, member states adopted a Convention on Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Women and Children for Prostitution. In August 2008 a SAARC Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters was adopted.</p>

        A SAARC Energy Centre, based in Islamabad, Pakistan, was established in March 2006. In November 2011 the 17th SAARC summit directed that member states should channel an appropriate percentage of national income towards renewable energy investments. A SAARC Framework Agreement for Energy Co-operation (Electricity) was adopted by the 18th SAARC summit meeting in November 2014. In 2021 studies were undertaken on, 
        <i>inter alia,</i>
         cross-border electricity trade pricing in South Asia; developing a handbook on establishing national power exchanges; mini-grids and electricity access; the solarization of streetlights in the SAARC region to enhance energy efficiency; and renewable energy for food storage.

        In April 2010 SAARC leaders issued the Thimphu Statement on Climate Change, in which they agreed,
        <i> inter alia,</i>
         to establish clear policy direction and guidelines for regional co-operation on climate change; to arrange for 10m. trees to be planted in the region; to formulate national plans, and, when appropriate, regional projects, aimed at protecting and safeguarding the SAARC region's archaeological and historical infrastructure from the adverse effects of climate change; and to commission SAARC intergovernmental initiatives on the marine and mountain ecosystems, on evolving monsoon patterns, and on climate-related disasters.

               <p>A reconstituted SAARC Disaster Management Centre (SDMC) was launched in November 2016 , incorporating the SAARC Centres responsible for meteorological research, forestry, and coastal zone management into the existing SDMC (established in 2006). By March 2024 the Centre had organized 30 capacity building initiatives, including (in that month) a workshop that addressed extreme heat preparedness and management. A SAARC Agreement on Rapid Response to Natural Disasters was adopted in November 2011 by the 17th SAARC summit, and entered into force in September 2016. In late 2015 the inaugural SAARC joint disaster management exercise was held near New Delhi.</p>

        A SAARC Tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS Centre was inaugurated in November 2007, in Kathmandu (the 31st session of its Governing Board was convened in January 2024, after a three-year hiatus). The sixth meeting of SAARC health ministers, convened in July 2017, adopted the Colombo Declaration, detailing recommendations on, 
        <i>inter alia</i>
        , addressing non-communicable diseases and vector-borne infections, improving sanitation, and promoting traditional medicine as well as human resources in the regional health sector. In mid-March 2020 the SAARC leaders (with the Pakistani Prime Minister represented by a health adviser) participated in a videoconference, called at the request of the Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, to discuss collective means of containing the spread of COVID-19 in the region. A regional COVID-19 Emergency Fund was established, under the auspices of the Indian Government, to be financed by voluntary contributions, including an initial US&#8201;$10m. allocation from India. The SAARC leaders agreed to pursue a process of consultations, at both ministerial and experts’ level, to address the long-term economic consequences of the pandemic on the region. At the instigation of Pakistan, SAARC health ministers met in April , by videoconference, to address means of combating the pandemic emergency. In early April Pakistan offered to donate $3m. to Emergency Fund, on condition that the initiative should be administered by the SAARC Secretariat; India rejected the proposition.
