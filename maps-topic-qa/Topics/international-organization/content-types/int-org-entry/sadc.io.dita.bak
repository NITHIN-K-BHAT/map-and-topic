          <p id="SADC.IO.4">The first Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC) was held in July 1979, to harmonize development plans and to reduce the region's eco­nomic dependence on South Africa. In August 1992 the 10 member countries of the SADCC signed a Treaty establishing the SADC, which replaced the SADCC upon its entry into force in October 1993. The Treaty places binding obligations on member countries, with the aim of promoting economic integration towards a fully developed common market. The Treaty was amended in 2001 to institutionalize closer social and political co-operation.</p>

               <heading>SADC Tribunal</heading>
               <p>The creation of an SADC Tribunal was provided for under the Treaty establishing SADC and facilitated by a protocol adopted in 2000. A 10-member Tribunal, located in Windhoek, Namibia, was eventually inaugurated in November 2005. In 2010—following a Tribunal judgment that declared as invalid and as a contravention of the SADC Treaty actions by the Zimbabwe Government to expropriate private land without compensation—the SADC summit meeting suspended the functioning of the Tribunal pending a review of its operations and terms of reference. In August 2012 SADC heads of state and of government determined to limit jurisdiction of a new Tribunal to disputes between member states arising from the Treaty, excluding individuals or private companies from seeking its ­arbitration. In August 2014 SADC heads of state and government adopted a protocol establishing a new Tribunal with more limited powers. By 2024, however, this protocol had not entered into force, and the Tribunal remained suspended. In December 2018 South Africa’s Constitutional Court ruled that the role of that country’s President in SADC’s decision to abolish the original Tribunal and to sign the replacement protocol was unconstitutional and `irrational’, and he was therefore directed to remove his signature from the 2014 protocol—it was withdrawn in August 2019. In June 2019 the Tanzania High Court ruled against that Government’s participation in the 2010 decision to suspend the original Tribunal.</p>

          <p>In March 2001 heads of state and of government endorsed an SADC Common Agenda, which covered the promotion of poverty reduction measures and of sustainable and equitable socioeconomic development, the advancement of democratic political values and systems, and the consolidation of peace and security. Furthermore, the establishment of an integrated committee of ministers was authorized, mandated to formulate and oversee a Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan (RISDP), intended as the key policy framework for managing the SADC Common Agenda; the finalized RISDP (which was open to subsequent revision) was approved by SADC heads of state and of government in August 2003. An updated RISDP covering 2020-30, and an SADC Vision 2050—together forming part of an SADC Post-2020 Agenda—were approved by the summit meeting held in August 2020. The RISDP (2020-30) was based on the `foundation’ of Peace, Security and Good Governance, and comprised three interrelated pillars: Industrial Development and Market Integration; Infrastructure Development in Support of Regional Integration; and Social and Human Capital Development. Gender, Youth, Environment and Climate Change, and Disaster Risk Management were cross-cutting components. The operationalization was pending in 2024 of an SADC Regional Development Fund (RDF).</p>

               <p>The SADC Protocol on Trade, providing for the establishment of a regional free trade area (FTA), through the gradual elimination of tariff barriers, entered into force in January 2000 (and was subsequently amended). Some 85% of intra-SADC trade tariffs were withdrawn by 1 January 2008, and the SADC FTA was formally inaugurated in August. (Angola and the DRC remained outside of the FTA in 2024, having not yet signed the Protocol.) In January 2012 the withdrawal of tariffs for sensitive products was finalized. A Protocol on Trade in Services was adopted in the following August; it entered into effect in January 2022. The planned SADC customs union had not yet been effected by 2024. Monetary union and a single currency were to be introduced following its establishment. Technical working groups were created in 2007 to facilitate the development of policy frameworks in legal and institutional arrangements; revenue collection, sharing and distribution; policy harmonization; and a common external tariff. In March 2016 a Trade Facilitation Programme (TFP) was introduced; in November 2021 the TFP was extended until 2030 by ministers responsible for trade.

In the following month SADC leaders condemned the massacre perpetuated by the Islamic State-linked Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) in eastern DRC, noting that the ADF was a terrorist grouping that posed a danger to the wider region. In October SADC congratulated all parties in the DRC for concluding an agreement to establish a transitional coalition government. The OPDS sent a fact-finding mission in that month to assess political and security developments in the DRC, and a follow-up mission in April 2017. In August SADC heads of state and of government appointed a Special Envoy to the DRC. In December the SADC Executive Secretary condemned an attack in Semuliki, eastern DRC, that resulted in the deaths, among others, of 15 FIB peacekeepers. The Executive Secretary led a political assessment mission to the DRC in January-February 2018, and an SADC liaison office was opened in the capital Kinshasa in March. In mid-2018 a joint SADC-UN task force was deployed to review the FIB; it recommended reconfiguring the Brigade to achieve a more agile and flexible structure. A 94-member SEOM was deployed to the country to oversee campaigning and voting in the presidential, legislative and provincial elections that were held on 30 December. In early January 2019 the OPDS, following disputed results of the presidential poll, recommended all parties to pursue negotiations to establish a government of national unity. An SADC `double troika’ summit of heads of state and government, convened in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in mid-January, to address the situation in the DRC, reaffirmed its commitment to supporting the DRC’s political processes, and to the goal of supporting the neutralization of the militant insurgency in that country. At that time the ICGLR, SADC and AU Chairpersons determined to dispatch a joint high-level delegation to the DRC to liaise with national stakeholders on means of resolving the post-electoral crisis. Soon afterwards, however, despite continuing evidence of irregularities in the electoral process, Félix Tshisekedi was declared the victor in the presidential poll and promptly inaugurated. In August the 39th SADC summit noted continuing acts of extremism and terrorism in the DRC, in particular in the Beni area of North Kivu, and agreed to co-operate closely with the ICGLR to advance security stabilization efforts in the Great Lakes Region. In August 2020 the OPDS protested a unilateral UN decision to reconfigure the FIB and to include non-SADC forces in the format, with the aim of enhancing its effectiveness. Eventually, in November, however, a special summit of the Organ approved the amendments. The revitalized FIB comprised three SADC region battlegroups (from Malawi, Tanzania and South Africa) and four Quick Reaction Forces (`QRFs’, from Kenya, Nepal, South Africa and Tanzania), as well as new intelligence units. In April 2022 SADC and other PSCF guarantors strongly condemned attacks in eastern DRC perpetrated by former M23 militants, urged them to silence their guns, and reiterated commitment to supporting progress towards peace in that country. (In April 2022, following the DRC’s admittance to the 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="WB0231XB.IO.TXT.73">EAC</xr>
         in March, that body determined to organize a dialogue with armed groups active in eastern areas of the DRC, and to deploy a force there should the militants fail to comply.) At the end of January 2023 an extraordinary troika summit of SADC heads of state or of government strongly condemned an escalation of armed violence and conflict in eastern DRC, including an upsurge in the activities of the M23, and also condemned foreign assistance to militant groups. The SADC leaders pledged to initiate dialogue among states with troop deployments in the DRC, with a view to enhancing their co-ordination. In early May an extraordinary troika summit with the heads of state of FIB contributing countries agreed to deploy troops to eastern DRC, within the SADC SF framework, while urging a cessation of hostilities by all parties in that region. The summit also endorsed an SADC Common Position on developing a more co-ordinated approach between regional organizations on the then multiple deployments to eastern DRC, and welcomed the organization (in late June, in Luanda) by the

        <xr pageref="N" ref="WB0231XB.IO.TXT.67">Communauté Economique des Etats de l'Afrique Centrale</xr>
         (the `Quadripartite Platform’). The regular SADC summit meeting in August endorsed the deployment of the SADC Mission in the DRC (SAMIDRC). An extraordinary meeting of the OPDS troika plus the DRC that was held in late September reiterated condemnation of the activities of the M23, the ADF, and other militant groupings, and discussed ongoing preparations for the pending deployment of the SAMIDRC. A Meeting of Chiefs of Defence of the Quadripartite was convened, against under AU auspices, in October, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. It requested the AU immediately to operationalize a Multilevel Coordination Working Group, with representation from all participating organizations, the UN, and the DRC and Rwanda. The Group was to organize a biannual meeting of quadripartite Chiefs of Defence, and a quarterly gathering of technical military experts. An extraordinary troika summit that was convened in November stated concern at continuing attacks mounted by the M23 and at the grouping’s occupation of further territory. The first contingent of SAMIDRC troops arrived in the DRC in December. An SADC SEOM monitored the general election held in the DRC in that month. In January 2024 the UN Secretary-General reported that the ADF had been significantly weakened by `Operation Shujaa’, which had been launched in late 2021 jointly by Ugandan and DRC forces.

        In February 2019 the SADC Chairperson urged the withdrawal of international sanctions still imposed on Zimbabwe. This stance was reiterated in August by SADC heads of state and of government participating in the 39th summit meeting. They noted the adverse impacts of the sanctions on the Zimbabwean economy and on the wider region, and determined that SADC member states would collectively protest the sanctions annually on 25 October, pending their withdrawal. An SADC electoral mission that was dispatched to observe a general election held in August 2023 found that, while the electoral process had been conducted relatively peacefully, provisions of the national Constitution had been overridden: 
        <i>inter alia</i>
        , the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission had failed to issue the voters’ roll uniformly on time.

               <p usage="edio ass">The assassination in early September 2017 of Lt-Gen. Khoantle Motšomotšo, the incumbent Commander of the LDF, and of two senior LDF officers, led the OPDS Chairperson immediately to send a ministerial-level fact finding mission to Lesotho. A double troika summit of SADC heads of state and government that was convened in mid-September strongly condemned the murders, and urged the Lesotho authorities to restore law and order forthwith and to accelerate investigations into both the recent atrocity and into the June 2015 assassination, by the Lesotho security forces, of the Commander of the Lesotho Defence Force (LDF), Maaparankoe Mahao. The summit also authorized the deployment of an SADC contingent force, consisting of intelligence, military, security, and civilian experts, which was tasked with providing support to the Lesotho Government by facilitating the establishment of a secure environment to support the conduct of a multi-stakeholder dialogue and the implementation of constitutional, parliamentary, judicial, security sector and public service reforms. The ministerial fact finding mission reported to the summit on the still volatile security situation in that country. The new SADC Preventive Mission in the Kingdom of Lesotho (SAPMIL) was deployed to Lesotho from early December 2017. The Executive Secretary undertook a follow-up mission to SAPMIL in February 2018. The SADC Facilitator to Lesotho helped to organize a Lesotho National Leaders Forum in August, in Maseru: this adopted the Lesotho National Leaders Forum Declaration on Comprehensive Reforms, including a commitment promptly to convene a National Dialogue aimed at advancing the ongoing political reforms process. SAPMIL was formally closed down in November. In August 2019 the 39th SADC summit welcomed the enactment of legislation in Lesotho that provided for the creation of a National Reforms Authority. In August 2022 the 42nd summit commended the ongoing efforts of the SADC Facilitator, and approved the establishment of an oversight committee for the comprehensive reforms process in Lesotho, comprising the SADC Panel of Elders and the SADC Mediation Reference Group (q.v.). A SEOM was deployed to observe legislative elections held in Lesotho in October. The Lesotho authorities’ commitment to finalizing the reforms process was welcomed by the 43rd summit, in August 2023.</p>
               <p>Against the background of an escalating political and security crisis in Eswatini, where pro-democracy demonstrations were being organized to demand political reforms to the national system of absolute monarchy, in July 2021 the Chairperson of the OPDS stated concern over numerous reported incidents of violence. He urged protesters not to attack public and private property, and called on the national security forces to exercise restraint. The OPDS Chairperson urged that grievances should be addressed through established structures, and called on the Eswatini authorities to initiate an open national dialogue to support a resolution of the crisis. An SADC fact-finding mission was dispatched briefly to Eswatini to assess the situation, and to encourage a calm national dialogue. In October the OPDS troika sent a Special Envoy to meet with the authorities in that country. The extraordinary troika summit of SADC heads of state or of government convened at the end of January 2023 condemned the recent killing of a political activist (and leading human rights lawyer) in Eswatini, Thulani Rudolf Maseko, and all other killings in that country, and called for the urgent initiation of a national dialogue process. An SADC SEOM that was dispatched to observe the general election that was held in Eswatini in late September 2023 found it to have been well organized and calm.</p>
               <p>In March 2021 the Chairperson of the OPDS condemned recent terrorist attacks (perpetrated by Ahl al-Sunna wal-Jama`a—ASWJ, associated with Islamic State Central Africa Province) that had caused numerous civilian deaths in the coastal town of Palma, Cabo Delgado, northern Mozambique, and had also prompted significant population displacement. At the beginning of April the OPDS Chairperson and President Emmerson Mnangagwa of Zimbabwe met in the Zimbabwean capital, Harare, to discuss a regional response to the worsening security situation in Cabo Delgado—where a violent insurgency had persisted since 2017; an OPDS technical deployment to Mozambique was authorized. On the basis of the OPDS report, in June 2021 SADC heads of state and government authorized the immediate deployment of an SADC Mission in Mozambique (SAMIM) to combat terrorism and violent extremism. Rwanda also committed to sending troops to work alongside the mission. The mandate of the mission was extended in October. An extraordinary summit meeting, convened in January 2022, reiterated support for SAMIM and the grouping’s commitment to securing peace in Cabo Delgado. In that year SAMIM was reformed to incorporate, as well as a military component, multidimensional civilian, police and correctional services elements. In January 2023 the OPDS Chairperson announced that SAMIM had launched an investigation into a video in circulation at that time purporting to show troops attached to the force burning the corpses of deceased terrorists. In January 2024 the UN Secretary-General reported that sustained counter-terrorism efforts by regional forces were continuing to have a significant impact on ASWJ in Cabo Delgado, and had reduced its membership to around 160-200 militants with battlefield experience. Operation Golpe Duro II, undertaken in August 2023 by SAMIM and the Mozambican security forces was reported to have killed ASWJ’s operational leader, Bonomade Machude Omar. A phased withdrawal of SAMIM from Mozambique was underway during April-July 2024.</p>

An agreement establishing the TFTA was concluded in June 2015, and was to enter into force following ratification by three-quarters of the TFTA states. On 31 July 2020 Tripartite Guidelines for the Movement of Persons, Goods and Services across the Tripartite Region during the COVID-19 Pandemic were introduced.
