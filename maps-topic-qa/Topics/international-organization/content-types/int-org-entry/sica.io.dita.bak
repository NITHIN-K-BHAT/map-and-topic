          <p>In December 1991 the heads of state of the five Central American Common Market (CACM) countries and Panama signed the Protocol of Tegucigalpa, founding the SICA regional integration process; a General Secretariat of the new grouping was inaugurated in February 1993. In September 1997 Central American heads of state and of government, meeting in the Nicaraguan capital, signed the Managua Declaration in support of further regional integration and the establishment of a political union.</p>
          <p>An Extraordinary Summit on Relaunching the Integration Process was convened in July 2010, in San Salvador, at which heads of state and of government determined to pursue greater collaboration, focusing on the following areas of activity: democratic security; the comprehensive management of disaster risk and climate change; social integration; economic integration; and strengthening regional institutions.</p>
          <p>In August 2022 SICA heads of state and of government agreed to accept Nicaragua’s candidate for Secretary-General of the grouping, following several months of disquiet and the rejection of previous candidates.</p>
          <p>A SICA General Secretariat work plan being implemented during 2022-26 had four strategic pillars: strengthening political dialogue to promote regional integration and institutional cohesion; enhancing alliances with strategic partners; implementing reforms to improve the transparency of and strengthen the General Secretariat: and supporting strategic integration initiatives. The plan had three cross-cutting axes: strengthening the internal management climate; improving strategic internal communication; and promoting digital transformation.</p>
          <p>In June 2023 SICA’s 57th summit meeting issued the Placencia Declaration, which included commitments to promoting more efficient, sustainable and resilient agrifood systems, as a means of enhancing food and nutrition security; and strengthening technical and financial collaboration with development partners and regional and international organizations.</p>

               <p>The Secretariat of Central American Social Integration—known as SISCA, and established in March 1995 in accordance with the provisions of the 1995 Treaty on Central American Social Integration (Treaty of San Salvador)—is governed by a Social Integration Council (CIS), comprising ministers or deputy ministers responsible for social affairs in each SICA member state. During 2020-40 SISCA was implementing a regional integrated social policy known as PSIR-SICA (Política Social Integral Regional del SICA). SISCA maintains a Central American Observatory for Social Development (OCADES).</p>
               <p>In February 2016 a meeting of SICA health ministers adopted a Plan of Action for the Prevention and Control of the Zika Virus in Central America and the Dominican Republic. SICA heads of state and of government agreed in December to develop a Regional Intersectoral Forum for Health of Central America and the Dominican Republic. In March 2019 SE-COMISCA (the executive secretariat of the council of SICA ministers responsible for health) issued a Declaration to Achieve an End to Tuberculosis by 2035. SE-COMISCA also organized the first meeting of a mental health technical group in that month. In February 2021 SE-COMISCA initiated a project `Efficient health systems: Roadmap for the reduction of diseases and deaths in favour of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda of the SICA Region’, with a focus on UN Sustainable Development Goal 3.4, relating to achieving by 2030 a one-third reduction in premature mortality from non-communicable diseases (NCDs). A SICA Regional Health Policy (PRSS), covering the period 2023-30, was initiated by SE-COMISCA in November 2023 (q.v.).</p>
               <p>An SE-COMISCA-(US) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention global health co-operative agreement was in force during 2020-25, focusing on: border health; response to sanitary emergencies; enteric viral diseases; infection prevention and control in health services; public health laboratory support; anti-microbial resistance; epidemiological surveillance; mycotic diseases; food and waterborne diseases; conducting a field epidemiology training programme; workforce development; and supporting national institutes of public health. A Virtual Laboratory Training on Infectious Diseases project has been developed.</p>
               <p>A Regional Contingency Plan against COVID-19 was formulated in March 2020 that had five focal areas: health and risk management (including a joint negotiation mechanism that liaises with manufacturers and distributors of medicines and strategic health sector supplies); security, justice and migration; strategic communication; international co-operation; and trade and finance (under which emergency fiscal funding was to be provided to support central and commercial banks in member states). An Observatorio Regional SICA-COVID-19, established within the framework of the Regional Contingency Plan, tracked and monitored regional data on confirmed coronavirus cases and relevant actions taken by member states.</p>

        The EU-funded PROGRESAN-SICA food and nutrition security programme aims to increase the resilience of livelihoods; to strengthen the capacity of member states to adapt to the impact of climate change, in the context of food security; and to reduce chronic and acute undernutrition in the region. It also supports regular meetings addressing the application of climate forecasts to regional nutrition security. The SICA summit meeting held in December 2022 requested the 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="SICA.IO.18">Secretaría del Consejo Agropecuario Centroamericano (CAC)</xr>
         to develop a joint mechanism for the purchase of food, fertilizers and other agricultural supplies in order to strengthen subregional food security, which was adversely affected by factors including impacts of the war in Ukraine. In June 2023 SICA and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN signed a framework co-operation agreement focused on the development of sustainable agrifood systems. Also in that month, a workshop was convened to develop an action plan to support the implementation of the Food and Nutrition Security Policy of Central America and the Dominican Republic (POLSAN), which was being implemented during 2012-32. In August 2023 PROGRESAN-SICA helped to organize a forum to address the subregional food security situation. At that time some 8.8m. people in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and the Dominican Republic were reported to be experiencing food insecurity, which was attributed to sustained high food and fuel prices, adverse weather events, crop losses, depleted resources, loss of income and loss of employment.

               <p>In June 2017 a Regional Action Plan for Rural Youth from SICA was initiated. A SICA Youth Meeting was convened in December 2019, in San Salvador. It was reported at that time that 35% of the regional population was under the age of 35. A SICA Five-Year Action Plan for the Comprehensive Prevention of Violence against Women was being implemented during 2019-23. Member states collectively pursue an agenda aimed at the economic empowerment of rural women. A Regional Policy on Gender Equality and Equity (PRIEG/SICA) was extended for 10 years by SICA leaders meeting in June 2023.</p>

               <heading>Economic Integration</heading>
               <p>In March 2002 SICA adopted the San Salvador Plan of Action for Central American Economic Integration, establishing several objectives as the basis for the future creation of a Central American customs union, with a single tariff. A roadmap was being implemented during 2015-24 towards the establishment of the union (the development of which was a regional commitment made by SICA under the Association Agreement that it concluded in 2012 with the EU).</p>
               <p>Negotiations on a free trade agreement (the United States-Central America Free Trade Agreement—CAFTA) between the CACM countries and the USA were initiated in January 2003. The Dominican Republic was subsequently integrated into the process. Under the resulting CAFTA-DR accord, which entered into force in 2006 for El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and the USA, in March 2007 for the Dominican Republic, and on 1 January 2009 for Costa Rica—some 80% of US exports of consumer and industrial goods and more than 50% of US agricultural exports to CAFTA countries were to become duty-free with immediate effect, with remaining tariffs to be eliminated over a 10-year period for consumer and industrial goods and over a 15-year period for agricultural exports.</p>
               <p>In June 2006 an agreement enabling free movement (the Convenio Centroamericano de Libre Movilidad—CA-4) was signed by El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua.</p>
               <p>The first customs union in the SIECA sub-region, between Guatemala and Honduras (which together were reported to account for 46% of GDP in Central America), entered into effect in June 2017; in August 2018 El Salvador was admitted as the third member of the so-called Northern Triangle Customs Union.</p>
               <p>Representatives of SICA and of Colombia, the Dominican Republic and Mexico adopted the Declaration of Romana in June 2006, wherein they agreed to implement the Mesoamerican Energy Integration Program, aimed at developing regional oil, electricity and natural gas markets, promoting the use of renewable energy, and increasing electricity generation and interconnection capacity across the region. In the following month, SICA member states approved the legal framework for the Central American Electrical Connection System (known as SIEPAC).</p>
               <p>In December 2008 a Treaty on Payment Systems and the Liquidation of Assets in Central America and the Dominican Republic entered into effect, envisaged as a means of developing financial markets in the region. Also in that month, an agreement to establish a Central American Statistical Commission (CENTROESTAD) was ratified, under which a regional integrated statistical information system (si-ESTAD) was developed.</p>
               <p>In June 2008—meeting within the framework of the Tuxtla Mechanism for Dialogue and Cooperation, which had been launched in 1991 as a platform for co-operation between the Central American countries and Mexico—heads of state and representatives of Belize, Costa, Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua and Panama established the Mesoamerican Integration and Development Project. (This superseded a previous Puebla-Panamá Plan that had been initiated in 2001, to promote sustainable social and economic development and integration in the region.) The new Project was to incorporate ongoing initiatives on highways and infrastructure and to implement initiatives on energy, electricity and information interconnection.</p>
               <p>In February 2019 SICA’s Regional Centre for the Promotion of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) initiated a new agenda aimed at strengthening the competitiveness of such businesses (which were then estimated to provide 3m. jobs in the region). In June 2022 the Council of Ministers of Economic Integration approved a Regional Modernization and Transformation Policy for MSMEs in the SICA countries, to cover the period 2022-50.</p>
               <p>In December 2019 the Council of Ministers adopted a Common Position of SICA Member Countries in Respect of Low Prices and Inequality in the International Marketing of Coffee. At that time SICA ministers responsible for agriculture, with their counterpart from Mexico, adopted a Comprehensive Strategy for the Positioning of Coffee in the Mesoamerican, Caribbean and Andean Region.</p>
               <p>In 2014 SICA, with other partners including the OAS and the Caribbean Tourism Organization, launched the Americas Sustainable Destinations (SDAA) initiative, with the aim of strengthening public-private partnerships to protect and to improve the lives of local people in selected destination areas. The inaugural regional forum on tourism investment was convened in June 2017, in San José (Costa Rica). In September 2020 the SICA Secretary-General participated in a regional dialogue aimed at sustainably redeveloping the tourism sector in the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
               <p>The SICA Digital Regional Strategy (known by its Spanish acronym, ERDI) was introduced in 2015 to advance the regional integration process through the promotion of the use of digital technologies. Strategic alliances are pursued with the EU and the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration to benefit from geospatial platforms.</p>
               <p>In 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Biosecurity Guidelines for the Transportation of Land Cargo were developed. The sectors most affected in the SICA region by the pandemic crisis were reported to be commerce, transportation, hospitality, construction, textiles, manufacturing, and finance. In 2021 28.9% of total exports from SICA member states were destined for the intraregional market, and 71.1% for global markets. In November 2022 a (virtual) intersectoral ministerial meeting uniting COMIECO (ministers from SICA member states with responsibility for economic affairs), COMITRAN (transport) and COMISCA (health) approved a Regional Economic Reactivation Plan; this was published in March 2023.</p>

               <p>In December 2007, with a view to combating transnational organized crime in the region, SICA heads of state and of government adopted the Estrategia de Seguridad de Centro­américa (ESCA: the Central American Security Strategy)—with four components: Combating crime; Violence prevention; Rehabilitation, reintegration and penitentiary security; and Institutional strengthening. A Mechanism for Coordinating, Evaluating and Monitoring Projects of ESCA was initiated in November 2011. The heads of state and of government of the SICA countries and Mexico determined in February 2013 to establish a specialized secretariat to focus on regional security issues. A SICA Strategic Framework for Violence Prevention was initiated in May 2014.</p>
               <p>During the period 2019-23, within the ESCA framework, SICA implementied an EU- and AECID-funded ICRIME project, which aimed to enhance the effectiveness of criminal justice mechanisms and to strengthen criminal investigations against networks responsible for international organized crime and drug trafficking.</p>
               <p>SICA has worked to develop a framework for migration governance; labour migration; protection and consular assistance for migrants; socioeconomic development and integration; extra-regional migration; and combating human trafficking and smuggling. From 2018 the phenomenon emerged of large so-called `migrant caravans’ headed from the Northern Triangle countries towards the Mexico-USA border. In May SICA pledged commitment to a strategic Comprehensive Regional Protection and Solutions Framework (known as `MIRPS’), which was initiated in 2017 to strengthen co-ordination on issues concerning the protection of forcibly displaced persons, enhancing national legal frameworks and disseminating international refugee legislation. In October 2018 a pilot project was initiated within the MIRPS framework, in Ocotepeque, Honduras, positioned close to the El Salvador and Guatemala borders. The initiative aimed to strengthen border security and people-focused co-operation between institutions including municipal authorities, police forces, customs officials and the judiciary, and focused on the identification, profiling and support of displaced people with protection needs.</p>
