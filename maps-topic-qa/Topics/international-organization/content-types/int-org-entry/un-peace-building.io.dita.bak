                    <p usage="ewyb edio mena">In December 2015 the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2254, which endorsed a roadmap for peace in Syria (which had been engulfed since 2012 in civil conflict), and called for a formal UN-facilitated, Syrian-led political process—to be organized by the UN Special Envoy—and the establishment of a `credible, inclusive and non-sectarian’ governance structure. The UN Special Envoy is authorized to provide good offices aimed at bringing an end to all violence and human rights violations, and promoting a peaceful solution to the Syrian crisis.</p>

                    <p usage="ewyb edio mena">In November 2015 representatives of the UN, the Arab League, the European Union, and ministers responsible for foreign affairs of the USA, Russian Federation (which in September had decided to intervene militarily in Syria, in support of the al-Assad regime), and 15 other states—meeting in Vienna, Austria, as the `International Syria Support Group’ (ISSG)—determined that political talks between the Syrian Government and opposition factions should commence in early 2016, with a view to expediting an end to the Syrian conflict and to accelerating agreement on a new Syrian constitution, governance structure and elections schedule. The ISSG established a Humanitarian Task Force (HTF), which has met regularly in Geneva, Switzerland, under the chairmanship of the Office of the Special Envoy for Syria. The Group also formed a Ceasefire Task Force (CTF), for which the Office provides secretariat services. The ISSG-sponsored peace talks (referred to as `Geneva III’) commenced at the beginning of February 2016, but were suspended shortly afterwards, reportedly owing to opposition concern over mounting air attacks on rebel areas by Russian and Syrian government forces. The Geneva III series of negotiations was reconvened in March, at which time the UN Special Envoy released a statement of shared goals and principles; a further session of the talks was convened in April, at which timethe Special Envoy reported that the humanitarian situation in Syria had deteriorated severely during that month. By September some 250,000 people were reported to be under siege in eastern Aleppo as Russian and Syrian government forces attempted to recapture the city from militants. In that month the Special Envoy condemned the destruction in an air strike of part of a convoy of trucks near Aleppo that had been transporting humanitarian aid to civilians. Following a resumption in mid-November of intense air strikes against eastern Aleppo, by December most of the area was under the control of Syrian government forces. In December the Security Council adopted a resolution that expressed alarm at the `continued deterioration of the devastating humanitarian situation in Aleppo’, and requested the UN and other relevant agencies to monitor evacuations of civilians from the city.</p>
                    <p>In January 2017 the UN Security Council expressed alarm at reports of the destruction of cultural heritage in Palmyra, Syria, and of executions by Islamic State being conducted in the theatre there. Two further rounds of ISSG negotiations (referred to as Geneva IV and V) were held during February-March, in Geneva. In early April the Security Council convened to discuss an alleged recent sarin gas attack against the rebel-occupied northwestern Syrian settlement of Khan Sheikhoun that was estimated to have killed nearly 90 people, and was reportedly perpetrated by the Syrian military. Further rounds of ISSG-sponsored negotiations (Geneva VI, VII, VIII and IX) were held in mid-May, July, December and in January 2018. At the end of January 2018 the UN Special Envoy attended a peace conference for Syria organized in Sochi, Russia, by Russian President Vladimir Putin. The conference issued the Sochi Final Statement, in which it determined that a new committee—comprising diverse Syrian stakeholders—would be tasked, under UN auspices, with drafting a new Syrian Constitution.</p>
                    <p>A significant military escalation throughout Syria and at its borders occurred in early 2018. In February the UN Secretary-General urged an immediate unconditional de-escalation of tensions, following targeted air strikes by Israel against alleged Iranian positions inside Syria—apparently mandated in retaliation for an Iranian drone launch into Israeli territory from Syria, as well as for the destruction by the Syrian military of an Israeli fighter jet. Later in that month, after a protracted debate, and against a backdrop of intensive warfare and numerous civilian casualties in the rebel-held eastern Ghouta area, which was under bombardment by Syrian government forces, the Security Council approved a resolution that demanded a 30-day ceasefire in Syria in order to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid as well as to enable medical and other civilian evacuations. Some Islamist groupings, however, were not covered by the UN truce, and it was not fully upheld by the Syrian Government.</p>
                    <p>In April 2018 the USA, France and the UK conducted air strikes against suspected chemical weapons manufacturing facilities and capabilities in Syria, undertaken, without a UN Security Council mandate, in response to recent chemical attacks allegedly perpetrated by the Syrian regime against civilian sites. The UN Secretary-General subsequently emphasized UN member states’ obligation to act in matters of peace and security in accordance with the UN Charter and urged the Security Council to unite over demanding accountability for the use of chemical weapons in Syria. The Special Envoy participated as an observer in a meeting held by Iran, Russia and Turkey in mid-May, in Astana, Kazakhstan, with attendance by the Syrian Government and by representatives of armed militia active in Syria. In June, ahead of further talks on the implementation of the Sochi Final Statement, the UN Envoy reiterated that the process of drafting the proposed new Syrian Constitution should be inclusive, and thus should comprise independent delegates, experts, and representatives of civil society, and should have at least 30% female participation. By July the Syrian armed forces had regained nearly all territory in southern areas of the country. At the end of August the UN Secretary-General appealed urgently to all parties to exercise military restraint and to prioritize the protection of civilians in the northwestern rebel-dominated Idlib area, and urged the leaders of the ongoing Astana negotiations process (the `Astana guarantors’) to intensify efforts to resolve peacefully the situation in Idlib. In early September the UN Security Council met both formally and informally to address the political and humanitarian dimensions of the situation in Idlib. The UN Secretary-General welcomed the conclusion by Russia and Turkey later in that month of a formal Memorandum on Stabilization of the Situation in the Idlib De-escalation Area, which included the establishment, from mid-October, of a 15&#160;km-25 km demilitarized buffer zone.</p>
                    <p>In September 2019 the UN Secretary-General announced that agreement had been reached on the composition of the proposed Constitutional Committee, to comprise equal representation of Syrian President Assad’s Government, civil society and opposition delegates (grouped as the Syrian Negotiations Commission). The inaugural meeting of the new Constitutional Committee was convened on 30 October. In March 2020 Russia and Turkey agreed a ceasefire and concluded an Additional Protocol to the 2018 Memorandum on Stabilization of the Situation in the Idlib De-escalation Area, which provided for the creation of a jointly patrolled security corridor. In July 2020, in an address to the UN Security Council, the Special Envoy appealed to all Syrian parties to release conflict-related detainees and abductees.</p>
                    <p>In January 2021 the so-called `Small Body’ of the Constitutional Committee, comprising 45 delegates, met for its fifth session, facilitated by the UN Special Envoy. The Special Envoy subsequently criticized the lack of progress made—notably, while the Syrian regime favoured amending the existing national Constitution, opposition delegates were demanding a new one—and emphasized that there would need to be willingness to compromise in order to further the peace process. Following a trilateral meeting on the sidelines of the Constitutional Committee’s session, Iran, Russia and Turkey issued a joint statement, in which they reaffirmed their readiness to support the Committee's work, by means of continuous interaction with the Syrian stakeholders and with the Special Envoy. They also urged a spirit of compromise and constructive engagement. Addressing the Security Council in late May, the Special Envoy noted that an ongoing presidential election in Syria was not being conducted within the framework of Resolution 2254 (which provided for UN-administered inclusive elections to follow the adoption of a new Constitution). At that time he stated concern that, without active efforts by each side to advance the implementation of Resolution 2254, the Syrian conflict might become protracted down generations. In mid-June the Special Envoy condemned the shelling of the al-Shifaa Hospital in Afrin, northern Syria. At the end of July the Special Envoy called for the de-escalation of an upsurge of violent conflict in southwestern Syria. In mid-August he reiterated concern over the deteriorating situation in southern areas of the country, which was causing civilian casualties and displacement, damage to infrastructure, and shortages of critical supplies, including of medicines and fuel. Hostilities and massive displacement continued into early 2022 in northwestern Syria: in January Russian shelling and air strikes intensified against civilian infrastructure and settlements in and around the rebel-occupied Idlib De-escalation Area. In early February a US special operation in Idlib led to the death of the Islamic State leader Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi, as well as reportedly also causing, collaterally, 13 civilian fatalities. Continuing Israeli air strikes against Syrian military and Iran-associated militia targets were also reported. The Special Envoy supported the eighth round of Small Body constitutional negotiations in June, in Geneva; the planned ninth instalment, initially scheduled to have been held in July, was postponed, reportedly in view of an objection by Russia to Geneva as the continuing location of the talks.</p>
                    <p>Following the earthquakes that devastated parts of Syria and Türkiye (as Turkey was now known) in February 2023 the ISSG’s HTF met to identify local humanitarian needs in Syria, where up to 8.8m. survivors were thought to require urgent assistance. The temporary opening of additional border crossings to facilitate the ongoing massive relief effort was welcomed. Donors were urged to support a UN flash appeal for US&#8201;$398m. In March the Special Envoy noted that the momentum of the ongoing constructive humanitarian co-operation should be translated also to the political process. In early April high-level talks were convened between Syria, Russia, Iran and Türkiye, in Moscow, Russia, under a Russian initiative focused on improving relations between the Syrian administration and Türkiye. Addressing the Seventh Conference on Supporting the Future of Syria and the Region (`Brussels VII’), chaired by the EU in Belgium in that month, the Special Envoy took note of the recent tragic earthquakes and related constructive humanitarian co-operation, that had been followed by new diplomatic overtures between Arab states and the Syrian Government (in May Syria had been readmitted to the Arab League). He urged the development of confidence measures and the renewal of the intra-Syrian political process, with co-ordinated co-operation by all stakeholders. He reiterated that no single group of players would be able to dictate the outcome of the conflict and welcomed calls to reconvene the stalled Constitutional Committee meetings process. The membership of the Syrian Women’s Advisory Board was renewed during 2023-24.</p>
                    <p>The Special Envoy continued in 2024 to maintain communication with Syrian civil society and women’s representatives, and with regional and international stakeholders. Invitations to the long-delayed ninth round of Small Body constitutional negotiations (scheduled to be held at the end of April—in Geneva, despite Russia’s objections) were issued by the Special Envoy in February. In March, marking the 13th anniversary of the violent suppression of mass protests in Syria that had triggered the protracted conflict, the Special Envoy appealed to all parties to commit to pursuing a comprehensive nationwide ceasefire. At the beginning of April, urging utmost restraint by all the parties, he condemned an attack (reportedly by Israeli security forces) against Iran’s diplomatic mission in Damascus, in which two Iranian military commanders and five military advisers, and also seven Syrians were killed.</p>

                    <p>In February 2015 the Shi`a Houthi (Ansar Allah) secessionist rebel grouping, based in northern Yemen, announced that a transitional five-member presidential council would take over from the legitimately elected Yemeni President. The UN Security Council, by means of Resolution 2201, deplored the dissolution of parliament and overthrow of government institutions, demanded that the Houthi militants `immediately and unconditionally' cede power and urged the pursuit of a consensus solution to the Yemeni political crisis. By late March the then Special Adviser to the UN Secretary-General warned that the country was on the brink of civil war, with violence on both sides escalating. A Special Envoy for Yemen was appointed by the Secretary-General in April, with a mandate to co-operate closely with the UN Security Council, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC—in support of its ongoing peace initiative for Yemen), the parties to the ongoing conflict in that country, and other stakeholders.</p>

                    <heading>Activities</heading>
                    <p>In July 2015 the worsening security situation in Yemen was declared a UN system-wide `Level 3’ (severe) humanitarian emergency. In September Yemeni President Abd al-Rabbuh Mansur Hadi returned to Aden (taken over earlier in the year by the Houthi secessionist grouping), following its recapture by Saudi-backed government forces. In October the UN Special Envoy and head of the sanctions committee on Yemen informed the Security Council that both sides to the conflict had agreed to engage in direct negotiations; talks between representatives of the Yemeni Government and a delegation comprising Houthi and other opposition representatives were initiated in late 2015, and resumed thereafter intermittently, with ongoing mediation by the Special Envoy. A ceasefire agreement was concluded in that month, but was subsequently frequently broken. In May 2016 a Djibouti-based UN Verification and Inspection Mechanism was inaugurated to facilitate the unbroken transportation of commercial goods and services, and humanitarian assistance, to Yemen, while simultaneously ensuring compliance with the ongoing sanctions regime. A gathering in November 2017 of the so-called `Quint’ on Yemen (comprising the foreign ministers of Oman, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates—UAE, the UK and the USA) condemned a recent Houthi missile attack on a civilian area of Riyadh, and urged the Houthis and their allies to engage with the UN Special Envoy (the Houthis had suspended their co-operation, accusing the Envoy of bias against them). Addressing the UN Security Council in early December, the Special Envoy reported on the recent assassination of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh and leaders of Saleh’s General People's Congress, and on an intense escalation of the conflict, noting the devastating impact of the heightened conflict on civilians. In mid-December the Special Envoy condemned a further Houthi missile launch against Riyadh.</p>
                    <p>In February 2018 a newly-appointed Special Envoy, Martin Griffiths, declared that he would prioritize facilitating an inclusive political process based on the GCC initiative and on the outcome document (agreed in January 2014) of a National Dialogue process on Yemen’s future, and stressed that achieving this would require significant compromises from all parties to the conflict. In mid-2018 the Special Envoy attempted without success to negotiate an agreement to secure the Houthis’ withdrawal from the Red Sea port of Hodeidah (Hudaydah; through which around 70% of Yemen’s imports of food, medical supplies and fuel passed), with a view to deterring military action in that area by the Saudi-led coalition (which alleged that the Houthis were smuggling weapons through the port) and to facilitating operations by humanitarian agencies. (The UN Verification and Inspection Mechanism, however, had not hitherto reported the discovery of weaponry on ships screened at Hodeidah and no such discoveries had been reported to the UN’s sanctions committee on Yemen. The UN Panel of Experts on Yemen, which supports the sanctions committee, noted that the Houthis had usurped control of national arms stockpiles in 2014, and that external arms supplies were likely to be transported by land.) In August 2018 the Special Envoy called for the organization of Intra-Yemeni consultations to prompt a resumption of the political process (by then suspended for two years). The Intra-Yemeni consultations, held in Geneva in early September, were deemed formally to have relaunched the process, although there was no participation by Houthi representatives. In early November the Special Envoy held a consultative meeting with a number of independent representatives of Yemeni society, and shortly afterwards he met with civil society workers and tribal leaders, and with international and local stakeholders engaged with informal so-called `Track II’ peacemaking initiatives. In mid-November the Special Envoy chaired a meeting of a Yemeni women’s technical advisory group, which had been established by his Office to incorporate women’s perspectives into his overall strategy. In early December, for the first time in two years, representatives of the Yemeni Government and the Houthi militia held talks—mediated by the Special Envoy, in Stockholm, Sweden. These culminated, in mid-December, in the conclusion of the Stockholm Accords, comprising the Agreement on the City of Hodeidah and Ports of Hodeidah, Salif, and Ras Isa—providing for an immediate ceasefire arrangement and for the phased redeployment of armed forces away from that area; for an executive mechanism to facilitate the exchange of prisoners; and a statement regarding the fiercely contested city of Taïz. (No agreement was then reached, however, on reopening the international airport at Sana’a or on reunifying the Central Bank of Yemen, divided into two entities in September 2016.) A Redeployment Coordination Commission was to supervise the ceasefire and the redeployment of forces, and also to oversee mine action operations. The Special Envoy subsequently liaised with both sides on progress achieved in implementing the agreements. A Supervisory Committee overseeing implementation of the prisoner exchange accord convened from January 2019. In January the UN Security Council established the UN Mission in Support of the Hudaydah Agreement (q.v.).</p>
                    <p>
          In mid-February 2019 the Yemeni Government and Houthi rebels, under the auspices of the Chairman of the Redeployment Coordination Commission, reached agreement on the first phase of the redeployment of their forces from Hodeidah, Salif and Ras Isa ports and from areas around humanitarian facilities in Hodeidah. At that time they also agreed in principle the second phase of the troop withdrawal. In February the Special Envoy urged combatants to permit humanitarian access to World Food Programme (WFP) grain stores held in the Red Sea Mills facility at Hodeidah. (WFP reported subsequently, however, that its operations in Yemen continued to be severely impeded.) A Peace Support Facility—managed by the OSESGY, UNDP and the UN Resident Coordinator’s Office in Yemen—was launched in April. An initial redeployment of Houthi forces from Hodeidah, Salif and Ras Isa—monitored by UNMHA—was implemented from 11-14 May. The Special Envoy continued to engage with Yemeni stakeholders, although the resumption of formal Intra-Yemeni consultations stalled. In July the Special Envoy observed that implementation of the Stockholm Accords was slow. At that time he welcomed a decision by the Saudi-led Coalition to redeploy forces outside Yemen. In early August forces affiliated with the UAE-supported separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC) took control of military camps and state institutions in Aden and nearby Abyan, causing numerous civilian casualties. Saudi Arabia undertook air strikes against the STC, which, in turn, prompted fighting between the STC and forces loyal to (Saudi-backed) President Hadi. Meanwhile, Hadi urged the UAE’s removal from the Saudi-led military coalition. The Special Envoy condemned the STC’s actions and deplored the related harassment and attacks against Yemeni civilians of northern origin. He also condemned continuing Houthi attacks against Saudi civilian infrastructure. During August, despite their divergent policies on Yemen, Saudi Arabia and the UAE agreed to establish a joint committee with the aim of stabilizing the situation in Yemen, and invited participation by the internationally recognized Yemeni Government and the STC in a new Jeddah Dialogue initiative. In mid-September the Special Envoy stated deep concern over Houthi drone attacks that struck two major oil facilities in Saudi Arabia causing significant temporary disruption to production. He called on all parties to exercise restraint and to avoid any further military escalation. In late September the UN Security Council welcomed a proposal by the OSESGY to establish an advisory group to prepare for the resumption of formal consultations. On 5 November the Jeddah Dialogue culminated in the signature of the Riyadh Agreement, with provisions covering security, military and political issues. These included,

           the establishment of a national unity government to represent, on an equal basis, southern and northern Yemen, with the STC to be allocated two ministerial positions, and ministerial representation to be given also to other southern Yemeni groupings. The accord also provided for the national Government to return to Aden without obstructions. In early February 2020 the Special Envoy welcomed the establishment of a medical air bridge operation conducted by the World Health Organization to transport groups of Yemeni patients to secure medical treatment in Amman, Jordan. Later in that month he condemned a prolonged escalation since January of air strikes and ground attacks in northern Yemen, and called for an immediate freeze on all military activity there. In early April the Special Envoy liaised with the parties to the conflict to reach agreement on implementing a national ceasefire, in view of the COVID-19 emergency. The Saudi-led coalition declared a two-week ceasefire on 8 April; a nationwide cessation of hostilities was not, however, forthcoming.
        </p>
                    <p>In June 2020 Saudi Arabia initiated a mechanism to accelerate the implementation of security dimensions of the November 2019 Riyadh Agreement. During June 2020 the OSESGY concluded an online mass consultation on the future of Yemen. At that time the Special Envoy denounced an ongoing military escalation, including intensifying conflict in the Ma’rib and Al-Jawf governorates, where Houthi forces were maintaining a relentless offensive. In late August the Special Envoy, who was working to facilitate the continued flow of commercial fuel imports into Yemen via Hodeidah, stated deep concern at major fuel shortages in Houthi-controlled areas, and called on all parties to work with the Office to resolve the situation. The Special Envoy participated in a high-level ministerial conference on Yemen in mid-September, which released a joint communiqué that addressed the urgent need for military de-escalation. He welcomed a decision reached late in that month by the Yemeni Government and Houthis to free an initial group of conflict-related detainees, representing progress towards fulfilling the 2018 Stockholm commitment to releasing prisoners. (In total 1,056 detainees were freed in October.) The UN Security Council condemned a Houthi attack that was perpetrated in late November against Saudi Arabian oil facilities in Jeddah.</p>
                    <p>The OSESGY welcomed the installation on 18 December 2020, in accordance with the provisions of the Riyadh Agreement, of a new power-sharing `unity’ Government—with Dr Maeen Abdulmalik Saeed as Prime Minister, and 24 ministerial portfolios divided between the north and the south. He observed that more progress was required on incorporating Yemeni women into the top tiers of government. At the end of December the OSESGY condemned an attack against the airport in Aden that had been timed for the arrival (collectively in one plane) of the new Cabinet, and had caused at least 28 civilian fatalities and many injuries. (The new Cabinet was unharmed.) A subsequent Yemeni Government investigation held the Houthis responsible for the atrocity. In early January 2021 the Special Envoy held discussions with President Hadi, in Riyadh, and then visited the new Yemeni Cabinet in Aden. At that time, as part of an ongoing campaign to exert `maximum pressure’ against Iran, the outgoing US Administration of President Trump designated Ansar Allah&#160;(the Houthis) as a foreign terrorist organization. The decision was welcomed by the Yemeni Government. The Special Envoy warned, however, that the designation might further complicate the process of bringing together the opposing sides in the Yemeni conflict. The incoming Biden Administration subsequently reversed the decision. (In February 2022 Ansar Allah was designated as a terrorist group by the UN Security Council.)</p>
                    <p>In March 2021, addressing the UN Security Council, the Special Envoy stated that the civil war was once again in `full force’. He reported on the extreme risk to around 1m. displaced people and other civilians caused by the continuing Houthi offensive against Ma’rib, and also stated concern over military escalations in Hajjah (in northeastern Yemen) and Taïz, persistent violence in Hodeidah, and a recent increase in strikes by missiles and drones, including against Saudi Arabian civilian and commercial infrastructure. The Security Council subsequently adopted a resolution that emphasized the need for a comprehensive military de-escalation, including an immediate end to the Houthi offensive on Ma’rib, and to the use of child soldiers there. The Council also noted with concern that the lack of progress in the peace process might be exploited by terrorist groupings. In mid-April the Council welcomed a Yemeni Government-supported announcement by Saudi Arabia, made on 22 March, that it would work to achieve a comprehensive political solution to the conflict. All parties were urged to engage constructively with the OSESGY, and to negotiate a nationwide ceasefire. Meanwhile, the Special Envoy conducted a series of meetings with stakeholders aimed at bringing about a ceasefire. In mid-May, however, he reported to the Security Council that the Houthi military escalation against Ma’rib was continuing relentlessly, that restrictions on imports through Hodeidah were causing price increases and severe fuel shortages, that the airport at Sana’a was closed and movements restricted, and that the political process was fully stalled. In the following month the Special Envoy informed the Security Council that the Houthis were insisting on the conclusion of separate discrete agreements regarding Hodeidah and Sana’a airport before negotiating a ceasefire—i.e. would not agree to the four-point plan in its entirety as a package accord, as was being advocated for by the Yemeni Government. A new Special Envoy, Hans Grundberg, assumed the role in early September. In mid-September Grundberg visited Riyadh, to hold discussions with Yemeni President Hadi and members of his government, as well as with senior Saudi officials; in October, visiting Aden, he held discussions with the Yemeni Prime Minister and the Chairman of the STC. In mid-October the UN Security Council condemned recent Houthi attacks against Saudi airports, and deepening maritime insecurity in the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea off the Yemeni coast. In mid-November the Houthi forces took control of a significant area of Hodeidah.</p>
                    <p>In mid-December 2021 the Special Envoy, addressing the Security Council, stated deep alarm at a considerable escalation of the conflict, and reiterated calls for restraint and dialogue. At the end of the month he again urged a de-escalation, noting that recent Saudi-led coalition air strikes against Sana’a had caused civilian deaths and had damaged civilian residential areas and infrastructure, while the ongoing Houthi offensive against Ma’rib was also causing fatalities, damage, and prompting mass displacement. In mid-January 2022 (for the first time since 2018) the Houthis conducted missile and drone attacks—denounced as `heinous’ by the UN Security Council—against civilian targets in the UAE, including against the international airport serving its capital, Abu Dhabi, and oil installations. The UN Secretary-General deplored air strikes by the Saudi-led coalition in that month against a detention centre in Yemen’s Sa`da Governorate, that resulted in the deaths of 91 inmates.&#160;In mid-February, reporting to the Security Council, Grundberg emphasized that the war was also being fought on economic fronts, including over trade flows and resources. At that time the Council strongly condemned the ongoing military escalation, including cross-border `terrorist’ assaults and attacks on civilian targets by the Houthis, and reiterated the need for full implementation of the 2019 Riyadh Agreement.</p>
                    <p>In early March 2022 the Special Envoy met with Yemeni President Hadi, as part of a new OSESGY initiative to advance structured bilateral consultations with multiple stakeholders (including women, youth, and other representatives of broad civil society), with a view to developing a multi-track framework for ending the conflict. Urgent requirements and long-term priorities were to be identified along three parallel tracks: security, political and economic. During late March-early April the GCC hosted UN-mediated Yemeni-Yemeni consultations on the conflict, in Riyadh (the Saudi-led coalition called a ceasefire just prior to the talks); on 1 April the UN Special Envoy announced that an initially two-month, potentially renewable, nationwide truce—the first since 2016—had been agreed, to start on 2 April 2022: the first day of the religious holy month of Ramadan. Under the terms of the truce, military offensives and cross-border attacks were to be suspended, fuel vessels were to be permitted access to Houthi-held Hodeidah, and restrictions on roads and commercial flights lifted. The UN Secretary-General urged all stakeholders promptly to implement the agreement. It was reported at that time that since 2016 nearly 400,000 people had been killed by impacts of the conflict, including lack of safe water and healthcare, and starvation.</p>
                    <p>In mid-April 2022 the Special Envoy reported to the UN Security Council that thus far the truce was largely being respected, and that the OSESGY had created co-ordination mechanisms to support it, and was liaising between the parties with a view to reopening roads to Taïz and other governorates. The OSESGY initiated a Military Coordination Committee in May, with participation by military representatives of the Yemeni Government, Houthis and Coalition Joint Forces Command. On 2 June Grundberg announced that the parties to the conflict had agreed to extend the truce by two months. In-person meetings between the parties to the conflict, organized under UN auspices, had restarted. In early July the OSESGY issued an updated proposal on phased road reopening (with an initial focus on four roads in Taïz). In mid-July the Special Envoy reported to the UN Security Council that, while the truce was holding, allegations were continuing of military reconnaissance overflights, direct and indirect firing, drone attacks, trench and fortification construction, and of the reinforcement of principal front lines (including at Hodeidah, Ma’rib and Taïz). The OSESGY was supporting the implementation of communication channels to address such challenges. The Special Envoy stated deep concern over the need to secure adequate funding for UNVIM’s activities (that included facilitating the passage of commercial fuel ships into Hodeidah). Shortly afterwards the OSESGY reported a significant decrease in civilian casualties and displacement since the start of the truce. However, in that month the Special Envoy condemned an attack against a residential neighbourhood in Taïz; a further attack on Taïz in August was also condemned.</p>
                    <p>
          On 2 August 2022 the UN-mediated truce in place since 2 April was extended for a further two months, until 2 October. Meanwhile, the Special Envoy pursued discussions aimed at achieving an expanded truce, that would provide, 
          <i>inter alia,</i>
           for an effective disbursement mechanism that would enable the regular issuance of civilian pensions and of civil servant salaries; the successful opening of roads in Taïz and elsewhere; and the addition of more routes to and from Sana’a International Airport; and that would ultimately set a path towards securing a negotiated resolution of the conflict. A fourth extension of the truce was not, however, achieved by the deadline of 2 October; in mid-October, addressing the Security Council, the Special Envoy attributed this to additional demands that had been submitted by the Houthis. He urged all parties to continue to exercise maximum restraint. In late November the Special Envoy reported that, while there had been no major military escalation since the end of the truce, the Houthis had recently conducted attacks against oil terminals and ports in Hadramawt and Shabwa, with the objective of depriving the Government of its principal source of export revenue. In January 2023 the Special Envoy reported that overall the military situation continued to be stable, although limited military activity was occurring along frontlines, in particular in Ma’rib, Dali, Taïz, Hodeidah, and Lahj governorates, and in the Yemen-Saudi Arabia border area. A UN-supported High-level Pledging Event on the Humanitarian Crisis in Yemen, held in February, in Geneva, raised US&#8201;$1,160m. In March discussions mediated by the Special Envoy and by the International Committee of the Red Cross culminated in an agreement on an implementation plan that provided for the release (effected in mid-April) of 887 conflict-related detainees. On 2 April, marking the first anniversary of the commencement of the 2022 formal truce, the Special Envoy reported that elements of the truce were still largely holding, but that the gains achieved needed to be anchored in political progress towards a comprehensive peaceful resolution of the conflict, and were put at risk by a recent escalation in military activity and divisive rhetoric. He emphasized the interconnectivity of the three parallel tracks of the Office’s work programme—security (managed through the Military Coordination Committee), political (through continuous engagement with national actors and regional and international stakeholders), and economic (engagement with relevant experts, civil society representatives, the Yemeni private sector, and international financial institutions). By that time fuel and other commodities were continuing to enter Hodeidah, and commercial flights were operating three times a week between Sana’a and Amman. In mid-April the Special Envoy noted with concern recent military activity in Ma’rib, Shabwa, Taïz and other governorates, and reiterated calls to the conflicting parties to exercise maximum restraint. Reporting to the Security Council in July, he noted that, after a seven-year hiatus, commercial flights had resumed between Sana’a and Saudi Arabia. Broad consultations aimed at engaging diverse Yemeni stakeholders were convened in the second half of 2023. In late December the Special Envoy welcomed commitment by the parties to a series of measures aimed at underpinning a nationwide ceasefire, ameliorating living conditions for the Yemeni population, and advancing progress towards the resumption of a UN-mediated inclusive political process. A roadmap was to be developed, under UN auspices, that would enshrine these measures and provide a framework for their implementation.
        </p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, however, regional insecurity deteriorated markedly from October 2023 (in view of repercussions of the Hamas-Israel conflict). In mid-January 2024, in response to an escalation of Houthi attacks targeting Israel-bound oil tankers and other Israeli-affiliated vessels in Red Sea shipping lanes (on 9 January an unprecedentedly massive barrage of missiles and drones had been fired by the Houthis) the United Kingdom and USA launched retaliatory air strikes against various Houthi sites in Yemen. The Special Envoy urged all parties to exercise maximum restraint and to avoid actions that might worsen the situation in Yemen, escalate the risk to maritime trade routes, or further provoke regional tensions. The UN Security Council adopted a resolution in that month that demanded the immediate cessation by the Houthis of attacks against merchant and commercial vessels. Briefing the Council in February, the Special Envoy observed that the Yemeni peace process could not be insulated from the military escalation in the Red Sea or from other regional tensions linked to the war in Gaza—thus complicating the mediation landscape. Furthermore, within Yemen (which was beset by `staggering’ economic challenges), force mobilizations, clashes and casualties were reported to be mounting, including in Al Jawf, Ma’rib, Saadah, Shabwa and Taïz. In that month the USA reclassified the Houthis as a terrorist grouping. </p>

                    <p>On 16 January 2019 UN Security Council Resolution 2452 established UNMHA to support the implementation of a ceasefire accord concluded in the previous month, in Stockholm, Sweden, between the Yemeni Government and Houthi rebel grouping, with respect to Hodeidah (Hudaydah, city and Red Sea port), and also the Red Sea ports of Salif and Ras Isa. UNMHA was tasked with leading and supporting a Redeployment Coordination Commission that was mandated to supervise the ceasefire and the redeployment of forces, as well as mine action operations. The mission was to monitor compliance with the ceasefire, to ensure that security was guaranteed by local security forces (in accordance with Yemeni law), and to co-ordinate UN efforts to support stakeholders in fully implementing the Agreement. The Head of Mission was to report to the UN Secretary-General through the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen and also through the Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs. The mission had an authorized strength of 75 observers.</p>

                    <p>During early 2019 the mission worked to negotiate a redeployment of forces between the two sides. In May the mission monitored the withdrawal of Houthi forces from the three main port areas and the transfer of responsibility for port security to the national coast guard. It subsequently continued actively to verify the sustained demilitarization of the port area, and to follow up matters related to explosive remnants of war and military activities. In September a joint operations centre was established at the mission to embed Houthi and Yemeni military officers with UNMHA personnel, as a confidence-building measure. Under the UN-mediated truce that entered into effect on 1 April 2022 fuel ships were permitted access to Hodeidah port; UNMHA was able to strengthen routine patrols of Hodeidah, Salif and Ras Isa, and verify damage caused to Hodeidah by the conflict. The Head of Mission conducted regional visits to Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the UAE in February and September 2022, to discuss means of advancing the implementation of UNMHA’s mandate. The mission recorded 289 incidents in Hodeidah in 2022 of civilian deaths or injuries caused by landmines or explosive remnants of war, and has placed a focus on intensifying its mine clearance activities. In July 2023 the UN Security Council extended UNMHA’s mandate until 14 July 2024.</p>

          UNOWAS was established in January 2016 through a merger of the former UN Office for West Africa (UNOWA, established in 2002) and the Office of the Special Envoy for the Sahel, to provide preventive diplomacy, good offices, and political mediation and facilitation efforts in the combined region. UNOWAS is also mandated to support the implementation of the October 2002 ruling of the

The 38th such meeting, convened in September 2023, in Dakar, Senegal, stated concern over recent multiple unconstitutional changes of governments in the region, emphasizing the need promptly to restore constitutional order. A UNOWAS-UN Office for Central Africa co-ordination meeting is held annually. In March 2022 the Deputy SRSG chaired the inaugural annual Women's Forum for Peace and Security in West Africa and the Sahel, organized under UNOWAS-ECOWAS auspices in Nouakchott, Mauritania.

                    <p>UNOWAS supports the implementation of the Code of Conduct concerning the Prevention and Repression of Piracy, Armed Robbery against Ships, and Illegal Maritime Activities in West and Central Africa, which was opened for signature at a regional summit held in Yaoundé, Cameroon, in June 2013 (and is thus referred to as the Yaoundé Code of Conduct).</p>
                    <p>Addressing the root causes of the presence of Boko Haram in the Lake Chad Basin was a focus of UN Security Council Resolution 2347, adopted in March 2017. UNOWAS supported the development of the Regional Stabilization, Recovery and Resilience Strategy for Areas Affected by Boko Haram in the Lake Chad Basin, which was adopted in August 2018 by an AU-LCBC ministerial conference. In August 2020 UNOWAS and UNOCA were designated as co-leaders of the governance cluster of the regional task force guiding the implementation of the Strategy. In January 2024 the UN Secretary-General reported that the scale of Islamic State violence was greater in West Africa and the Sahel than in other parts of Africa, with Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) remaining the most active affiliate in the region. However, an increase in military offensives by regional and national forces, as well as ISWAP-Boko Haram clashes were reported to have contributed to an overall decline in terrorist attacks. Both ISWAP and Boko Haram were reported to be struggling to raise sufficient funds to pay their recruits and thus unable to attract foreign fighters.</p>
                    <p>UNOWAS is the implementing agency of the UN Integrated Strategy for the Sahel (UNISS—endorsed in June 2013 by the UN Security Council), which aims to enhance governance, resilience and security in that sub-region, where, from 2016, conflict that had originated in 2012 in Mali spilled over into Burkina Faso and Niger. The SRSG chairs its steering committee. In mid-2022 a regional platform for regional youth was initiated under UNISS.</p>
                    <p>UNOWAS has supported the development of the Accra Initiative, which focuses on strengthening co-operation on security issues in West Africa and the Sahel. In March 2023 UNOWAS helped to organize a Grand Rendez-vous for the Prevention of Violent Extremism in West and Central Africa, in Dakar, which addressed the regional implementation of the UN Action Plan to Prevent Violent Extremism.</p>

          In July 2023 the UN Secretary-General reported, alongside a worsening regional humanitarian situation (given, 
          <i>inter alia</i>
          , elevated prices for food and other essential commodities), a continuing deterioration in the security situation in the Sahel region—notably in Burkina Faso and Mali, where the al-Qa`ida-affiliated Jama'a Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin (JNIM) and Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS) were competing over access to resources and influence and were persistently attacking civilian and military targets. Meanwhile, the reach of terrorist activities and transnational organized crime was spilling over southwards to coastal West African countries; renewed armed incursions into Benin and Togo were reported. In January 2024 the Secretary-General observed that a localized détente had recently arisen between ISGS and JNIM—freeing both groupings to focus more resources towards other targets.

                    <p>UNSCOL was established in February 2007. The mission is the focal point for the core group of donor countries supporting Lebanon (through an annually updated Lebanon Crisis Response Plan), and co-ordinates the UN presence within Lebanon. It works closely with the UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, UNIFIL. The Special Coordinator is responsible for supervising the implementation of Security Council Resolution 1701, which was adopted in August 2006, and called for a cessation of hostilities in Lebanon. UNSCOL comprises divisions of administration, political, co-ordination, public information, and security. The Special Coordinator works closely with the International Support Group (ISG) for Lebanon, which addresses means of supporting Lebanon in view of the impact on the country’s resources of the crisis in neighbouring Syria. The inaugural meeting was convened in October 2019 of a joint UNSCOL-UN Interim Force in Lebanon strategic forum, with a view to enhancing efficiencies between the two entities.</p>

                    <p>In January 2020—following the resignation of the Lebanese Prime Minister, Saad Hariri, in October 2019 (prompted by a wave of national anti-Government protests)—the ISG welcomed the formation of a new Lebanese Government, under the premiership of Hassan Diab. In August 2020 the Special Coordinator expressed solidarity with the victims of the major chemical explosion that had recently devastated the vicinity of the port of Beirut. Widespread demonstrations after the explosion prompted the resignation on 10 August of Prime Minister Diab. Saad Hariri was reappointed as Prime Minister in October; he did not, however, name a new government, and Diab remained in the role of caretaker Prime Minister. UNSCOL subsequently reiterated demands for the prompt formation of an empowered government.</p>
                    <p>In November 2020 the Special Coordinator reported to the UN Security Council that a continuing state of extreme economic crisis in Lebanon, compounded by impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, was generating deep poverty and food insecurity for increasing numbers of citizens and refugees, in a situation where there was no adequate social protection system. In March 2021, as protests intensified across Lebanon, the ISG, meeting in Beirut, noted the accelerating socioeconomic deterioration, urged restraint, and called for transparent investigations into the Beirut port explosion as well as into the murder (in February) of a prominent political activist, Lokman Mohsen Slim. The inaugural meeting was convened in March of a Consultative Group of the Reform, Recovery and Reconstruction Framework (3RF), comprising representatives of the Lebanese Government and civil society, the UN, EU, World Bank, and international donors. In mid-July Hariri withdrew from the process of forming a new administration; in response, President Michel Aoun convened binding consultations, which led to the appointment of Najib Mikati to the premiership (Mikati was a former incumbent of the role). In August the ISG stated regret over fatalities and injuries caused by the recent explosion of a fuel tanker in northern Lebanon; the incident also aggravated ongoing acute fuel shortages, which were causing disruptions to essential services. The Special Coordinator welcomed the formation of a new administration in September, under Prime Minister Mikati, and reaffirmed the UN’s support for strengthening Lebanese sovereignty, stability and political independence. UNSCOL hosted a digital dialogue in April, with participation by Lebanese youth. The Special Coordinator welcomed the conduct of a general election that was held in May. In October she commended a landmark agreement concluded between Lebanon and Israel defining a maritime border between the two countries (thus enabling the economic exploitation of natural gas fields). In November the ISG noted with concern the lack of co-operation among Lebanese political actors who had failed to elect a new President to replace Aoun, whose term of office had ended on 31 October. The Special Coordinator convened a series of consultations with stakeholders, including youth and women’s representatives, political and religious figures, and economic experts who addressed the urgent domestic reforms required as a prerequisite to realizing a provisional staff agreement with the International Monetary Fund that had been reached in April.</p>
                    <p>
          In March 2023, reiterating statements made by the UN Secretary-General and the ISG, the Special Coordinator expressed grave concern over the failure thus far to elect a new Lebanese President and resolve the political vacuum that had prevailed since the end of October 2022. She emphasized that the delay was contributing to the paralysis of state institutions and to the extreme and ever deepening national socioeconomic crisis. From early 2023 UNSCOL oversaw a UNDP-managed financial transfer and accountability mechanism that had been established as a framework for a USA-financed programme that aimed to provide livelihood support to Lebanon’s underfunded security forces. During mid-2023 the Special Coordinator engaged in several rounds of meetings with Lebanese stakeholders, including members of parliament, the commander of the national armed forces, and religious leaders. In early November, in advance of a Joint Arab-Islamic Extraordinary Summit that was convened in that month by the 
          <xr pageref="N" ref="LAS.IO">League of Arab States</xr>
           and 
          <xr pageref="N" ref="OIC.IO">Organization of Islamic Cooperation</xr>
           to discuss the devastating escalation since October of Hamas-Israel conflict, she met with several Arab ambassadors to address the need to shield Lebanon from repercussions of the developing crisis. During that month the Independent Oversight Board of the 3RF strongly urged the Lebanese authorities to adopt an adequate social protection system. In February 2024 the Special Coordinator reiterated the urgent need to de-escalate hostilities in the Blue Line border zone with Israel, which had intensified and expanded in geographical scope since October 2023. She continued in early 2024 to engage with potential donors to secure support for the Lebanese military. In March the UN Secretary-General—while welcoming ongoing efforts by Lebanon’s caretaker authorities to finalize a national emergency preparedness plan—urged that resolute steps be taken towards the election of a new Lebanese President.

                    <p>UNSCO was established in June 1994 after the conclusion of the Declaration of Principles on Interim (Palestinian) Self-Government Arrangements—the Oslo Accord. UNSCO was to seek, during the transition process envisaged by the Declaration, to ensure `an adequate response to the needs of the Palestinian people and to mobilize financial, technical, economic and other assistance’. In 1995 UNSCO’s mandate was reconfigured as the Office of the Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process and Personal Representative of the Secretary-General to the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Palestine (National) Authority (PA). UNSCO has been mandated—in accordance with all relevant UN Security Council resolutions and international law—to assist in all aspects of the humanitarian situation confronting the Palestinian people, and to support negotiations and the implementation of political agreements in pursuit of a resolution of the Palestine-Israeli conflict. A Regional Affairs Unit (RAU) assists in the fulfilment of that part of UNSCO’s mandate that requires it to co-ordinate its work and to co-operate closely with all of the parties to the Middle East peace process. The Special Coordinator collaborates closely with key international actors, in particular those that, together with the UN, constitute the Middle East Quartet, i.e. the European Union, the Russian Federation and the USA, and serves as the Envoy of the UN Secretary-General to the Quartet. Furthermore, the RAU provides technical support for the organization of free, fair and transparent Palestinian elections. UNSCO prepares reports for the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee, which is the main policy-level development assistance co-ordination mechanism for the Palestinian Territories.</p>

                    <p usage="edio ewyb mena">In early 2022 the Special Coordinator repeatedly stated concern at daily violence occurring in the Palestinian Territories and Israel, and at the advancement of (under international law) illegal Israeli planning processes, evictions of Palestinians and demolition of Palestinian structures, for the purpose of constructing illegal settlements. (UN Security Council Resolution 2334, adopted in December 2016, deems Israel's settlement activity on Palestinian territory to be a `flagrant violation’ of international law without legal validity.) In May 2022 UNSCO released a report that urged the adoption of a more strategic approach to addressing the PA’s fiscal and economic crisis. In early August the Special Coordinator expressed deep concern at a `very dangerous’ intensification of violence, following the initiation of an Israeli military aerial offensive aimed at targets in Gaza associated with the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant grouping; the latter had retaliated with, reportedly, 1,100 rocket and mortar attacks against Israel. After three days a ceasefire, mediated by Egypt, entered into effect. The Special Coordinator subsequently repeatedly reiterated alarm at an intensifying cycle of armed clashes between Palestinians and Israeli security forces in the West Bank. In December a hardline Israeli administration took office, further entrenching political polarization. In late February 2023 the Special Coordinator again urged all sides to refrain from aggravating tensions, following an Israel Defense Forces raid that, while targeting three Palestinian militants in Nablus (West Bank), had killed in total 11 Palestinians, and injured many more. However, further armed clashes followed. The Special Coordinator condemned Israeli settler violence against Palestinians and Palestinian attacks against Israelis, and continued to engage with all stakeholders in an attempt to de-escalate the situation. In early April he called on political, religious and community leaders on all sides to reject inflammatory rhetoric and provocative actions. On 9 May the Special Coordinator stated deep alarmed at Israeli air strikes on Gaza that had killed several Palestinian civilians.</p>
                    <p>Addressing the UN Security Council in August 2023 the Special Coordinator noted that in recent months Palestinians and Israelis had been suffering near daily violence; more than 200 Palestinian and nearly 30 Israeli conflict-related fatalities had occurred thus far in 2023, representing the highest total since 2005. (In early July Israeli forces had launched a massive aerial raid against the West Bank’s Jenin camp, that involved at least 10 drone strikes and an estimated 2,000 troops; at least 12 Palestinians, including four children, had been killed, and more than 4,000 people displaced.) Meanwhile, the expansion of illegal Israeli settlements was continuing, and the PA’s fiscal situation was precarious—exacerbated by external humanitarian funding shortages. He urged a focus on de-escalating tensions and working towards a two-state solution.</p>
                    <p>The Special Coordinator vehemently condemned the multi-front assault against Israeli territory that was undertaken on 7 October 2023 by Islamist militants, during which 1,200 people were killed. Subsequently—following Israel’s declaration of a state of war and imposition of a `complete siege’ against Gaza—the Special Coordinator repeatedly deplored all attacks against civilians. In November he welcomed a deal that secured the release of some of the (around 250) hostages who had been abducted from Israel in October, and a brief humanitarian pause. Later in that month, addressing the Security Council, he noted high levels of settler violence and Palestinian displacement in the West Bank, and that an Israeli decision to deduct funding for Gaza from revenues transferred to the PA would further weaken the provision of public services there. In late March 2024 the UN Secretary-General reported that during the period 8 December 2023-18 March 2024 several thousand new Israeli housing units had been advanced or approved in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, while seizures and demolitions of Palestinian-owned structures had continued. At that time the Special Coordinator welcomed the Security Council’s recent adoption of Resolution 2728, which demanded a ceasefire in Gaza. He emphasized that during the past three months around 4,200 women and 6,000 children in the enclave were reported to have been killed as a result of the ongoing conflict. In total, 134 hostages were believed still to be detained there. At least 3,558 Palestinians were reported to be held in Israeli administrative detention, and high levels of violence to be ongoing in the West Bank. He stressed the importance of strengthening the PA to enable it to govern across the Palestinian territories, and the imperative needed to establish an agreed political framework to set the path towards a two-state outcome.</p>

                    <p>UNAMA was established by the UN Security Council in March 2002, in order to fulfil tasks assigned to the UN under the December 2001 Bonn Agreement on provisional arrangements for Afghanistan and to co-ordinate the activities of the UN system in Afghanistan. During 2006-10 UNAMA assisted the Afghan Government with the implementation of the successor Afghanistan Compact, a framework for co-operation between the Afghan authorities, the UN and the international community. During 2010-14 the mission supported the Government in implementing the Afghan-led Afghanistan National Development Strategy: Prioritization and Implementation Plan (`Kabul Process’), aimed at transferring civilian and military responsibilities to full Afghan ownership and leadership. During 2015-August 2021 UNAMA and the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General (SRSG) focused on strengthening Afghan sovereignty, leadership and ownership in the framework of Afghanistan’s Transformation Decade (2015-24). In March 2022, reflecting the altered political landscape arising from the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021, UNAMA was tasked by the UN Security Council with focusing on the co-ordination and facilitation of humanitarian support; the co-ordination of international donors and support agencies; the provision of good offices and outreach; the protection of human rights (the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights hosts the mission’s Human Rights Unit); the promotion of responsible governance and rule of law; and enhancing regional co-operation. It maintains a number of field offices across Afghanistan. In March 2024 the mission’s mandate was extended until 17 March 2025. UNAMA, with the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, co-chairs a Working Group on Counter-Narcotics focused on Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>UNAMA’s electronic Protection of Civilians database has systematically collected and analysed information on casualties of conflict. On-site investigations have also been conducted by the mission to verify reports of civilian casualties.</p>

                    <p usage="edio sasia">From 2013 UNAMA provided secretariat support to an Afghan People’s Dialogue on Peace, and assisted with a series of focus group discussions across the country that were to form the basis of provincial roadmaps for peace. The mission supported the organization of provincial council elections and the first round of a presidential election that were held in April 2014, and the second round of the presidential election staged in June. UNAMA also worked to promote freedom of the media, and provided capacity building and technical assistance to the Independent Election Commission. The preliminary results of the June poll were disputed by one of the presidential candidates, who made allegations of fraud against the authorities. Following partly UN-facilitated negotiations to resolve the impasse, it was agreed that the Commission would—under UNAMA-co-ordinated international supervision—conduct an audit of the 8m. ballots cast. On 26 September the Independent Election Commission declared that Dr Mohammad Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai had secured 55.27% of the vote in the presidential ballot.</p>
                    <p usage="edio sasia">In March 2015 the Security Council welcomed the commencement of Afghanistan’s Transformation Decade (2015-24), and called for UNAMA and the SRSG to continue their role in co-ordinating international civilian efforts, in accordance with the principle of strengthening Afghan sovereignty, leadership and ownership. In January 2016 the mission welcomed the inaugural meeting of a new Quadrilateral Coordination Group (QCG) on Afghanistan, comprising officials from Afghanistan, China, Pakistan and the USA. In mid-September, in an address to the UN Security Council, the SRSG emphasized the urgency of exploring avenues to peace in Afghanistan, and enabling the country to achieve self-reliance. In October 2017 UNAMA, the International Election Commission and the Electoral Complaints Commission adopted a Project Document providing the legal and financial framework for UN and donor support to legislative elections scheduled to be held in the following year (having been postponed from October 2016). The UN Security Council reported in July 2018 that the voter registration process had been completed (and that around one-third of the 8.8m. registered voters were female). The elections were held, as planned on 20 October. In spite of several attacks at polling stations UNAMA expressed satisfaction at voter turnout. In the following month it published a special report on electoral violence.</p>
                    <p usage="edio sasia">Both the incumbent President Dr Ghani and a rival candidate Dr Abdullah Abdullah claimed victory at the (postponed) Afghan presidential election that was held on 28 September 2019. Dr Ghani was controversially formally declared the winner in February 2020. UNAMA welcomed a reduction in violence in February during the course of negotiations between the Taliban leadership and US representatives. On 29 February a USA-Taliban accord was reached, and related declaration issued, incorporating a joint commitment to work towards a peace agreement to end the war in Afghanistan, to protect Afghans’ rights, to contribute to regional stability and to global security, and to pave the way for the initiation of intra-Afghan peace negotiations. Under the deal, US troops were to be reduced to 8,600 by July, and to be fully withdrawn from Afghanistan—ending a two-decade presence there—by mid-2021. The Taliban, in turn, committed to preventing international terrorist groupings from conducting activities from Afghan territory. Also in the context of the agreement and declaration, the Afghan authorities and the Taliban were to release prisoners, as a confidence-building measure. Dr Ghani signed a decree in March 2020 that provided for the release, in two phases, of 5,000 Taliban prisoners (who were obligated not to return to combat). On 11 May, however, the Afghan Government suspended prisoner releases (numbering 1,000 by that stage), claiming that the 276 prisoners hitherto released by the Taliban included civilians who had been abducted after the conclusion of the 29 February agreement. On 12 May the UN Secretary-General strongly condemned terrorist atrocities perpetrated against a Médecins Sans Frontières maternity ward at the Dasht-e-Barchi Hospital in Kabul, in which at least 24 civilians, including women and children, were killed, and against a funeral in Nangarhar. In response to the continuing violence, Dr Ghani announced that the national security forces would resume offensive operations against the Taliban. Days later the SRSG welcomed a power-sharing accord concluded by President Ghani and Dr Abdullah, under which Ghani was to remain as President, while Dr Abdullah was to lead the proposed peace negotiations with the Taliban, and both men were to appoint an equal number of government ministers. A videoconferenced Security Council meeting on Afghanistan held in late June urged the Afghan Government promptly to continue the process of releasing Taliban prisoners, as preparations to enable the initiation of the proposed intra-Afghan talks; eventually agreement on the release of Taliban detainees was reached.</p>
                    <p usage="edio sasia">In mid-September 2020 negotiations aimed at achieving a comprehensive and sustainable peace agreement were initiated, in Doha, Qatar, between the Afghan Government and Taliban leaders. The UN Secretary-General announced at that time that the UN would remain in close contact with both sides. An Afghanistan Partnership Framework (covering 2021-24) and Afghanistan National Peace and Development Plan were agreed at the 2020 Afghanistan Conference, convened under UN auspices, with participation by the SRSG, in a hybrid (part-virtual) format from Geneva, in November. In mid-March 2021, six weeks prior to the (then) scheduled withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan, the Afghan Government and the Taliban, meeting in Moscow, Russian Federation, agreed to try to accelerate the pace of the peace negotiations, which had stalled over allegations by the Government that the Taliban was still instigating violence. At that time the so-called Troika Plus on Afghanistan—USA, the People’s Republic of China, Pakistan and Russia—called for an immediate ceasefire, and urged the Taliban not to launch new offensives, stating that economic and other assistance would be forthcoming once a peace settlement was in place.&#160;In mid-April the deadline for the full withdrawal from Afghanistan of US and allied NATO troops was extended to 11 September (the 20th anniversary of the major 2001 terrorist attacks against the USA). Meanwhile, UNAMA continued to engage with stakeholders at national, regional and international level and to implement local peace initiatives and confidence-building measures, with a particular focus on the inclusion of women and youth. The mission was also promoting measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.</p>
                    <p>
          In early July 2021 representatives of UNAMA participated in a ministerial meeting that was organized by the UN and the Afghan and Turkmen Governments to address the stalled Afghan peace process (initiated in September 2020) and the impact of the ongoing withdrawal of international forces from Afghanistan. The Afghan National Army was proving unable to prevent a very rapid expansion of Taliban militant control over provincial centres and key strategic corridors. The Deputy SRSG urged support for Afghanistan through existing regional formats for co-operation such as the 
          <xr pageref="N" ref="WB0231XD.IO.TXT.44">Shanghai Cooperation Organization</xr>
           and the Troika Plus on Afghanistan (China, Pakistan, Russia and the USA). At the end of July UNAMA strongly condemned an attack against its premises in Herat. In early August the UN Security Council reiterated its support for UNAMA, in the context of escalating conflict, and insisted that any deliberate targeting of civilians or UN personnel could constitute war crimes. On 13 August the UN Secretary-General outlined the dire humanitarian and security crisis that was developing in Afghanistan, reminded the Taliban and national security forces of their legal and moral duty to take all possible measures to protect civilians, and emphasized the carnage that was being caused by urban warfare. He called on the Taliban immediately to halt the offensive and to re-enter, in good faith, into the negotiations process towards an Afghan-led political settlement. On 15 August the Taliban, having swiftly captured almost all of Afghanistan’s other cities, took control of Kabul and stated the intent of declaring an Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. The incumbent Afghan President, Dr Mohammad Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai, fled the country. It was reported soon afterwards that UNAMA personnel had been relocated on a temporary basis to AlmatI, Kazakhstan. In mid-September the UN Security Council requested UNAMA to continue to co-ordinate humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people. From August onwards senior UNAMA and other UN representatives interacted regularly with the new Taliban authorities to advocate for the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms. Girls’ right to education and women’s right to participate fully in public and political life were particularly emphasized. The mission continued to engage with women’s organizations and other civil society stakeholders. In late September the Taliban suspended the national Constitution, pending a review of the compliance of existing laws with Shari`a.
        </p>
                    <p usage="edio sasia">In January 2022 the UN Secretary-General reported that, while the overall level of conflict had significantly decreased, Afghanistan was facing multiple crises, including the lack of an inclusive government, a massive economic contraction and a mounting humanitarian emergency. Although the Taliban authorities had announced amnesties for members of the former administration and security forces, UNAMA had received credible allegations of killings and of enforced disappearances. At that time the UN Secretary-General—emphasizing that Afghanistan was a diverse multi-ethnic society—recommended that the future overall UN political presence there should comprise two pillars: political/governance and humanitarian/development. Addressing an Economy of Afghanistan Conference that was convened by the Taliban in January, the SRSG emphasized that innovation—necessitating education for all (including for girls and women), technical capacity, creativity and diversity—underpins economic growth.</p>
                    <p>In March 2022 the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 2626, which provided for the continued formal presence in Afghanistan of UNAMA and other UN agencies. The mission was tasked with co-ordinating and facilitating the provision of essential humanitarian support to the population of Afghanistan; co-ordinating international donors and agencies that were working to supply the basic needs of the Afghan population; facilitating structured policy dialogue between stakeholders; extending good offices and outreach; promoting responsible governance and rule of law; monitoring the situation of civilians; advocating for the human rights of all Afghans (including the protection of women’s and girls’ rights); protecting children and reporting on abuses against them; supporting regional co-operation; and supporting existing mechanisms to improve the security situation in Afghanistan. Gender mainstreaming was designated a cross-cutting dimension of the mission’s mandate. Mine action to clear improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and other unexploded remnants of war was to be a priority of the UN presence. Later in March, the UN Secretary-General stated deep regret over a recently reported decision by the Taliban formally to suspend secondary education provision for girls. Shortly afterwards the UN Security Council also stated great concern at this development, and requested the SRSG to continue to advocate for girls’ right to education. In early May UNAMA stated deep concern at a recent Taliban directive that women should only leave their homes in circumstances where this was necessary, should cover their faces when appearing in public, and that violations of the directive would lead to the punishment of male relatives.</p>
                    <p>In mid-December 2022 the SRSG stated great concern at recent terrorist attacks (that caused significant civilian casualties) against the embassies of the Russian Federation (in September) and Pakistan (earlier in December), as well as against a hotel accommodating many Chinese nationals (also in December). In the same month UNAMA deplored a decree by the Taliban that banned women’s participation in higher education. The UN Secretary-General protested a Taliban edict that was publicized shortly afterwards that also withdrew women’s right to work for non-governmental and international organizations. In late April 2023 the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2681, which condemned the Taliban’s recent decision to ban Afghan women from working for UN agencies in that country and expressed concern that it would severely impact the ability of UNAMA to implement its mandate.</p>
                    <p>In June 2023 the UN Secretary-General reported that the Taliban was continuing to consolidate its hold on power, and was—by means of repressive measures—maintaining national stability. Unprecedented levels of humanitarian need were reported across all 34 provinces of Afghanistan. A new UN Strategic Framework for Afghanistan, covering the period 2023-25, was launched in July by the SRSG, who reiterated the need for an enabling environment to be provided by the Taliban authorities to ensure its effectiveness in supporting the Afghan people to meet their basic needs. In August UNAMA released a report that addressed human rights abuses that had been perpetrated during the period 15 August 2021-30 June 2023 against former Afghan government and security officials—including 424 incidents of arbitrary arrests and detention, 144 of ill treatment and torture, 218 extrajudicial killings, and 14 enforced disappearances. The report found that only extremely limited efforts, lacking in transparency, had been made by the Taliban authorities to investigate these crimes. In November the Taliban issued a directive that prohibited women from participation in certain types of health care work.</p>
                    <p>In January 2024 the UN Secretary-General reported a recent decrease in attacks in Afghanistan by Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant-Khorasan, attributed to both a change in strategy and the impact of counter-terrorism efforts by the Taliban. In mid-February he organized, in Doha, Qatar, the second in a series of meetings of special envoys on Afghanistan, to address means of expanding structured international engagement. (The first had been held in May 2023.) At the end of that month he reported that the Taliban was continuing to curtail women’s rights in all spheres of public life—including through the arrest and detention of women deemed not to be in full compliance with the enforced the use of hijabs. Attacks targeting the Hazara Shi’a and other minority communities, as well as against former government and security force members, were reported to be ongoing: the Taliban was urged to hold the perpetrators to account. In early 2024 UNAMA was continuing to facilitate outreach meetings addressing governance-related issues, including with regard to human rights and to service delivery. The mission was liaising with the Taliban over the treatment of detainees.</p>
                    <p usage="edio sasia">By January 2024 a Special Trust Fund for Afghanistan (established in 2021) had mobilized US&#8201;$212.1m. to support the delivery of basic supplies to the country, through integrated initiatives, with a strong focus on promoting women’s participation. Also in January, the first disbursement from a Fund for the Afghan People was agreed: this aimed to resolve Afghanistan’s arrears with the Asian Development Bank.</p>

                    <p>UNAMI was founded by Security Council Resolution 1500 (14 August 2003), expanded on 10 August 2007 by Resolution 1770, to support post-conflict Iraq. On 19 August 2003, just after the mission’s inception, terrorist attacks on the UNAMI headquarters in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, killed the first Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General (SRSG) for Iraq, Sergio Vieira de Mello, and 21 other UN personnel. UN international staff were subsequently withdrawn from Iraq, until the formation of the Iraqi Interim Government at the end of June 2004.</p>
                    <p>Security Council Resolution 2631, adopted in May 2022, tasked the mission with supporting the advancement of inclusive political dialogue and reconciliation; efforts to strengthen electoral preparation and processes; security sector reform; regional dialogue and co-operation; co-ordination and delivery of humanitarian and medical assistance; dignified returns or local integration of refugees and displaced persons; the strengthening of essential services; efforts to advance human rights and judicial and legal reforms; gender mainstreaming; the strengthening of child protection; and structured dialogue between the Iraqi Government and the Kurdistan Regional Government. In May 2023 the UN Security Council extended the mission’s mandate until 31 May 2024, its core tasks unaltered. The SRSG was requested to prioritize the extension of assistance to the Iraqi authorities and people with regard to advancing inclusive political dialogue and national reconciliation. The SRSG and UNAMI were to assist the authorities in strengthening electoral processes, implementing constitutional provisions, developing processes for resolving disputed internal boundaries, and implementing security sector reforms. The UN Secretary-General was requested to provide to the Security Council an independent strategic review of UNAMI, in consultation with the Government of Iraq. In October 2023 the Secretary-General appointed Volker Perthes (a German diplomat and academic) as the Head of the Independent Strategic Review. UNAMI comprises an Office of Political Affairs and Analysis, an Office of Electoral Assistance, a Development Support Office, a Human Rights Office (HRO), a Public Information Office, and a Gender Unit.</p>
                    <p>In early 2007 UNAMI facilitated and observed the process of establishing Iraq’s Independent High Electoral Commission (IHEC), and subsequently the mission has supported the IHEC in capacity and institution building. UNAMI participates in meetings of the IHEC Board of Commissioners, and has served in an impartial advisory capacity in the process of selecting commissioners.</p>

                    <p>With regard to reconstruction and development, UNAMI aims to address the long-term challenge of achieving sustainable food security; to strengthen the overall quality of education and service delivery at all levels; to support policy development, and preserve and conserve the tangible and intangible Iraqi cultural heritage; to improve the human development situation in Iraq and promote good governance; to support the national health strategy of the Iraqi Ministry of Health in meeting basic health needs; to formulate and implement programmes on institutional/policy reform, capacity building, and service provision necessary to rehabilitate and develop the infrastructure of human settlements; and to support the Iraqi authorities in providing adequate assistance and effective protection to, and durable solutions for, uprooted populations in Iraq.</p>
                    <p usage="edio mena">In September 2017 the UN Secretary-General described as `destabilizing’ a referendum on possible independence organized unilaterally in that month by the Kurdistan Regional Government, including in areas—such as Kirkuk—that were not recognized by the Iraqi federal authorities as belonging to Kurdistan. In mid-November UNAMI urged the Kurdistan authorities to acknowledge a decision by the Iraq federal Supreme Court which confirmed that the September referendum in Kurdistan violated the provisions of the national Constitution and that therefore its results and effects should be annulled. In December UNAMI expressed deep concern over reports of violent unrest during demonstrations in the Sulaymaniyah area, urged restraint both by protesters and by the local authorities, and dispatched a fact-finding team. UNAMI subsequently undertook a series of meetings with Kurdistan youth that were aimed at fostering mutual understanding.</p>
                    <p usage="edio mena">UNAMI helped to organize a series of roundtable discussions in late 2017, with the aim of facilitating national reconciliation. In December the Iraqi authorities declared victory over Islamic State. In total, more than 4.5m. Iraqis had been liberated from the terrorist occupation. In mid-February 2018, at an International Conference for the Reconstruction of Iraq, convened in Kuwait, the UN Secretary-General launched an Iraq Recovery and Resilience Programme that had nine components, of which six were national in scope, and three were focused on building trust and economic opportunities in high-risk communities to prevent the emergence of violent extremism. UNAMI assisted the IHEC with the preparations for national and provincial elections that were held on 12 May—including by facilitating the participation of displaced persons in the elections, and with the utilization of new technology for managing election results.</p>
                    <p usage="edio mena">In early January 2020 the UN Secretary-General cautioned maximum restraint in response to the assassination on 2 January, on Iraqi soil, by a US air strike, of General Qassem Soleimani, commander of the elite Quds Force unit of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps. The global coalition against Islamic State immediately suspended its combat operations in Iraq to focus on protecting its bases. On 6 January the Iraqi legislature passed a non-binding resolution demanding that foreign military forces withdraw from Iraq and cease using its land, waters and airspace.</p>
                    <p>The UN Secretary-General stated in February 2021 that the mission was continuing to report killings, other violence, abductions, disappearances and torture of participants arising from a wave of anti-Government protests that was initiated in central and southern areas of Iraq in October 2019 and was still ongoing. UNAMI extended enhanced technical support to the IHEC in advance of legislative elections that were held in October 2021 (postponed from June). In November the UN Secretary-General reported that the elections had been peaceful and well-managed. At that time the SRSG, participating in a conference that took place in Erbil to address gender equality and women’s empowerment strategies, welcomed the increased participation of women in the recent election, both as candidates and as voters. In March 2022 UNAMI issued a gender analysis of the October 2021 polls, which found that, of the 95 female candidates, 57 women (from 16 governorates) had won seats independently of the quota framework that had been in place. At the end of August—in response to an outbreak of violent protests in Iraq that had been prompted by the resignation of a key political actor, in the context of continued failure to achieve agreement on the composition of a new government—UNAMI urged a de-escalation of tensions, and respect for dialogue and for constitutional order. In October UNAMI welcomed the designation of a new government, under the premiership of Mohammed S. al-Sudani. In November 2023 UNAMI and the Iraqi Women Journalists Forum conducted a joint training event in Mosul (Nineveh). UNAMI engaged with relevant stakeholders, including the IHEC and a High Committee to Support Women’s Political Participation, in advance of Governorate Council elections that were held, in an orderly manner, in December. In January 2024 the UN Secretary-General reported that UNAMI was continuing to organize rounds of consultations with relevant parties to support the implementation of an agreement that had been concluded in October 2020 between the authorities in Baghdad and Erbil (Kurdistan) that was focused on establishing a new administrative structure in Sinjar (in Nineveh Governorate, northern Iraq).</p>
                    <p>The SRSG has repeatedly strongly condemned terrorist atrocities perpetrated in Iraq.</p>
                    <p>UNAMI’s HRO has prepared a series of reports addressing the human rights situation in Iraq, and has documented systematic and widespread severe violations of rights and of international humanitarian law perpetrated by Islamic State and affiliated armed groups, including murders, abductions and rape of civilians, looting, the trafficking and enslavement of women and children, the forced recruitment of children, and wanton destruction of places of religious or cultural significance.</p>
                    <p usage="edio mena">In March 2021 the UN Under-Secretary-General and SRSG on Sexual Violence in Conflict welcomed the recent adoption by the Iraqi Council of Representatives of a Yazidi Survivors’ Law, encompassing reparations, rehabilitation, and reintegration support (including through pensions, education, land, and public sector employment quota allocations) for members of the Yazidi, Christian, Shabak and Turkmen communities who had been subjected by Islamic State to crimes such as abductions and sexual violence.</p>
                    <p>In September 2017 the UN Security Council requested the Secretary-General to establish an independent investigative team, to be headed by a Special Adviser, to support Iraq’s efforts in holding Islamic State accountable for its actions. The ensuing UN Investigative Team to Promote Accountability for Crimes Committed by Da’esh/ISIL (UNITAD) was tasked with collecting and preserving evidence of acts committed by Islamic State that might amount to war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. The Special Adviser was appointed in May 2018. In May 2021 the Head of UNITAD announced the completion of initial investigations into Islamic State attacks that had been perpetrated against the Yazidi community in Sinjar, and into the mass killing of unarmed military cadets and personnel at the Tikrit Air Academy in June 2014, and reported that `clear and convincing evidence’ had been established that genocide had been perpetrated against the Yazidis. In January 2023 the SRSG welcomed a decree by the Iraqi Council of Ministers that granted Yazidis ownership of residential lands and houses in Sinjar. In September 2023 the UN Security Council effected the fifth and final extension of UNITAD’s mandate (until 17 September 2024).</p>

                    <heading>Establishment and Mandate</heading>
                    <p>The UN Assistance Mission in Somalia (UNSOM) was authorized by the UN Security Council in May 2013, under Resolution 2102, to supersede the former Political Office for Somalia (established in 1995). UNSOM was mandated to provide UN good offices functions in support of the peace and reconciliation process of the Federal Government of Somalia (inaugurated in August 2012); to monitor and help to prevent abuses of human rights and of humanitarian law; and to support the Federal Government and the African Union (AU) Mission in Somalia (AMISOM; on 31 March 2022 AMISOM was superseded by the AU Transition Mission in Somalia). UNSOM’s activities cover political affairs, integrated electoral support, support for rule of law and security institutions, preventing and countering violent extremism, human rights and protection, gender equality, women’s and youth empowerment, community recovery and extension of state authority and accountability, and environment (in particular furthering understanding of the nexus between climate issues and the root causes of violence in Somalia). UNSOM was requested by the Federal Government to deploy across Somalia, and by 2024 was maintaining offices in Mogadishu (the Somali capital), Baidoa, Beledweyne, Garoowe (Puntland), Hargeisa (Somaliland), Kismaayo. An agreement to establish an office in Dhusamareb (Galmudug) was concluded in February 2023; construction work was initiated in June.</p>
                    <p>The Mogadishu-based UN Support Office in Somalia (UNSOS), established in November 2015, extends critical logistics assistance to UNSOM, and generally in support of peacebuilding activities.</p>
               </p-group>
               <p-group>
                    <heading>Activities</heading>
                    <p>The Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General (SRSG) undertakes mediation and good offices activities aimed at promoting reconciliation and dialogue, engaging with local leaders, the Federal Government, and with international partners. UNSOM has assisted the Federal Government with the development of a human rights roadmap, and has provided training for police and law enforcement officers, and human rights and humanitarian law guidance for personnel from the national armed forces. The mission has worked to eliminate the recruitment of children into the national military and into militias. The SRSG has repeatedly condemned atrocities by the terrorist organization al-Shabaab, and the serial targeting of members of the Somali Federal Parliament for assassination.</p>
                    <p usage="edio ass">In August 2020 the SRSG noted that the legal framework underpinning pending legislative and presidential elections had not been completed and that the necessary security arrangements were not yet in place. He urged broad-based co-operation among national stakeholders. On 17 September a model was broadly agreed, providing for an indirect voting format. (The SRSG subsequently urged that a one-person-one-vote universal suffrage model should be developed.) In December UNSOM police assumed responsibility for the co-ordination of election security training.</p>
                    <p>
          During 2021 UNSOM and UNDP jointly undertook to support the electoral process, through the extension of good offices and of technical, operational and logistical assistance. Owing to contention concerning the composition of the electoral management bodies and certain outstanding regional electoral issues, the planned legislative and presidential polls (which had been scheduled for February) were postponed, prompting violent unrest in Mogadishu. The UN Secretary-General stated grave concern over the violence, urging all parties to exercise restraint and calm. He called on the Federal Government and leaders of the Federal States urgently to reach consensus on a means of proceeding with the planned elections, on the basis of the so-called 17 September electoral model. He also urged respect for the right to peaceful assembly. Several rounds of Somali political consultations were subsequently held, seeking a resolution of the impasse. In mid-April UN and other international partners collectively stated deep concern over a recent decision by the Somali legislature to replace the `17 September’ agreement with a different electoral process that entailed a lengthy extension to the current presidential and parliamentary mandates. Later in the month they strongly condemned an eruption of violence in Mogadishu, reiterating that adherence to the 17 September arrangement should represent the only model for the electoral process, and that an extension of government mandates would cause a destabilizing political crisis. They stated particular concern over emerging fragmentation of the Somali National Army into clan-based factions. In late May they welcomed the decision made by a Federal Government of Somalia-Federal Member States summit, held on 27 May, to hold presidential and parliamentary elections promptly (within two months; this schedule was not, however, met), and thanked President Farmajo for having appealed at the beginning of the month for a reversion to the consensus-based 17 September electoral model. In mid-2021 the SRSG and representatives of AMISOM, the 
          <xr pageref="N" ref="IGAD.IO">Intergovernmental Authority on Development</xr>
           and the European Union (EU) visited Somalia’s federal member states with the aim of fostering constructive engagement in the electoral preparations. Legislative elections were initiated in November and were due to be completed on 15 March 2022; by that time, however, 40 of the 275 seats in the lower house remained unelected. The UN, AU, and other international partners issued a collective statement in mid-March that urged the prompt completion of the electoral process, and emphasized the need to adhere to a 30% quota of female parliamentarians. In late March the UN Security Council condemned a series of deadly terrorist attacks mounted by al-Shabaab with the stated intent of destabilizing the process. On 31 March the UN Security Council endorsed the new AU Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS), that replaced AMISOM. ATMIS was tasked with reducing the threat posed by al-Shabaab, assisting efforts to build the capacity of the Somali security and police forces, supporting national peacebuilding and reconciliation activities, and with undertaking a phased transfer of security responsibilities to Somalia. Senators and members of parliament were eventually inaugurated in mid-April (women having secured only 21% of the seats), and preparations for a presidential poll ensued. In early May 2022 the Security Council strongly condemned an al-Shabaab terrorist attack against an ATMIS operating base that caused the deaths of 10 Burundian troops. The SRSG welcomed the decisive election on 15 May of a new Somalian President, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud (marking the completion of the lengthy electoral process). Mohamud was inaugurated in early June. The SRSG subsequently continued to engage with regional leaders. He deplored continued sporadic terrorist atrocities (these included a lethal al-Shabaab attack in Mogadishu at the end of October that caused more than 100 fatalities).
        </p>
                    <p>The reported mobilization of armed groups, and persistent violence in Laascaanood (Somaliland), causing destruction of civilian infrastructure and widespread displacement, was condemned in early 2023; the UN and other international partners demanded an immediate de-escalation. In May landmark one-person-one-vote district council elections were organized in Puntland. In June the UN Secretary-General welcomed the Frontline States Initiative, including a Front Line States Task Force, which had been launched earlier in the year by Somalia and neighbouring states (Djibouti, Ethiopia and Kenya), with a view to advancing collective security activities aimed at countering al-Shabaab. In that context, the anti-al-Shabaab `Operation Black Lion’ was ongoing at that time. In June an UNSOM-UNDP joint programme on state-building and reconciliation was launched. The UN and other international partners urged the immediate de-escalation of tensions in Garowe in June, and, again, in Laascaanood, in August. In the latter month ATMIS and the Front Line States Task Force determined to strengthen collaboration. Concern was stated by the UN and other international partners in November over the mobilization of forces in Garowe. In January 2024 they welcomed the peaceful organization of a presidential election in Puntland. In that month the SRSG condemned a mortar attack that struck Aden Adde International Airport area, in Mogadishu, killing a UN guard. During the period 6 October 2023-24 January 2024 UNSOM reported 84 conflict-related civilian fatalities in Somalia. At the end of March 2024 the UN and other international partners commended national efforts to ensure Somalia’s compliance with international and regional human rights obligations, and acknowledged the intention of the authorities to finalize a national Constitution.</p>
                    <p>The UN, ATMIS, EU, Türkiye, UK and USA meet regularly, under Federal Government of Somalia auspices, as core security partners.</p>

               <p-group id="PB.IO.BINUH.2">
                    <heading>Establishment and Mandate</heading>
                    <p>
          In June 2019 the UN Security Council authorized the establishment of the mission (the Bureau Intégré des Nations Unies en Haïti—BINUH), to follow on from an outgoing UN peacekeeping operation, with a mandate to contribute to multilateral efforts to consolidate peace and stability, as well as to further sustainable development in that country. BINUH became operational in mid-October. It was to advise the Haiti authorities on, 
          <i>inter alia,</i>
           strengthening the rule of law; developing a peaceful and stable environment, including through promoting human rights and supporting an inclusive inter-Haitian national dialogue; assisting governmental efforts to hold free, fair, and transparent elections; reinforcing the capacity of the Haitian National Police (HNP) in areas such as human rights, crowd control, maintaining public order, and gang violence response; developing an inclusive approach to reducing community violence; addressing human rights abuses; promoting compliance with international human rights obligations; improving prison standards; and strengthening the justice sector.
        </p>
                    <p>BINUH comprises an advisory political and good governance unit with a focus on promoting good governance, elections, constitutional reform, justice, and public sector accountability; a unit addressing gang violence, community violence reduction, and weapons and munitions management; a police and corrections unit (led by a UN Police Commissioner); a security unit; a human rights unit; and a mission support unit. BINUH was authorized to mainstream gender considerations in its work, as a cross-cutting issue.</p>
                    <p usage="edio sacac">In January 2020 BINUH and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights jointly issued a report that addressed an outbreak of extreme gang violence that had occurred in November 2019 in the deprived Bel Air neighbourhood of the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince. The report concluded that Bel Air residents had not received adequate protection from the Haitian authorities.</p>
                    <p usage="edio sacac">Legislative elections that were initially to have been held in Haiti in October 2019 were postponed. From late 2019 opposition unrest escalated and demands intensified for the resignation of President Jovenel Moïse—whose rule was conducted by decree from January 2020, following the dissolution of the national legislature. In September 2020 President Moïse issued a decree that installed all nine members of the Provisional Electoral Council (the previous membership having resigned in July). Formal electoral assistance from the UN was requested in November. In January 2021 it was decreed that the first round of the postponed legislative elections would be rescheduled to September, to be held concurrently with a first round of a presidential election. Second rounds of the elections, and local and municipal polls, were to be held in November. A referendum on a new Constitution was to be organized in April (all subsequently postponed).</p>
                    <p usage="edio sacac">In February 2021 the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General reported on recent significant opposition discontent, marked by protests, a failed attempted coup against President Jovenel Moïse on 7 February (on which date opposition activists had demanded that he should leave office), and the self-appointment as interim Head of State by a senior judge in that month. She outlined growing concerns over shrinking civic space, citing a decree on public security issued in November 2020 that had overly defined terrorist actions to encompass, for example, acts of vandalism, and an increase in threats targeted at lawyers, journalists, human rights defenders and members of the judiciary. She also stated deep concern over a recent resurgence of kidnappings, and persistent impunity for serious crimes. In late March large-scale demonstrations took place in Port-au-Prince and in other cities to protest the pending referendum on a new Constitution (which was to extend domestic political rights to the Haitian diaspora). Violence was reported in Bel Air in early April, resulting in three fatalities. On 7 July the UN Secretary-General condemned in the strongest terms the assassination of President Moïse, perpetrated by armed attackers at his residence in Pétion-Ville, Port-au-Prince. On 20 July Ariel Henry was inaugurated as acting President and acting Prime Minister. In August BINUH offered its full support to the Haitian authorities in the aftermath of a 7.2 magnitude earthquake, followed by flooding, that caused more than 2,200 fatalities and devastation in the Grand'Anse, Nippes and Sud areas of Haiti. Following the dismissal in September of a Moïse-appointed Provisional Electoral Council, national elections were postponed indefinitely.</p>
                    <p>
          In December 2021 the UN Secretary-General appointed an independent expert to lead a strategic assessment of BINUH’s mandate. The conclusions of the assessment, presented to UN Security Council members in April 2022, determined that BINUH should be empowered to continue its good offices and to scale-up support to the HNP to counter endemic gang violence. In February, the UN Secretary-General had strongly condemned an `alarming’ surge of criminal gang-related violence in Port-au-Prince, emphasizing the catastrophic effects of such disorder on the fundamental rights of Haitian citizens and on the Haitian economy. In October the Council unanimously approved targeted sanctions (including an arms embargo, asset freezes and a travel ban) against individuals participating in or facilitating gang violence. In that month BINUH and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights issued a report titled 
          <publ-name>Sexual violence in Port-au-Prince: a weapon used by gangs to instill fear</publ-name>
          , which stated that gang elements were using collective rapes (including of children and elderly people) as a tool of social control. At that time 60% of Port-au-Prince was reported to be dominated by armed gangs, whose sophisticated weapons were being trafficked into Haiti. An agreement on a National Consensus for an Inclusive Transition and Transparent Elections, signed in December by acting President and Prime Minister Ariel Henry and by opposition and civil society representatives, provided for a 14-month transition that included the establishment of transitional bodies and was intended to culminate in the inauguration of a newly elected government in February 2024. This schedule was not, however, adhered to.
        </p>
                    <p>In January 2023 the SRSG emphasized that political progress in Haiti would remain fragile without the deployment of an international specialized force to operate in conjunction with the HNP. A UN report issued in February found that, in a `nightmare’ environment beyond state control, mass incidents of murder, gang rape and indiscriminate lethal sniper attacks had escalated in the very impoverished community of Cité Soleil (near Port-au-Prince). In a joint report issued in May, BINUH and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights emphasized incidents of indiscriminate extreme violence, and an increase in vigilantism, including mob killings and lynchings of alleged gang members (164 murders were reported to have been perpetrated by vigilantes in April). A new SRSG, appointed in April, engaged local support for national dialogue and advocated for enhanced international assistance. BINUH and UNDP supported the organization during late May of a national political forum, in Port-au-Prince, with participation by a broad range of stakeholders. The forum issued a declaration that urged the deployment of `robust’ international operational support for the HNP, and the formulation of a national security policy. A further gathering of stakeholders was convened in the following month by CARICOM, in Kingston, Jamaica. In July the UN Secretary-General observed that the scope of a citizens’ vigilante movement, `Bwa Kale’, had extended from metropolitan Port-au-Prince to all 10 Haitian departments; a gang grouping, `Zam Pale’, was countering Bwa Kale. At the beginning of October, at Haiti’s request, the deployment was authorized by the UN Security Council of a new mission—the Multinational Security Support (MSS)—that was tasked with supporting the efforts of the HNP to quell the ongoing gang violence. The deployment of the MSS was, however, subsequently delayed. Eventually, on 1 March 2024, Kenya formally agreed to supply 1,000 officers to the mission. Shortly afterwards Haiti spiralled further into gang-led anarchy. On 11 March gang elements (which by then had control of around 80% of Port-au-Prince) forced the resignation of Ariel Henry. At that time a meeting of Haitian stakeholders and international development partners, convened under the auspices of CARICOM, agreed that a Transitional Presidential Council (comprising seven voting members and two observers) should be established and that the new Council should swiftly appoint an Interim Prime Minister; an inclusive Council of Ministers should then be established.</p>
                    <p>BINUH documented more than 8,400 direct victims of gang violence in 2023; 83% of gang-led atrocities occurred in Port-au-Prince, and the scope of such violence spread in that year into Artibonite (rural central Haiti). The mission has continued to facilitate inter-Haitian discussions among national stakeholders, addressing governance reforms, security, civic participation and elections, and to train and advise the HNP.</p>
                    <p usage="edio ewyb sacac">BINUH, UNDP, the HNP and other partners co-ordinate the Joint Programme for the HNP, a multi-donor basket fund on security in Haiti that was initiated in early 2022.</p>
                    <p usage="edio sacac">BINUH was also mandated to work on so-called legacy issues from previous UN peacekeeping missions. These included supporting efforts to eliminate cholera (an estimated 780,000 people in Haiti were infected with cholera during October 2010-October 2016, resulting in more than 9,000 fatalities), and addressing cases of sexual exploitation of civilians by UN troops.</p>
                    <p usage="edio ewyb sacac">BINUH supported efforts to address a severe outbreak of cholera that arose in Haiti in October 2022 and was ongoing in 2024.</p>

          UNOAU was established by Resolution 64/288 of the UN General Assembly, on 1 July 2010, with a mandate to enhance the partnership between the UN and 
          <xr pageref="N" ref="AU.IO">African Union (AU)</xr>
           with respect to peace and security; to provide co-ordinated and consistent UN advice to the AU on short-term operational support matters and on long-term capacity building; and to render the UN presence in Addis Ababa more efficient in delivering support to the AU.

                    <p>UNOAU’s Division of Political Affairs promotes the development of strategic partnerships between the two organizations, in support of regional security mechanisms. The second principal Division, of Peacekeeping, Planning and Management, provides technical, logistical and administrative assistance to AU peace support operations. In particular, it focuses on child protection, counter-terrorism, mine action, small and light weapons, and disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes. A UN-AU Joint Task Force on Peace and Security convenes regularly. Informal co-ordination meetings are regularly facilitated between the AU Peace and Security Council leadership and incoming UN Security Council presidencies.</p>

                    <p>In April 2017 the inaugural UN-AU Annual Conference was convened, at which the UN Secretary-General and the Chairperson of the AU Commission endorsed a Joint UN-AU Framework for Enhanced Partnerships in Peace and Security. The second annual UN-AU Conference, held in July 2018, endorsed an Action Plan on the AU-UN Framework for the Implementation of the AU’s Agenda 2063 and UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The seventh session of the Conference, convened in November 2023, determined to establish a biannual bilateral High-Level Strategic Dialogue on Sustainable Development. The fourth trilateral AU-European Union-UN meeting was organized in September of that year, at the UN’s headquarters in New York.</p>

It is also mandated to work closely with UN and other entities to address cross-border challenges, such as organized crime, trafficking in arms, and the activities of armed groups. In August 2021 the Security Council extended UNOCA’s mandate until 31 August 2024.

          UNOCA's priority areas of activity include supporting conflict mediation, and, where requested, assisting with the peaceful conduct of elections in the region; facilitating cohesion in the general regional work of the UN, including in partnership with other agencies; promoting activities in partnership with the private sector and civil society networks; co-ordinating UN efforts in the region against armed groups; undertaking studies on regional challenges and threats; providing technical assistance aimed at advancing early warning and mediation capabilities; helping to build the capacity of

          ; strengthening the professional capacities of media workers in the region; promoting the formulation of a regional integrated approach to addressing cross-border insecurity; and combating maritime insecurity in the Gulf of Guinea. UNOCA has focused on the threats to regional stability caused by illicit cross-border movements, poaching and illegal trade in wildlife, and the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General (SRSG) has promoted the development of an integrated regional anti-poaching approach. UNOCA acts as the secretariat of the UN Standing Advisory Committee on Security Questions in Central Africa, through which several regional arms control and confidence-building measures have been adopted, such as the 2010 Central African Convention for the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons, their Ammunition, and All Parts and Components for their Manufacture, Repair and Assembly (Kinshasa Convention), which entered into force in March 2017. In October 2020 the UN Secretary-General approved a UN Strategy for Peace Consolidation, Conflict Prevention and Conflict Resolution in the Great Lakes region.

          A Regional Strategy to Address the Threat and Impact of the Activities of the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA)—developed by UNOCA to address the challenges posed by the armed grouping to civilians in the Central African Republic (CAR), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), South Sudan and Uganda—was endorsed by the UN Security Council in June 2012. The SRSG and 
          <xr pageref="N" ref="AU.IO">African Union</xr>
           (AU) Special Envoy on the LRA have undertaken joint diplomatic missions to areas affected by the LRA. In mid-2023 the UN Secretary-General reported that LRA raids on local communities and abductions of civilians were continuing, including, in February-March, in Bas-Ulélé (DRC).

                    <p>UNOCA has reported regularly to the UN Security Council on the activities of the terrorist grouping Boko Haram in the Lake Chad Basin area and northern Nigeria. UNOCA has conducted regular missions to investigate the impact of Boko Haram’s atrocities on the region, and to explore ways in which the UN might provide support to local communities. In August 2020 UNOCA and UNOWAS were designated as co-leaders of the governance cluster of the regional task force guiding the Regional Stabilization, Recovery and Resilience Strategy for Areas Affected by Boko Haram in the Lake Chad Basin Region (adopted in August 2018 by the Lake Chad Basin Commission—LCBC). In March 2021 UNOCA engaged in a regional expert consultation on the gender dimensions of the prosecution, rehabilitation and reintegration of former Boko Haram members. UNOCA participated in a workshop in March 2022 that addressed the preparation of a regional action plan (that was adopted later in the month by the LCBC) to support the implementation of the Regional Stabilization, Recovery and Resilience Strategy during 2022-24.</p>

                    <p usage="ass">The SRSG consistently emphasized the UN’s support for dialogue and readiness to assist national decentralization efforts within the framework of the Cameroonian Constitution, in response to the escalation from November 2017 of violent unrest in anglophone western areas of Cameroon. In July 2020 the SRSG called for increased international engagement and co-ordination on resolving the situation in Cameroon. UNOCA and partner agencies organized two workshops in September, in Douala and Krabi, that addressed the protection of media workers. At the request of the Cameroonian authorities the SRSG visited Cameroon in March 2021. Meanwhile, he maintained lines of communication with leaders of exiled Cameroonian armed groups. In January 2023 the Canadian Government announced that it had mediated informal discussions, held in Québec and Ontario, Canada, between the Cameroonian Government and Anglophone delegations, with UN participation, and that agreement had been reached on initiating a negotiations process to resolve the protracted crisis. The Cameroonian authorities, however, subsequently rejected the initiation of a formal externally-mediated negotiations framework. In May UNOCA reported an escalation in local violence against civilians committed by Boko Haram and ISWAP militants, in particular in Cameroon’s Far North Region. A major operation, `Scorpion’, was conducted by the MNJTF at that time against terrorist strongholds in Cameroon.</p>
                    <p usage="ass">In March 2023 UNOCA took part in an electoral needs assessment mission to Chad, in advance of a constitutional referendum that was scheduled to be staged in November and presidential and legislative elections that were to be held in 2024, at the end of an ongoing transition period. (In April 2021, following the killing by rebels of Chadian President Idriss Déby, military leaders had installed Déby's son, Gen. Mahamat Déby Itno, as head of a transitional military council.) In early September 2023—in view of a seizure of power in Gabon at the end of August by that country’s military—the SRSG urged the development of strong democratic institutions and structures there. In late February 2024 the SRSG stated great concern over recent violent unrest in N'Djamena, Chad.</p>

           which addressed six linkages between climate change and peace and security in the region: increased human mobility; increased intercommunal violence (particularly between herders and farmers); increased organized crime, and activities by non-state armed groups; a rise in maritime crime and piracy; a rise in land conflicts and food insecurity; and increased risk to the Congo Basin rainforest.

                    <p>Following the outbreak of conflict in Libya in February 2011, UNSMIL was established in September with a mandate to support Libya's transitional authorities in restoring public security and the rule of law; promoting inclusive political dialogue and national reconciliation; and embarking upon the process of drafting a new constitution and preparing for democratic elections. The UN Security Council subsequently modified the mission’s mandate: in accordance with Resolution 2376, adopted in September 2017, the mission was tasked with continuing to undertake mediation and `good offices' in the framework of the December 2015 Libyan Political Agreement and to support the governance, security and economic arrangements of the Government of National Accord (GNA, q.v.). Furthermore, UNSMIL was to provide support to key Libyan institutions, to undertake human rights monitoring and reporting, to assist with securing and countering the spread of uncontrolled arms and related materiel, to co-ordinate international assistance, and to assist GNA-led efforts to stabilize post-conflict zones. Through its Security Institutions Division the mission mediates between state and non-state actors, encourages armed groupings to support the political process, and works to bring about ceasefires and humanitarian corridors. With the UN Mine Action Service, UNSMIL has helped to reduce the risks posed by improvised explosive devices.</p>

                    <p usage="edio mena">From July 2014, against a rapidly deteriorating security situation, and discord between rival administrations—i.e. a recently elected House of Representatives which had moved from the Libyan capital Tripoli to the eastern city of Tobruk, and a Tripoli-based pro-Islamist unofficial General National Congress—the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General (SRSG) for Libya mediated intensively with the parties to the conflict. An UNSMIL-facilitated Libyan Political Dialogue was initiated in Geneva, Switzerland, in January 2015. In mid-October, following the finalization by participants in the Dialogue of a political agreement on establishing the GNA, UNSMIL and the United Kingdom authorities jointly convened discussions in London on finding optimum means of supporting the proposed administration. In mid-December representatives of the Tobruk and Tripoli legislatures, meeting in Skhirat, formally adopted the Libyan Political Agreement. The SRSG has co-operated with neighbouring countries (which hold regular collective consultations on the Libyan crisis at ministerial level) and regional and international organizations in support of the implementation of the Agreement.</p>
                    <p usage="edio mena">The 32-member GNA was appointed in mid-January 2016. Later in that month, however, the composition was rejected by the Tobruk legislature. A revised formation, announced in February, was also not formally approved, and on 12 March it was announced that the GNA would take office without formal endorsement. At the end of March the SRSG welcomed the arrival in Tripoli of a nine-member Libyan Presidential Council—provided for under the Agreement—to assume the function of head of state in the transitional regime. UNSMIL thereafter maintained a constant presence in Libya, but in a partial capacity. In July a session of the Libyan Political Dialogue was held to enable consultations between UNSMIL, the Presidential Council, and other stakeholders over means of implementing the Libyan Political Agreement. The July Dialogue determined to convene regular meetings to follow up measures that were being implemented by the Presidential Council to address several crises, including urgent action required to safeguard oil production and exports, and to resolve disruptions to basic services. In August the House of Representatives rejected a proposal by the Prime Minister, Faiez Serraj, on the proposed formation of a new GNA; consequently, the Presidential Council instructed ministers to continue to perform their functions in a caretaker capacity, pending formal approval. In October the SRSG condemned an attempt by opposition elements to take control by force of the headquarters of the High Council of State (a governmental advisory body provided for under the Libya Political Agreement). At the request of the Presidential Council, UNSMIL convened meetings of the Libyan Political Dialogue in September, in Tunis, and in November, in Malta. In December the UN Security Council urged the mission to re-establish in phases—security conditions permitting—a full permanent presence in Libya. In March 2017 an AU-UN-Arab League-EU `Libya Quartet’ formation was established as a collective framework for co-ordinating efforts to address the Libyan crisis. UNSMIL repeatedly urged all armed groups to desist from undermining the formal political process and has expressed strong condemnation of violations of peace and security in Libya.</p>
                    <p usage="edio mena">In December 2016 the UN Secretary-General reported that a military operation undertaken in Libya against Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant-Libya (Islamic State-Libya) during May-November, supported by US air strikes, had retaken nearly the whole of a 300 km stretch of territory around Sirte, and had reduced the militants’ presence in Sirte. Islamic State-Libya continued to operate in remote southern and southwestern areas during 2017-24. Violent conflict escalated in 2017 in southern areas of Libya between the Libyan National Army and the Third Force militant grouping (which originated in the northern city of Misratah). Meanwhile, forces loyal to the Presidential Council extended control of key sites in Tripoli, including the international airport. Together with local authorities UNSMIL worked to develop a security structure for Tripoli. Violent clashes occurred frequently between the Benghazi Defence Brigades rebel militia and the Libyan National Army over control of strategic oil facilities in al-Sidra and Ra's Lanuf. Meanwhile, intercommunal conflict persisted in southern Libya. In mid-May 2018 UNSMIL organized a liaison meeting with armed groups in Misratah, aimed at reducing tensions there and promoting dialogue. In September the UN Envoy to Libya secured a ceasefire between warring militias in Tripoli, following a recent escalation of violent clashes there (as a result of which the Libyan capital had been placed under a state of emergency).</p>
                    <p usage="edio mena">In February 2018 Libya’s Supreme Court dismissed legal challenges to the content of the long-awaited Libyan Draft Constitution (which had been finalized in July 2017), thus enabling the document to be submitted to a future referendum. In February 2019 the SRSG met with Prime Minister Serraj and the Commander of the Libyan National Army, Gen. Khalifa Haftar, to discuss the holding of a general election and measures to maintain stability in the country and to unify its institutions. At the beginning of April the UN Secretary-General expressed deep concern over an ongoing intensification of military activities. On 4 April Gen. Haftar launched an Libyan National Army offensive aimed at seizing Tripoli. Shortly afterwards the SRSG condemned an aerial attack by the Libyan National Army against Tripoli’s only functioning civilian airport (Meitiga Airport), urged the immediate halt to aerial operations, expressed deep concern for the welfare of civilians in the capital, and announced the postponement of a planned Libyan National Conference. From that month Tripoli effectively remained under siege by the Libyan National Army. In early May Premier Serraj declared that he no longer regarded Haftar or Ageela Saleh—the eastern Libyan leader of the House of Representatives, who had sanctioned Haftar’s offensive—as political dialogue partners. At that time 41 members of the legislature declared allegiance to a pro-Serraj manifestation of the House of Representatives. In July the SRSG welcomed successful country-wide elections to the membership of Libya’s Supreme Judicial Council. In the same month, however, he deplored an attack against a migrant detention compound in the coastal city of Tajoura that had resulted in at least 53 fatalities and severe injuries, stating that this might constitute a war crime. He noted that UNSMIL was monitoring with great concern various ongoing allegations of extrajudicial killings. Reporting to the UN Security Council at the end of July the SRSG emphasized that the geographical scope of the ongoing violence had expanded, and that parties to the conflict had ignored calls for de-escalation and had intensified air strikes, including by armed drones. He also noted a trend towards increased recruitment of foreign mercenaries, the impact of aggressive invective spread by social media and satellite television stations, and that both sides had failed to honour their obligations under international law. On 6 January 2020 the Turkish legislature formally authorized the deployment of Turkish troops to defend the GNA.</p>
                    <p usage="edio mena">In early January 2020 the first of a planned series of meetings of Libyan economic experts was convened, representing the initiation of the economic track of a peace proposal (comprising parallel economic, military and political tracks) that had been issued in mid-2019 by the SRSG; a Libyan Expert Economic Commission was formally convened, for this purpose, in February. At an international conference on Libya held (in accordance with the SRSG’s peace plan) in Berlin, Germany, in mid-January 2020—with participation by the UN Secretary-General, the heads of state or of government of Germany, France, Russia, Turkey and the UK, and also by the opposing sides in the Libyan conflict—the foreign leaders pledged not to interfere in Libya's civil war, and adopted a roadmap for future UN-sponsored negotiations aimed at achieving a ceasefire between the opposing militaries.</p>
                    <p usage="edio ewyb mena">The first round of UN-mediated talks was held in February 2020, in Geneva, in the format of a 5+5 Libyan Joint Military Commission (JMC)—comprising five senior military officers representing the GNA and five appointed by the Commander of the Libyan National Army, embodying the first stage of the military track of the SRSG’s peace plan, issued in mid-2019. In mid-February 2020 the UN Security Council adopted a resolution (with Russia abstaining) that restated strong support for UNSMIL, and recognized the significant role of the AU and Arab League in working to resolve the conflict. The resolution emphasized deep concern at the activities of terrorist groups and mercenaries in Libya. It also demanded a ceasefire and an immediate end to the supply of arms to both sides in the conflict. At that time representatives of the Libya Quartet and the foreign ministers of Algeria, China, Egypt, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Turkey, Tunisia, the Republic of the Congo, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the USA launched an International Follow-Up Committee on Libya (IFCL). Regular IFCL meetings were subsequently held, under UN auspices, at senior official and technical working group levels. A draft ceasefire agreement was produced by a second round of 5+5 Libyan JMC negotiations that were facilitated by the SRSG in late February. Negotiations under the political track of the SRSG’s peace plan also commenced in February, in Geneva.</p>
                    <p>During April and May 2020 the mission condemned the continuing escalation of conflict, including indiscriminate bombardment of areas of Tripoli, and acts of retribution in western coastal cities. Opposing parties were urged to refrain from making any provocative statements or actions that might further destabilize Libya; UN member states that were continuing to fuel the conflict by supplying weapons and mercenary fighters were urged to desist; and the whole international community was asked to enforce the Libyan arms embargo. At the beginning of June UNSMIL welcomed a decision by both sides to resume the 5+5 talks. From early June Gen. Haftar’s forces retreated from Tripoli, and GNA forces regained full control of the city. On 20 July the Egyptian legislature authorized the deployment of troops to support Haftar; it was envisaged that this development risked escalating the conflict. However, on 21 August both sides announced a ceasefire.</p>
                    <p usage="edio ewyb mena">In late August 2020 UNSMIL noted an increase in reports of human rights violations across Libya, including arbitrary detentions and restrictions on freedom of movement and assembly. In early September the acting SRSG, Stephanie Williams, welcomed the outcome of recent consultations among Libyan stakeholders, that were held in Montreux, Switzerland, in the presence of representatives of the mission, and provided intra-Libyan proposals to be addressed by a resumed UN-facilitated inclusive Libyan Political Dialogue. On 23 October the acting SRSG welcomed the adoption by the 5+5 JMC delegations—representing the GNA Libyan Army and the Libyan National Army command—of a UN facilitated full, nationwide, permanent and comprehensive ceasefire accord. This also required all foreign troops and mercenaries (including those of the pro-Libyan National Army Russian Wagner Group) to leave Libya before the end of January 2021. On 26 October 2020 the inaugural virtual session was convened of an inclusive Libyan Political Dialogue Forum (LPDF), aimed at achieving consensus on governance arrangements that were to lead to national elections. UNSMIL initiated a website (titled `Al-Hiwar’, i.e. `Dialogue’) to act as an interactive national platform during the LPDF process. The first in-person meeting of the LPDF, organized by UNSMIL (with assistance from UNDP) in mid-November, in Tunis, adopted a political roadmap towards holding presidential and legislative elections on 24 December 2021. In January 2021, following a two-month deadlock, the LPDF eventually agreed a process under which an interim consensual unified executive would be nominated to manage the country pending the scheduled presidential and parliamentary elections. At that time the outgoing acting SRSG alleged that the advancement towards national elections risked being stalled and undermined by a small political class on both sides of Libya’s east-west conflict lines that preferred to preserve a system of patronage that guaranteed its own privilege. In mid-March a newly-appointed Special Envoy, Ján Kubiš, welcomed the inauguration of an interim Government of National Unity (GNU), which had been approved by the House of Representatives earlier in the month. At that time the UN Security Council unanimously called for the withdrawal from Libya without further delay of the continuing presence of foreign forces and mercenaries. The deployment of 60 UN ceasefire monitors to Libya was approved by the Council in April. Addressing a so-called Second Berlin Conference on Libya (`Berlin II’), hosted by the German Government and UN in June, the UN Secretary-General noted that an initial unit of the ceasefire monitors was soon to be deployed to Tripoli, and welcomed a decision by the GNU to create a High National Reconciliation Commission.</p>
                    <p>In late June-early July 2021, at a session of the LPDF that took place in Geneva, the Special Envoy and international partners called on all stakeholders to comply with their responsibilities to facilitate the elections as scheduled by the political roadmap (the 1 July deadline for preparing the constitutional and legislative backing for the polls having been overshot). The Special Envoy welcomed a recent decision by the EU Council to clarify the criteria for imposing sanctions against individuals and entities that were undermining or obstructing the planned Libyan elections. The LPDF session considered a pre-prepared formal bridging proposal aimed at securing the constitutional basis for the planned national elections; meanwhile, three other proposals—not all compliant with the agreed political roadmap—were also submitted by Forum members. A Proposals Bridging Committee was established to seek common ground between the proposals. Following the LPDF session, UNSMIL announced that it would continue to work with the Committee, but that it would not entertain proposals that were not focused on holding the planned elections on 24 December. UNSMIL also welcomed the launch of an updated national voter registration list, and strongly urged the LPDF to accelerate its deliberations. In late August UNSMIL welcomed the creation of a new joint force that had been tasked with securing Libya’s Great Man-Made River fresh water distribution project; the force was deemed to represent significant progress in achieving military unification. In early September UNSMIL demanded an immediate cessation of armed clashes in the Salaheddine area of Tripoli. The mission stated concern in mid-September at the passing by the House of Representatives of a motion of no-confidence motion against the GNU. In November the Special Envoy announced his resignation. The previous acting SRSG was appointed, in December, as the UN Secretary-General’s Special Adviser on Libya; she determined to pursue implementation of the three intra-Libyan dialogue tracks and to support the holding of presidential and parliamentary elections (which, in the absence of an agreed legal framework, were postponed from December). In February 2022 the House of Representatives adopted a constitutional amendment that provided for the establishment of an inclusive constitutional review committee. Deeming the mandate of the GNU and term of Abdul Hamid Dbeibah’s premiership to have expired, the House of Representatives appointed a rival Prime Minister—Fathi Bashagha—in that month.</p>
                    <p>During April-June 2022 three rounds of Libyan constitutional track meetings were held, under UNSMIL auspices, in the Egyptian capital, Cairo. Meetings in the JMC 5+5 format, sponsored by UNSMIL and the UN Secretary-General’s Special Adviser, took place in Cairo in June. In late June the Special Adviser (prior to the termination of her mission on 31 July) mediated a High-Level Meeting, in Geneva, between the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the High Council of State, at which some consensus was achieved with respect to outstanding contentious provisions of the 2017 Libyan Draft Constitution, and a roadmap was adopted on transitional measures that would lead to the holding of national elections. However, differences that remained over the eligibility requirements for presidential candidates were not resolved during further discussions between the heads of the two Libyan chambers that were held in Türkiye at the beginning of August and in Cairo in mid-August. At the beginning of July 2022 the UN Secretary-General stated concern that a series of protests that had erupted across Libya—including in Tripoli, al-Bayda, Benghazi and Tobruk (where the House of Representatives had been stormed)—should be conducted without violence and policed with restraint. An increase in military activity in Tripoli, Misratah and the Sirte area was reported at that time. On 9 August UNSMIL and the JMC met to strengthen the Libyan ceasefire monitoring mechanism, and to finalize modalities for the withdrawal of foreign fighters from the country. Later in that month UNSMIL stated concern over an ongoing mobilization of forces and increase in threats to use military might to secure political gains. The UN Secretary-General expressed concern shortly afterwards over violent clashes that had erupted in Tripoli between armed supporters of Dbeibah and Bashagha, causing 42 fatalities, of whom four were civilians. At the end of August UNSMIL—which has documented disappearances of human rights defenders, elected politicians and political activists, judges, lawyers, migrants and asylum-seekers—urged Libya to adopt the 2010 International Convention for the Protection of all Persons from Enforced Disappearances, and called for the issue to be addressed through a rights-based national reconciliation process. Addressing the UN Security Council on 31 August 2022 the UN Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, Rosemary DiCarlo, stated deep concern at the security threat posed by continuing delays in implementing the electoral process. She called for an end to hate speech and to incitements to violence, and for the immediate release by the Libyan authorities of all arbitrarily detained migrants. A new SRSG for Libya, Abdoulaye Bathily, was appointed at the beginning of September. In December he supported the initiation of a Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework for Libya, which aimed to boost economic growth during 2023-25, and to contribute to an environment conducive to the advancement of human rights and national wellbeing.</p>
                    <p>In January 2023 UNSMIL urged the prompt adoption of timebound arrangements to enable free and fair national elections to be organized during the year ahead. UNSMIL hosted a meeting in March of the 5+5 JMC, with military commanders of security units in the east and west of the country, which aimed to foster national reconciliation and enhance the electoral preparations. During that month the UN Security Council welcomed Egypt’s mediatory role in arranging talks (in Cairo) between the rival House of Representatives and High Council of State. The Council commended extensive consultations undertaken by the SRSG with Libyan and regional stakeholders, and the international community, in pursuit of a consensus-based route towards national elections, and welcomed his initiative to launch a Libyan High-Level Panel for Elections. A 6+6 joint High Council of State-House of Representatives Committee was established in that month, tasked with finalizing electoral laws; UNSMIL subsequently undertook technical reviews of draft legislation, and continued to provide technical support to Libya’s High National Elections Commission. In May the House of Representatives suspended Bashagha; Osama Hamada was appointed as acting (rival) Prime Minister. In May-June UNSMIL participated in a series of meetings with political organizations and other stakeholders to review new draft election legislation, and extended advice on electoral, constitutional and gender dimensions. The mission urged greater engagement with the elections preparations process from a broad range of Libyan stakeholders and institutions. UNSMIL issued a statement in July that stated great concern over continued abductions, forced disappearances and arbitrary arrests perpetrated by various security actors in Libya against citizens and public figures (including the brief detention in mid-July of a Libyan former minister of finance). In early August Mohammed Takala was elected President of the High Council of State. UNSMIL welcomed the reunification in August of the Central Bank of Libya. Eastern Libya was struck by very severe flooding in the following month. Meeting in March 2024, in Cairo, under Arab League auspices, the heads of Libya’s Presidential Council, High Council of State and the Speaker of the House of Representatives agreed on the need to hold national elections, and decided to form a technical committee to address outstanding controversial issues. The SRSG continued in early 2024 to engage with relevant regional and international actors, and to mobilize support for the Libyan political process. In mid-April he announced his intention to resign his position, given the lack of political will for the electoral process and national reconciliation.</p>

                    <heading>Establishment and Mandate</heading>
                    <p>The Verification Mission, mandated to support the peace process in Colombia, was established in September 2017, in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 2366, adopted in July. It succeeded the former UN Mission in Colombia, which was established in January 2016 by UN Security Council Resolution 2261, at the joint request of the Colombian Government and the rebel Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia—Ejército del Pueblo (FARC-EP). The Verification Mission was to act as the international component and co-ordinator of a tripartite (i.e. Government of Colombia/FARC-EP/UN) Monitoring and Verification Mechanism, with a primary focus on verifying the social, political and economic reintegration of former combatants; collective and personal security guarantees; and programmes on security and protection measures in conflict-affected areas. The mission was to maintain 10 regional offices and seven sub-offices, and a presence in 24 `former territorial areas for training and reintegration’, where former combatants were to be assisted to reintegrate into society. In October 2017 the Security Council expanded the mandate of the mission to include monitoring a temporary bilateral ceasefire between the Colombian Government and the rebel grouping Ejército de Liberación Nacional (ELN), which had entered into effect on 1 October. In May 2021 the Security Council expanded the mission’s mandate to include monitoring implementation of sentences to be issued by a Special Jurisdiction for Peace, which was established under the 2016 Final Agreement to investigate and prosecute those responsible for the most serious human rights violations committed during the civil conflict. In August 2023 the Security Council authorized the mission to monitor and verify implementation of a new ceasefire accord reached between the Government and the ELN. It also authorized the deployment of up to an additional 68 international observers. In October the UN Security Council extended the mission’s mandate until 31 October 2024.</p>

                    <heading>Activities</heading>
                    <p usage="sacac edio">Establishing the preceding UN Mission in Colombia in late January 2016, the UN Security Council expressed its full commitment to the General Agreement to End the Conflict and Build a Stable and Lasting Peace that had been concluded in August 2012, in Havana, Cuba, by the Colombian authorities and FARC-EP. In February 2016 a multi-partner peacebuilding trust fund was established, which was to be managed jointly by the UN and the Colombian Government, and was to have a particular focus on supporting former conflict areas. In June, in Havana, the Colombian authorities and FARC-EP agreed to a formal cessation of hostilities and to the disarmament of FARC-EP. An advance team of mission observers was deployed in July, tasked with undertaking preparatory activities. A Final Agreement for Ending the Conflict and Building a Stable and Lasting Peace was concluded by the Colombian Government and FARC-EP, in Havana, in late August, and was formally signed, in Cartagena, Colombia, in September. At the end of September mission observers, nine representatives of the Colombian Government, and nine representatives of FARC-EP began to operationalize the Monitoring and Verification Mechanism. On 2 October, however, the provisions of the peace agreement were narrowly rejected by the electorate at a national referendum, and the Mechanism’s activities were temporarily suspended. None the less, the Government and FARC-EP reiterated their commitment to the ceasefire and cessation of hostilities, and the mission’s head supported and participated in a continuation of the negotiations process. In mid-October a new ceasefire protocol was concluded between parties to the conflict, and later in that month the UN Secretary-General requested the Security Council to authorize the mission to verify its implementation, pending the conclusion of a new final peace agreement. The tripartite Monitoring and Verification Mechanism officially resumed operations on 7 November. A few days later the Colombian and FARC-EP leaders announced the conclusion of a revised Final Agreement, and, following the signing of this later in that month, in Bogotá, and its subsequent ratification, it entered into force in December. A Commission for the Follow-up, Promotion and Verification of the Implementation of the Final Agreement, a National Reintegration Council, and a Colombian National Commission on Security Guarantees were to maintain a dialogue with the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General (SRSG) and with the Monitoring and Verification Mission. During March-June 2017 mission observers undertook the process of verifying the disarmament of former militants at FARC-EP camps (this was formally completed on 27 June). By mid-August more than 8,100 weapons and more than 1.3m. incinerated cartridges had been removed from FARC-EP camps and arms caches and placed in storage. Unstable explosives found at the camps, such as grenades and anti-personnel mines, had been destroyed. FARC-EP formally transformed into a political party at the end of August.</p>
                    <p usage="edio sacac">In January 2018 the UN Secretary-General urged the Colombian Government and ELN to resume efforts to agree a stronger ceasefire, and tasked the SRSG with taking action to facilitate the resumption of bilateral negotiations between the two sides (which had been suspended in that month). The talks were resumed in March. On 31 July the SRSG met with representatives of both sides and endorsed their political declaration of a commitment to further dialogue, despite no agreements on social participation or on a ceasefire being reached at that time. In August, however, following the inauguration of the new Colombian President Iván Duque (elected in May-June) the Government halted the negotiations process with the ELN pending that grouping’s rejection of all criminal activities, including hostage taking and attacks against strategic oil pipelines. The ELN, in turn, indicated that it would only end such attacks if the Colombian military committed to a full bilateral ceasefire and ceased the pursuit of ELN combatants.</p>
                    <p usage="edio sacac">In July 2018 the UN Secretary-General reported that the mission, the Colombian authorities and FARC-EP had identified a series of measures aimed at advancing the implementation of the reintegration process for former combatants, and at enhancing security guarantees for the most conflict-affected local areas. He also noted a presidential decree issued in early May aimed at enabling access to land ownership for co-operatives of former combatants. In early July the mission celebrated the inaugural session of a new Congress, incorporating for the first time FARC-EP political representatives, further to legislative elections held in March. It was reported in September that, in contravention of the 2016 Final Agreement, several FARC-EP leaders had abandoned their territorial areas for training and reintegration in which they had been positioned. In late August 2019 the mission strongly condemned the decision by an FARC-EP faction to renounce the 2016 Agreement and to re-arm.</p>
                    <p usage="sacac">The UN Secretary-General reported in June 2020 that the implementation during that year of a mandatory COVID-19 lockdown and other containment measures had adversely affected some security guarantee mechanisms provided for under the Final Agreement, enabling illegal armed groupings and criminal entities to intensify their strategic presence and also to strengthen their control over strategic illicit trafficking routes.</p>
                    <p usage="edio sacac">In December 2021 the UN Secretary-General reported that violence by illegal armed actors in competition for territorial and social control was continuing, leading to large-scale killings and forced mass displacements. Many of the co-operating ex-combatants were reported to be at heightened risk of attacks, forced re-recruitment into militant groupings, and reprisals.Meeting in January and July 2022 the UN Security Council stated concern over continuing threats and assaults against and murders of former FARC-EP combatants who were participating in the peace process, as well as abuses and murders of community leaders. In June the Secretary-General acknowledged the democratic progress made by the country with the recent peaceful conduct of elections. He also welcomed the publication of the final report of the country’s Truth Commission. In late June a hearing was organized for the first case (`01’, involving seven former FARC-EP commanders) that was being addressed by the Special Jurisdiction for Peace, which had been established under the 2016 Final Agreement to ensure accountability for the most serious human rights violations committed during the civil conflict.</p>
                    <p>Upon taking office in August 2022, the new Colombian President Gustavo Petro pursued a policy aimed at achieving `Paz Total’ (Total Peace), which included a focus on dialogue with armed groups. In January 2023, at the request of the Colombian Government, the UN Security Council expanded UNVMC’s mandate to encompass monitoring the implementation of the chapters of the Final Peace Agreement that relate to comprehensive rural reform (progress had been made by the Petro administration in purchasing land and formalizing land tenure to provide stability for landless peasant farmers) and ethnic matters (with a focus on Indigenous and Afro-Colombians). A ceasefire between government forces and the dissident former FARC-EP faction Estado Mayor Central (EMC) was implemented from January; in May, however, the truce was suspended. In June, during a round of peace talks held in Cuba, the Colombian Government and the ELN concluded agreements that provided for a potentially renewable 180-day national bilateral ceasefire, to take effect on 3 August, and for the establishment of a mechanism to define social participation in the national peace process. On 2 August the Security Council expanded UNVMC’s mandate to monitor and verify the implementation of the ceasefire; subsequently 60 new observers and 46 new civilian staff were appointed to the mission. In February 2024 the ceasefire was extended for a further six-month period. In mid-October 2023 a renewed Government-EMC ceasefire entered into force; this was partially suspended in March 2024.</p>
                    <p>In late December 2023 the UN Secretary-General reported that, with regard to integration, nearly 80% of the more than 13,000 accredited former FARC-EP members were participating in 5,691 productive initiatives. By that time 406 targeted killings and 136 attempted murders of former FARC-EP combatants had been verified by the mission since the adoption of the Final Agreement. Furthermore, 35 former combatants were recorded as missing. Human rights defenders and social leaders were also under very significant threat; 13 killings of social leaders were verified during the period 27 September-26 December 2023.</p>
