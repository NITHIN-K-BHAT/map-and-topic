        UNIDIR was established by the UN General Assembly in 1980 to undertake independent research on, and develop solutions to disarmament and related problems, particularly international security issues. UNIDIR's statute as an autonomous institution within the UN became effective on 1 January 1985. The UN Secretary-General's Advis­ory Board on Disarmament Studies functions as UNIDIR's Board of Trustees. The Director of UNIDIR reports annually to the General Assembly on the activities of the Institute—which are implemented in the framework of the UN’s 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-UNDP.001">2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development</xr>
        , and of Securing our Common Future, an agenda presented by the UN Secretary-General in May 2018 for advancing practical disarmament measures that cover weapons of mass destruction (WMD), conventional arms and also future weapon technologies. Other work programmes cover space security, gender and disarmament, the proposed establishment of a Middle East Weapons of Mass Destruction Free Zone (ME WMDFZ), and managing exits from armed conflict. 
      </p>
               <p>The Institute maintains an online Gender and Disarmament Hub, an ME WMDFZ Hub, the UNIDIR Artificial Intelligence Policy Portal, a Cyber Policy Portal and accompanying database, a Space Security Portal, and a Biological Weapons Convention National Implementation Measures Database. The Institute organizes conferences, workshops and seminars on a range of issues, including on cyber stability and on small arms and light weapons. Research projects are conducted within the Institute, or commissioned to experts or research organizations. The Institute offers a research fellowship programme focusing on topics relating to regional security. The UNIDIR Academy provides disarmament-related courses. A UNIDIR-UNITAR Summer Course in Security and Technology was initiated in September 2022. The UNIDIR Futures Lab organizes long-term research on global security dynamics.</p>
               <p usage="edio">An ECOWAS-UNIDIR Regional Seminar on Disarmament is organized annually. The inaugural session was convened in February 2023, in Geneva, of a UNIDIR-Women In International Security (WIIS) CoLab, promoting dialogue and linkages between locally-based women engaged in international security and disarmament.</p>

               <p id="IO-UN.1689">UNITAR was established in 1963, as an autonomous body within the UN, to provide training for diplomats and other officials, and to enhance the UN system’s effectiveness. UNITAR's training activities include seminars, workshops, Master’s programmes, fellowships, and distance and online learning. Engagement with more vulnerable societies, for example Least Developed Countries, small island developing states and conflict-affected areas, is particularly promoted. UNITAR has offices in New York, USA, Hiroshima, Japan, and Bonn, Germany, to provide specialist or regional training activities, a local project office in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, and a global network of 29 so-called CIFAL training centres. UNITAR hosts the secretariat of the global Defeat-NCD Partnership (focused on building capacity to combat non-communicable diseases).</p>

         and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): peace, people, planet and prosperity, as well as on accelerating the achievement of the SDGs, strengthening multilateral diplomacy, and implementing the UNITAR Operational Satellite Applications Programme (UNOSAT). In addition to core diplomatic training, the Institute's Masters courses in 2024 covered, 
        <i>inter alia,</i>
         Conflict, Peace and Security; Disaster Resilience and Sustainable Development; Electoral Policy and Administration; Global Health Procurement and Supply Chain Management; Global Sustainable Development; Humanitarian Action and Peacebuilding; Migration Studies; Public International Law; Sustainable Air Transport Management; and (jointly with UPEACE) Gender and Development.

        UNOSAT aims to ensure that information (high resolution imagery) from satellite Earth observation is available and used effectively by relief and development organizations, as well as to help to monitor human rights and security and to support territorial planning. UNOSAT’s humanitarian rapid mapping service provides rapid acquisition and processing of satellite imagery for use by agencies co-ordinating emergency relief, as well as recovery and rehabilitation efforts. There are UNITAR-UNOSAT offices in Bangkok, Thailand, and in Nairobi, Kenya. In early 2024 UNOSAT assessed, 
        <i>inter alia,</i>
         impacts of a storm surge and flash flooding in the Marshall Islands, and of Israel’s military operation against the Gaza Strip (in February UNOSAT reported that around 30% of structures in Gaza had been damaged since the devastating escalation in October 2023 of the Hamas-Israel conflict).

               <p id="UNICRI.IO.11">UNICRI was established in 1968 as the UN Social Defence Research Institute. Its present name was adopted in 1989. The Institute aims to identify strategies for the prevention and control of crime, and undertakes research, training and capacity-building activities in those fields. UNICRI maintains liaison offices in Rome, Italy and New York, USA; an office in Geneva, Switzerland; and a Centre for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Robotics in The Hague, Netherlands.</p>
               <p>
        UNICRI’s activities are underpinned by Sustainable Development Goal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all, and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels. The Institute’s objectives include advancing the understanding of crime-related problems; fostering just and efficient criminal justice systems; facilitating international law enforcement co-operation and judicial assistance; and supporting respect of international instruments and other standards. UNICRI’s strategic programme framework for the period 2023-26 identified as principal strategic priorities: Promoting rule of law and safeguarding access to justice; Preventing and countering transnational security threats, terrorism and points of nexus; Countering criminal enterprises, illicit financial flows and corrupt practices; Promoting responsible use of new and emerging technologies to combat crime and exploitation; and Preventing and countering violent extremism and radicalization. Gender, climate change and youth were cross-cutting themes. The framework was aligned to

        UNICRI is a signatory of the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Coordination Compact, and supports the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (adopted in 2006). Since 2010 UNICRI has worked with the European Union to implement a global CBRN Risk Mitigation Centres of Excellence initiative, focused on chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) risk reduction and preparedness. In May 2022 UNICRI published a

It aims to provide governments, development agencies, grass-roots organizations and academics with a better understanding of how development policies and processes of economic, social and environmental change impact different social groups. It also aims to promote and strengthen research capacities in developing countries. The UNRISD Office in Bonn, Germany, was established in February 2020 to facilitate collaborations with other agencies and research bodies.</p>
               <p>UNRISD research is undertaken in collaboration with a network of national research teams drawn from local universities and research institutions. The main programme areas of its research strategy for the period 2021-25 were: Transformative social policy; Gender justice and development; Alternative economies fortransformation; Environmental and climate justice; and Translating research into policy and practice (led by the UNRISD Office in Bonn, and also referred to as `the Bonn Programme’). An UNRISD-Green Economy Coalition project to develop a Global Research and Action Network for a New Eco-Social Contract was underway during 2021-25. In November 2022 UNRISD issued a user manual focused on 61 performance indicators measuring progress in achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>
               <p>In September 2013 UNRISD, the International Labour Organization and UN Development Programme established a UN Inter-Agency Task Force on Social and Solidarity Economy.
