          <p>UN Women supports deliberations on international policy, standards and norms by UN member states in intergovernmental bodies, in particular the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW). It also co-ordinates UN system-wide efforts to achieve gender equality, and assists countries with putting international standards into practice through national strategies or legislation. In all areas of activity UN Women aims to promote implementation of internationally agreed standards as incorporated, for example, in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW, 1979); the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development (1994), which recognized that reproductive rights and health, women's empowerment, and gender equality, should underpin population and development programming; the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (approved at the Fourth World Conference on Women, held in 1995); and UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.</p>
          <p>The core areas of activity of UN Women are identified as contributing to the achievement of the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development; Governance and National Planning; Ending Violence against Women; Peace and Security; Women’s Leadership and Political Participation; Economic Empowerment; Humanitarian Action; Youth; Women and Girls with Disabilities; and HIV/AIDS. The organization works with national partners, regional organizations and UN country teams to extend the necessary expert technical, practical and advocacy assistance to further gender equality efforts. Civil society organizations are actively encouraged to collaborate with UN Women.</p>
          <p>In May 2012 UN Women launched a Global Civil Society Advisory Group, comprising advocates for women’s rights and experts on gender issues, which was tasked with facilitating UN Women-civil society dialogue. UN Women manages the Focal Point for Women in the UN System, which monitors the status of women across the broader organization. The Entity promotes gender mainstreaming, i.e. assessing the potential implications for women and men of all planned policies, programmes and legislation.</p>
          <p>In September 2020 UN Women and the UN Development Programme (UNDP) jointly launched a COVID-19 Global Gender Response Tracker, to monitor gender disparities in countries’ COVID-19 response programming, with a focus on women’s economic and social security, unpaid care work, the labour market and prevention of violence against women.</p>
          <p>UN Women issued a statement in September 2022 that expressed deep concern over the recent death in state custody in Iran of a young woman, Mahsa Amini, who had reportedly been detained for non-observance of a strict national dress code for women. Shortly afterwards, as related protests mounted in Iran, UN Women issued a further statement that supported demands by women in that country to be free to protest injustice without reprisals and free to exercise bodily autonomy (including with respect to choice of attire). In December UN Women’s Executive Director protested decrees recently issued by the Taliban regime in Afghanistan that prevented girls from attending secondary schools, ordered the closure until further notice of women’s universities, and prohibited women from working in non-governmental organizations (NGOs). In January 2023 the Executive Director participated in a visit to Afghanistan by a high-level UN delegation led by the UN Deputy Secretary-General, Amina Mohammed. The UN delegation urged the Taliban authorities to reverse all limitations placed on the rights of women and girls.</p>
          <p>CSW67, held at UN headquarters in March 2023, addressed the priority theme `Innovation and technological change, and education in the digital age for achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls’, and also reviewed `Challenges and opportunities in achieving gender equality and the empowerment of rural women and girls’.</p>
          <p>International Women’s Day is celebrated annually on 8 March (in 2023 this was focused on the theme `DigitALL: Innovation and technology for gender equality’). Furthermore, International Day of Women and Girls in Science is observed on 11 February, and International Day of the Girl Child is commemorated on 11 October.</p>

               <p>SDG 5 comprises the following targets, to be achieved by 2030: End all forms of discrimination against all women and girls everywhere; Eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres, including trafficking and sexual and other types of exploitation; Eliminate all harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation; Recognize and value unpaid care and domestic work through the provision of public services, infrastructure and social protection policies and the promotion of shared responsibility; Ensure women’s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision making in political, economic and public life; Ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights; Undertake reforms to give women equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to ownership and control over land and other forms of property, financial services, inheritance and natural resources; Enhance the use of enabling technology, in particular information and communications technology, to promote the empowerment of women; Adopt and strengthen sound policies and enforceable legislation for the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls at all levels.</p>

               <heading>Global Acceleration Plan (GAP) for Gender Equality</heading>
               <p>In May 2019 UN Women launched a Generation Equality initiative as a framework for actions aimed at promoting gender parity. In 2021 UN Women helped to stage a Generation Equality Forum that was organized (partly online) in two sections: the first was hosted from Mexico City, Mexico, in March, and the second from Paris, France, in late June-early July. The Paris phase of the Forum launched the GAP, which was framed around six new multi-stakeholder Action Coalitions, covering: gender-based violence, economic justice and rights, bodily autonomy and sexual and reproductive health rights, technology and innovation, feminist action for climate justice, and feminist movements and leadership. These were to mobilize civil society, governments, private sector interests and international organizations to advance equality during the period 2021-26. A Compact on Women, Peace and Security and Humanitarian Action, and a Generation Equality Youth Task Force were to support the movement. Some US&#8201;$40,000m. in new donor funding was committed at that time to support the implementation of the GAP. A Generation Equality Accountability Platform was initiated in September 2022.</p>

        UN Women advocates for provisions on gender equality to be integrated into national and local policies, plans, budgets and statistical data, for gender equality to be a priority in channelling development assistance, and for sufficient and transparent funding to be directed to these ends. The UN Entity has compiled a

               <p>In September 2016 UN Women launched a flagship initiative, `Making Every Woman and Girl Count’, supported by a public-private partnership, which aims to advance the use of quality data and statistics relating to gender equality and women's empowerment. A Women Count Data Hub, initiated by UN Women in September 2019, provides public access to gender data and to reports and analysis relating to the lives of women and girls, with a view to supporting and monitoring relevant progress towards achieving the SDGs.</p>
               <p usage="edio">In August 2019 UN Women supported the establishment of a Biarritz Partnership on gender equality at a summit meeting of the Group of Seven industrialized economies. This was to focus on reducing gender-based violence, widening access to high-quality health and education, enhancing economic empowerment, and on ending gender discrimination in policymaking and in public life while ensuring the high-level participation of women.</p>

        A report, 
        <publ-name>Gender Equality: Women’s Rights in Review</publ-name>
        , that was issued at the 64th session of the CSW, held in March 2020, found, 
        <i>inter alia,</i>
         that in the 25 years since 1995 nearly 80 countries had legislated for gender quotas aimed at increasing female participation in electoral systems; 155 member states had strengthened legislation to combat violence against women; a trend towards a decline in teenage pregnancy was occurring in countries where young women tended to have a strong sense of their rights; and by 2015 94 states offered paternity leave frameworks (compared with only one, Sweden, in 1995).
      </p>
               <p>In June 2023 UN Women and other agencies helped to organize a Global Summit on Gender Equality in Nationality Laws, focused on ending gender discriminatory rules that continued to deny women the right to pass down their citizenship to their children (in 24 states), or to deny women the right to confer their nationality to a spouse on an equal footing with men (in 50 states).</p>

               <p>UN Women advocates for strengthening legislation and the implementation of legislation aimed at preventing violence against women, including physical, sexual, psychological and economic abuses of power. UN Women works to combat the organized trafficking of females; child marriage; female genital mutilation/cutting; and the use of rape as a weapon of warfare. In March 2013 participants in the 57th session of the CSW adopted a landmark set of `Agreed Conclusions' that condemned pervasive violence against women and girls, pledged to end impunity and to improve evidence collection and victim response mechanisms; and proposed the establishment of multisectoral services for female survivors of violence, including in the areas of provision of health and psychological support services, and protection of the right to sexual and reproductive health.</p>
               <p>The UN Women’s Trust Fund to End Violence Against Women, established in 1997, awards grants to projects that aim to address, reduce and eliminate violence against women. In 2020 the Fund managed 150 projects in 71 countries and territories, in which it had invested some US&#8201;$72.8m. In March 2022 the Fund launched an online global knowledge exchange resource, SHINE, focused on ending violence against women.</p>
               <p>A joint UN-EU `Spotlight Initiative’ aimed at eliminating violence against women and girls, to be supported by a dedicated multi-donor trust fund, was launched in September 2017. In September, at a meeting on the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse that was convened on the sidelines of the commencement of the 72nd session of the UN General Assembly, the UN Secretary-General introduced a voluntary compact aimed at preventing sexual exploitation and abuse. UN Women’s Safe Cities and Safe Public Spaces initiative (launched in 2010 as the Global Safe Cities Free of Violence against Women and Girls Global Programme), addresses safety from sexual intimidation in public spaces.</p>
               <p>
        UN Women supports a public campaign, (`Say NO—UNiTE'), which was launched in 2008 by the UN Secretary-General to end violence against women. The UN Entity maintains the Virtual Knowledge Centre to End Violence against Women and Girls (accessible at www.endvawnow.org), envisaged as a global one-stop resource for formulating and implementing anti-violence programmes. Each year UN Women supports a global public awareness campaign, 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence (GBV)
        
        , which begins on the International Day to End Violence against Women (25 November).

               <p>
        In April 2020 UN Women issued recommendations aimed at preventing and efficiently responding to the `shadow pandemic’ of violence against women and girls in the context of COVID-19 domestic lockdowns. In November 2021 the Entity issued a report, 
        <publ-name>Measuring the shadow pandemic: Violence against women during COVID-19,</publ-name>
         which retrospectively took stock of impacts of the home confinement mandates during the peak of the global health crisis, using data from,

         emergency hotlines, police records, social media postings, and internet searches from that time.

               <p>UN Women estimates that civilians and in particular women and children represent up to 90% of casualties in conflict situations. Women and girls in such situations are adversely affected by the devastation of local infrastructures, and may also be subjected to sexual violence, which is sometimes deployed systematically. The impact of conflict and sexual violence can, in turn, prevent women and girls from accessing education and attaining economic independence or participation in governance and peacebuilding activities.</p>
               <p>UN Women has played a leading role in the development of an inter-agency framework for implementing and monitoring UN Security Council Resolution 1325 (adopted in October 2000), which reaffirmed the importance of the role of women in conflict prevention and resolution, peace negotiations, peacekeeping, peacebuilding, humanitarian response and post-conflict reconstruction, and emphasized the need for their equal participation in all efforts aimed at the maintenance and promotion of peace and security. It also urged the incorporation of gender perspectives, and more appointments of women, in all UN peace and security efforts, and for all parties to armed conflict to implement special measures to protect women and girls from GBV. Resolution 1325 is complemented by further resolutions of the Security Council, including Resolution 1820 (adopted in June 2008), urging the cessation of conflict-related sexual violence and of related impunity; Resolution 1888 (September 2009), with a focus on building the UN and member states’ leadership and other institutional capacities to end conflict-related sexual violence; Resolution 1960 (December 2010), mandating the UN Secretary-General to establish arrangements for monitoring sexual violence in conflict situations and to list parties suspected of complicity in such violence; and Resolution 2122 (October 2013), in which the Security Council requested the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations and Department of Political Affairs systematically to include in their reports to the Council information and related recommendations on issues of relevance to Women, Peace and Security, and requested all UN-established commissions of inquiry investigating situations on the Council’s agenda to include in their briefings information on the differentiated impacts of armed conflict on women and girls. A High-level Review Conference on the implementation of Resolution 1325 was held in October 2015.</p>
               <p>In September 2016 UN Women, the CEDAW Committee, the Committee on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families, and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights issued a joint statement addressing gender dimensions in large-scale movements of refugees and migrants. This urged respect for relevant core international legislation, and urged states to recognize the socioeconomic contribution of migrant women and girls to their countries of origin, transit and destination. </p>
               <p>The Entity works to increase the inclusion of women and gender perspectives in post-conflict and humanitarian planning. In February 2016 a multi-partner Global Acceleration Instrument for Women, Peace and Security and Humanitarian Action was launched by UN member states and civil society groups, to direct resources to women’s civil society groupings engaged in conflict prevention, resolution and recovery.</p>
               <p>In March 2022 UN Women and UNDP jointly launched a new Gender Justice Platform, with the aim of facilitating access to justice for sexual and gender-based violence survivors in 14 conflict and peacebuilding contexts in Africa and the Middle East.</p>

        UN Women supports national efforts to advance women’s political leadership and participation in executive government, national legislatures and local government. It promotes constitutional reforms and special temporary measures to expand the number of women in political positions. It assists women in acquiring the skills needed to be effective politicians, and by ensuring that election management bodies respond to women’s specific concerns. UN Women maintains a Global Gender Equality Constitutional Database, which collates, from a gender perspective, provisions from 194 national constitutions. The Entity supports the International Knowledge Network of Women in Politics (iKNOW Politics), an online resource on female political participation, that was launched in 2007 collectively with the

               <p>In September 2022 UN Women helped to organize the inaugural meeting of a new UN General Assembly Platform of Women Leaders. The Platform, gathering women heads of state and of government from around the world, addressed the theme `Transformative solutions by women leaders to today’s interlinked challenges’. UN Women reported in October 2022 that since 1948 only 8% of Permanent Representatives to the UN had been women, and that one-third of these had been appointed in the preceding four years.</p>

The Entity supports countries with enacting legislation and implementing policies aimed at increasing women’s access to economic resources, and at establishing services that support sustainable livelihoods. UN Women works to strengthen women’s rights to inheritance and land, to increase their access to decent work and to credit, and also to support the empowerment of female migrant workers. In March 2017 the CSW agreed a roadmap aimed at achieving the full and equal participation of women in the economy, and outlining existing barriers to this, including unequal working conditions, the over-representation of women in the informal economy, and social norms and gender stereotypes that link women to particular economic sectors (such as the health and social sectors). A global Platform on Gender Equality and Religion was also launched at that time, with the aim of promoting co-operation between gender equality activists and faith-based partners.</p>

By 2023 it was a global network of more than 100 governmental, public and private sector partners working to achieve digital gender equality. In September 2017 UN Women, jointly with partners from NGOs, the private sector and academia, initiated a Global Innovation Coalition for Change (GICC), which aims to encourage women and girls to benefit from the opportunities presented by innovation and technology. The GICC leads five initiatives: the Gender Innovation Principles (establishing a set of standards for businesses relating to women’s participation in innovation); the She Innovates Global Programme (which supports women innovators, including through a She Innovates Lab); a She Innovates Campaign and Mentoring Programme; Champions for Innovation; and the 4Good Programme South Africa (which supports innovation in South Africa).
