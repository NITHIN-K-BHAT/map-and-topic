      UN member states pay mandatory assessed contributions towards the regular budget, towards 
      <xr pageref="N" ref="INT-ORG_UN-PEACE.1">peacekeeping operations</xr>
      , to international tribunals, and to the Capital Master Plan (which manages renovation works at UN headquarters in New York, USA). Ability to pay assessed contributions to the regular budget is determined by a 10-year average of national gross domestic product figures, adjusted to take into account high levels of foreign debt or very low per caput income (the minimum assessment is 0.001% of the budget). From 2001 the upper level of contributions to the UN’s regular budget was capped at 22.0%. In accordance with a new scale of assessments calculation that was adopted in December 2021, the three largest contributors to the regular budget in 2022-24 were the USA (22%), the People’s Republic of China (15%), and Japan (8%). The Holy See and Palestine (non-member states that participate in UN activities) also pay annual contributions, with assessments in 2022-24 of 0.001% and 0.011%, respectively.

          <p usage="ewyb edio">In December 2022 the General Assembly endorsed a permanent annual budgetary cycle. The regular programme budget for 2024, approved in December 2023, totalled US&#8201;$3,588.4m. A longstanding pattern of budget deficits has become critical in recent years. By May 2024 108 countries had paid their full 2024 assessments.</p>
          <p id="IO-UN.329" usage="edio">In 1997 a US business executive and philanthropist, Ted Turner, announced a donation of US $1,000m. to finance UN humanitarian and environmental causes. Paid in instalments from 1997, the donation was administered through Turner’s `UN Foundation'. The Foundation, also sustained by resources from other donors (with total resources since its inception having exceeded $2,000m. as at 2024), supports the UN through advocacy, grant-making, and the implementation of public-private partnerships. In December 1997 a UN Development Account was established to finance capacity development projects, and in July 2005 a UN Democracy Fund was created to support democratic institutions, participation in the democratic process, and human rights. A UN Office for Partnerships was established in 2006 to co-ordinate the UN Fund for International Partnerships and the UN Democracy Fund.</p>
