                         <p id="IO-UN.533">The Court is composed of 15 judges, each of a different nationality, elected with an absolute majority by both the General Assembly and the Security Council. Representation of different legal systems of the world are borne in mind in their election. Candidates are nominated by national panels of jurists.</p>
                         <p id="IO-UN.534">The judges are elected for nine years and may be re-elected; elections for five seats are held every three years. The Court elects its President and Vice-President for each three-year period. Members may not have any political, administrative, or other professional occupation, and may not sit in any case with which they have been otherwise connected than as a judge of the Court. For the purposes of a case, each sideâconsisting of one or more statesâmay, unless the Bench already includes a judge with a corresponding nationality, choose a person from outside the Court to sit as a judge on terms of equality with the members. Judicial decisions are taken by a majority of the judges present, subject to a quorum of nine members. The President has a casting vote.</p>

                              <p>In March 2023 the Court delivered an initial Judgment on the merits of the case brought by Iran against the USA concerning `certain Iranian assetsâ, finding that the USA had illegally permitted courts to freeze the assets of some sanctioned Iranian companies, and ordering the USA to pay compensation in this respect. In the following month the Court issued a Judgment on a preliminary objection raised by Venezuela in the case concerning the Arbitral Award of 3 October 1899 (Guyana v. Venezuela). A further Judgment was delivered in July on the case brought by Nicaragua against Colombia concerning the delimitation of the continental shelf between the two countries (initial judgment having been delivered in March 2016). In January 2024 the Court issued a Judgment in a case brought by Ukraine against the Russian Federation in 2017 concerning alleged violations of the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism (1999) and of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (1965), which acquitted Russia of having financed terrorism in eastern Ukraine; however, Russia was found to have violated the latter Convention with regard to the way that it had implemented Ukrainian-language school education in Crimea post-2014.</p>

                              <p>On 26 January 2024 the Court declined a request by Israel that it remove the case brought against it by South Africa from the General List. It also determined that there was a plausible link to a requirement for the protection of the rights of the Palestinians under the Convention and an urgent need to adopt provisional measures to protect against `severe and irreparable harmâ to those rights. Accordingly, the Court issued a legally-binding order on provisional measures, including that Israel take, with immediate effect, all measures within its power to ensure that its forces did not commit any of the inhumane acts covered by the Convention. The measures also required Israel to enable the provision of basic services and humanitarian assistance to the Palestinians and to report on measures taken. On 28 March (by which time famine was reported to be emerging in Gaza) the Court ordered Israel to ensure the unhindered provision at scale of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance, as well as medical supplies and medical care, to Palestinians throughout Gazaâincluding by expanding the number and capacity of land crossing points and maintaining them open for as long as necessary. Israel was also ordered to ensure with immediate effect that its military did not commit acts that constitute a violation of any of the rights of Palestinians in Gaza (including by preventingâthrough any actionâthe delivery of urgently needed humanitarian assistance). On 24 Mayâin view of an Israeli order issued on 6 May that demanded the evacuation of the eastern portion of Rafah, and the initiation of an Israeli military offensive against that governorate (which, as it intensified, prompted further Israeli evacuation demands)âthe Court delivered a further order. This reaffirmed the provisional measures indicated in the orders of 26 January and 28 March, and indicated the following further provisional measures: Israel was to immediately to halt its military offensive, and any other action in Rafah which might `inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in partâ; to maintain open the Rafah crossing (at Gazaâs border with Egypt) for unimpeded humanitarian deliveries at scale; and to take effective measures to ensure the unrestricted access to Gaza of any mission mandated by the UN to investigate allegations of genocide.</p>
