          The Council is organized to be able to function continuously. Its Presidency rotates between the member states on a monthly basis, in English alphabetical order. Each member of the Council has one vote. On procedural matters decisions are made by the affirmative vote of any nine members. For decisions on other matters the required nine votes must include the votes of the five permanent members. This is the rule of `great power unanimity', popularly known as the veto privilege. In practice, an abstention by one of the permanent members is not regarded as a veto. Between 1946 and May 2024, 158 draft resolutions were vetoed by the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and its successor, from 1991, Russia, 92 by the USA, 32 by the UK, 21 by China, and 18 by France. In April 2022 the UN General Assembly adopted a landmark resolution—aimed at holding the five permanent Security Council members accountable for the use of their vetoes—which determined that, within 10 working days of a veto being cast against a draft resolution, the General Assembly President should convene a formal meeting to debate the relevant situation (unless the situation was already the focus of an emergency special session of the Assembly). The Security Council Affairs Division (SCAD) of the UN

So-called open meetings may be attended by non-members of the Council.

Informal `consultations of the whole’ are held in private with participation by all 15 Council members.

            The Security Council may—as provided for under Chapter VII of the UN Charter—take enforcement measures as a means of targeting regimes and entities that are deemed to threaten international peace and security, in situations where diplomatic efforts aimed at achieving a resolution to the situation have failed. The offending entities are expected to comply with a set of objectives issued by the Security Council aimed at restoring order. Such enforcement measures encompass mandatory economic and trade and/or other sanctions (such as financial or diplomatic restrictions, arms embargoes and bans on travel), and also, in certain cases, collective military action by a coalition of member states or a regional organization. 
            <xr pageref="N" ref="UN-IO.SC.SCOMMS.1">Sanctions committees</xr>
             are established to oversee the implementation of economic or political enforcement measures imposed by the Security Council; each committee is chaired by a non-permanent member of the Council. The sanctions that took effect against the Taliban leadership in Afghanistan and al-Qa`ida in January 2001 were the first to entail mandatory monitoring of the collateral humanitarian impact of punitive measures on the local population, in particular the most vulnerable groups. In December 2006 an informal working group recommended that resolutions enforcing sanctions should clearly specify intended goals and targets, include incentives to reward partial compliance, and should focus in particular on the finances and movements of leaders (so-called smart sanctions). Humanitarian exceptions may now be embodied in Security Council resolutions. The Consolidated Sanctions List comprises all individuals and entities on which the Council has imposed sanctions measures; at 31 December 2023 676 individuals and 193 entities were listed (36 individuals and 61 entities were de-listed by Committee decisions during that year). Petitioners seeking to submit a request for de-listing may do so either through their state of citizenship or residence, or through the

             UN Security Council Special Notices have been issued for individuals and entities that are subjected to UN sanctions regimes. These alert national law enforcement authorities to freezes imposed on funds and assets; travel restrictions; and arms embargoes. There is, however, no requirement to seize assets or to prosecute named individuals or entities. As at May 2024 525 Special Notices were active for individuals, and 108 for entities. In December 2017 the Security Council adopted Resolution 2399, which encourages biometric data to be attached to Special Notices for individuals.

            At the end of September 2001, following the unprecedented aerial terrorist attacks perpetrated on 11 September against targets in the USA, the Council adopted Resolution 1373, establishing a 
            <xr pageref="N" ref="UN.IO.SC.CTC.1">Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC)</xr>
            . In March 2004 the Council adopted a resolution to strengthen the Committee by classifying it as a special subsidiary body of the Council, headed by a Bureau and assisted by an Executive Directorate (the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate—CTED). In April the Security Council adopted Resolution 1540, which considered the threat posed by the possible acquisition and use by non-state actors, including terrorists, of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and demanded that all states establish controls to prevent the proliferation of such weapons. The resolution authorized the establishment of the 
            <xr pageref="N" ref="UN.IO.SC.1540">1540 Committee</xr>
             to monitor its implementation. UN member states are obliged to submit so-called matrix reports to the 1540 Committee outlining measures taken to prevent the proliferation of WMD. In 2018 the CTED signed the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Coordination Compact, which is co-ordinated by the 
            <xr pageref="N" ref="UNOCT.IO.1">UN Office of Counter-Terrorism (UNOCT)</xr>
            . The CTED supports the implementation of the UNOCT-led UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and of the Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism launched in 2015 by the UN Secretary-General. Jointly with UNOCT and other partners the CTED implements a Global Programme on Countering Terrorist Threats against Vulnerable Targets (focused specifically on threats against urban centres, major sports events, religious sites and touristic venues, and on the malicious use of unmanned air systems). In October 2023 the CTED convened an open meeting on countering terrorist narratives and preventing the use of the internet for terrorist purposes. In the following month it co-launched a report outlining challenges to bringing perpetrators to account for sexual and gender-based crimes. Security Council resolutions 2178 (2014) and 2396 (2017) require states to prevent their citizens from travelling to join terrorist groups, and also that they repatriate and prosecute such terrorist combatants.

The Council condemned the violent extremist ideologies of these groupings, their role in fomenting sectarian tensions, the devastating humanitarian impact of their activities, and their continued gross, systematic and widespread abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law. The Council urged all UN member states to adopt measures aimed at suppressing the flow of foreign terrorist com­batants to Iraq and Syria, and imposed punitive sanctions against a number of individuals affiliated with these terrorist groups and against any entity that planned for, financed, recruited or supplied weapons to them. In February 2015 the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2199, emphasizing that Islamic State, Jabhat al-Nusra and other terrorist groupings in Iraq and Syria should not be permitted to access the international financial system, receive donations or benefit from direct or indirect trade in petroleum and refined oil products, (looted) antiquities, or hostages. (Jabhat al-Nusra was restyled in July 2016, and merged with other militant groups in January 2017 to form Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham.) In March 2015 the grouping Jama'atu Ahlus Sunnah lid Da'awati wal Jihad, `Boko Haram’, pledged allegiance to Islamic State, formally becoming Islamic State's West Africa Province (ISWAP). (However, a splinter faction subsequently re-identified as Boko Haram.) </p>
                              <p>In December 2015 the Security Council expanded the existing al-Qa`ida Sanctions Committee to include Islamic State, and urged member states to participate actively in maintaining and updating the relevant Sanctions List. The Council unanimously adopted a resolution in December aimed at disrupting revenues channelled to Islamic State from ransom payments, sales of oil and antiquities, and other criminal activities. From January 2016 the UN Secretary-General issued regular reports to the Security Council on Islamic State. A pattern of brutal murders of hostages by Islamic State was consistently strongly condemned by the Council. In September 2017 the UN Secretary-General established the Baghdad, Iraq-based UN Investigative Team to Promote Accountability for Crimes Committed by Da’esh/ISIL (UNITAD), which was tasked with collecting evidence of acts committed by Islamic State over the period 2014-17 that might amount to crimes against humanity, war crimes, and genocide. The Iraqi authorities declared victory over Islamic State in December 2017. In March 2019 the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces recaptured Islamic State’s final territorial stronghold, the Syrian town of Baghouz Fawqani, thereby broadly defeating Islamic State’s five-year illegal caliphate. The Secretary-General subsequently reported, however, that since ceding territorial control in Syria, Islamic State had reconstituted itself as a clandestine network. In September 2021, to assist member states with the repatriation, prosecution and rehabilitation of foreign terrorist fighters, a Global Framework for UN Support on Syrian Arab Republic and Iraq Third Country National Returnees was initiated, with an associated multi-partner trust fund. In November a German court delivered the first conviction against an Islamic State member for genocide (of Yazidis), as well as finding him guilty of crimes against humanity resulting in death, war crimes, abetting war crimes, and bodily harm resulting in death.</p>
                              <p>
              The UN Secretary-General’s 18th report on Islamic State, issued at the end of January 2024, noted that it continued to pose a high threat to international peace and security, with a significant impact on conflict zones. The risk of a resurgence in Iraq and Syria remained, with a low-level insurgency involving asymmetric attacks having gathered pace there since late 2023. Islamic State’s strength across the two countries was assessed at between 3,000-5,000 fighters. Islamic State affiliates continued to contribute to a deterioration of the security situation in parts of West Africa and the Sahel (see 
              <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-UN.PB.0006">UNOWAS</xr>
              ). A trend towards attrition of the Islamic State leadership and greater devolution and autonomy of affiliates was noted. Following the death in April 2023 of the previous leader, apparently in Idlib, Syria, Abu Hafs al-Hashimi al-Qurashi had been named in August as the (fourth) overall `caliph’ of Islamic State. Islamic State’s core reserves were reported to be declining, and believed to amount to between US&#8201;$10m.-$25m., with costs—for example, payments to family members of dead or imprisoned fighters—exceeding revenue. Cash couriers and unregistered informal value transfer systems (`hawala’) were reported to be widely used. An increase was observed in the use of cryptocurrencies. By 1 May 2024 the Islamic State and al-Qa`ida Sanctions List comprised 256 individuals and 89 entities.

                              <p>In late August 2021, in the aftermath of the Taliban’s assumption of power in Afghanistan through force, the Security Council demanded that Afghan territory should not be used to threaten other countries or to shelter or train terrorists, or to plan or to finance acts of terrorism; called for strengthened efforts to provide humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan, and for unhindered access for humanitarian personnel; and reaffirmed the importance of upholding human rights, including those of women, children and minorities. In December the Council adopted a resolution that provided for a humanitarian aid exemption to the sanctions regime imposed on Afghanistan by Resolution 1988 (2011). In March 2022 the Council adopted Resolution 2626, which provided for the continued formal presence in Afghanistan of UN agencies. In December the Council stated deep concern over Taliban edicts that suspended access to secondary schools and universities by women and girls, and also their participation in non-governmental organizations. Resolution 2681, adopted in April 2023, condemned the Taliban’s decision to ban women from working for the UN in Afghanistan, and called for the full, equal, meaningful and safe participation of women and girls in Afghan society.</p>

                              <p>In May 2021 the Head of UNITAD announced the completion of initial investigations into Islamic State attacks that had been perpetrated against the Yazidi community in Sinjar (northern Iraq), and into the mass killing of unarmed military cadets and personnel at the Tikrit Air Academy in June 2014, and reported that `clear and convincing evidence’ had been established that genocide had been perpetrated against the Yazidis. The Security Council welcomed the successful organization of legislative elections in Iraq in October 2021.</p>
                              <p>In February 2022 the Council unanimously adopted a resolution that terminated the mandate of the UN Compensation Commission—established by the Council in May 1991 to assist victims of Iraqi aggression against Kuwait—and ordered that the associated compensation fund should be dissolved by the end of the year. In total, during 1991-13 January 2022 (the date of the final pay-out) US&#8201;$52,400m. had been allocated to 1.5m. claimants.</p>
                              <p>
              At the beginning of September 2022—in response to an outbreak at the end of August of violent political protests in Iraq—the Council condemned the violence and appealed for restraint, respect for constitutional order, and for the peaceful resolution of differences through dialogue. In May 2024 the UN Security Council renewed until 31 May 2025 the mandate of the

                              <p>The Council provides a forum for discussion of the situation in the Middle East and supports a comprehensive and just settlement to the situation. In March 2002 the Council adopted Resolution 1397, which envisaged two separate states of Israel and Palestine existing within secure and recognized borders. In November 2003 the Council endorsed the adoption, in April, by the so-called Quartet comprising (as `Principals’) envoys from the UN, the EU, Russia and the USA, of a `performance-based roadmap to a permanent two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict’.</p>
                              <p>
              In December 2015 the Security Council adopted Resolution 2334, which reaffirmed that under international law there was no validity to the establishment by Israel of settlements in Palestinian territory occupied since 1967. In February 2017 the newly inaugurated US Administration announced that the USA’s support for a peaceful resolution to the Israel-Palestine conflict would no longer be restricted to pursuing only a two-state solution. In mid-December the Council convened an emergency meeting to address a recent decision of the US Administration to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The Permanent Representatives of France, Germany, Italy, Sweden and the UK issued a joint statement that denounced the US decision, noting that this was not in line with resolutions of the Council and was not conducive to securing peace in the region. An emergency meeting of the Security Council convened in March 2018 to address a recent escalation of violence in Gaza, near the border with Israel, urged restraint on both sides. In May the UN Secretary-General expressed profound concern and urged maximum restraint by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and by the Palestinian Islamist militant and political organization Hamas in view of a sharp escalation of violence in Gaza, arising from Palestinian demonstrations against the repositioning in that month of the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, and the ongoing `Great March of Return’ wave of protests. In March 2019 an emergency meeting of the Council was convened following a unilateral proclamation by the US President recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. The majority of Council members upheld their existing position that the land was illegally occupied by Israel and expressed regret at the US decision. Addressing the Council at an open briefing in early February 2020, the leader of the Palestinian (National) Council, Mahmoud Abbas, strongly rejected a recent US proposal aimed at resolving the Palestine-Israel conflict (by, 
              <i>inter alia,</i>
               making Jerusalem the `undivided’ capital of Israel and legalizing Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem). At that event the UN Secretary-General reiterated the full support of the UN for a two-state solution. During that month the ministers responsible for foreign affairs of Egypt, France, Germany and Jordan (meeting on the sidelines of the annual Munich Security Conference) established a Munich Group, as a format for promoting Israel-Palestine peace efforts.

                              <p>
              In mid-May 2021 the Council convened a series of emergency meetings to address an intensive escalation of Hamas-Israeli conflict (see 
              <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-UN.1643">UNRWA</xr>
              ). A collective statement that would have condemned the force of Israel’s military response was reportedly blocked by the USA. On 22 May the Council issued its first statement on the crisis, in which it urged full adherence to an Egypt-mediated ceasefire that had entered into effect on the previous day. At a meeting of the Council held in February 2022 delegates urged Israel to halt ongoing evictions of Palestinian families from the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood of East Jerusalem; Israel’s Permanent Representative, meanwhile, demanded that Hamas should be listed by the Council as a terrorist group. During January-September 2023, following the accession to power in late December 2022 of a particularly hardline Israeli administration, and a subsequent intensification of violent unrest, the Council held numerous sessions on the Israel-Palestine situation. In February 2023 the Council adopted a presidential statement on the Question of Palestine, which expressed deep concern over a recent Israeli announcement that the construction, expansion and `legalization’ of settlements in occupied Palestinian territories would continue. The Council reaffirmed its unwavering commitment to the pursuit of a two-state outcome.
            </p>
                              <p>A `closed door’ emergency meeting of the UN Security Council was held on 8 October 2023, the day after devastating attacks on Israel by Hamas and the consequent declaration by Israel of a state of war, with retaliatory air, land and sea strikes against Gaza and a severing of water, food and power supplies to the territory; consensus was not, however, achieved, and no joint statement released. On 18 October a draft Council resolution, proposed by Brazil, that had called for humanitarian pauses in the continuing conflict to be used to deliver urgent essential aid to civilians in Gaza, was vetoed by the USA, on the grounds that the text made no mention of Israel’s right to self-defence. On 25 October the USA put forward a draft that called for a humanitarian pause, while emphasizing Israel’s right to self defence; this was vetoed by China and Russia. A subsequent text proposed by Russia was also rejected (it called for a humanitarian ceasefire and for the revocation by Israel of the evacuation order that it had imposed on Gazan civilians normally resident in the northern part of the enclave). The Council convened a further emergency session on the crisis at the end of October. On 15 November the Council adopted Resolution 2712, calling for urgent and extended humanitarian pauses and corridors through the Gaza Strip to facilitate the provision of essential goods and services, including fuel. It also called for the release of all hostages taken by Hamas on 7 October and urged all parties to refrain from depriving Palestinian civilians of humanitarian assistance. The resolution, which had been introduced by Malta, was the Council’s fourth attempt to adopt a binding text on the recent conflict; 12 member states voted in favour, while Russia, the UK and the USA abstained. A draft resolution tabled on 8 December by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) that demanded an unconditional immediate ceasefire was vetoed by the USA; the UN Secretary-General had cited Chapter XV: Article 99 of the UN Charter to warn the Council of impending humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza and to push for a Security Council vote on a ceasefire, representing the first time that Article 99 had been used in more than five decades. On 22 December the Council adopted, with Russia and the USA abstaining, Resolution 2720, which demanded that relevant parties allow, facilitate and enable the immediate, safe and unrestricted delivery of humanitarian assistance, at scale, directly to the Palestinian civilian population throughout Gaza. The UN Secretary-General was requested to appoint a Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator, who was to have responsibility for facilitating, co-ordinating, monitoring and verifying the humanitarian nature of relief consignments to Gaza. Closed consultations were held on 12 February 2024 to address a planned escalation of Israeli air strikes against targets in Rafah, southern Gaza, where a high proportion of Gazan residents had sought refuge. On 20 February the USA for the third time vetoed a draft resolution that called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza—stating that it would undermine negotiations on a deal to release the hostages held by Hamas. Later in that month the Council was briefed by three senior UN officials on the severe state of food insecurity in Gaza. At the end of February the USA unilaterally blocked a statement proposed by Algeria that sought to hold IDF soldiers responsible for the recent deaths of at least 112 food-insecure Palestinians who had reportedly been subjected to gunfire while chaotically approaching a convoy of vehicles bringing humanitarian aid. On 22 March Russia and China used their vetoes to oppose a US-sponsored resolution that demanded an immediate ceasefire tied to the freeing of the remaining Hamas-held hostages. The Council notably passed a resolution on 25 March (with 14 members voting in favour and the USA abstaining) that called for a ceasefire in Gaza during the remainder of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan (to lead to a lasting sustainable cessation of hostilities), and also demanded the hostages’ release—while not imposing the latter as a condition of the proposed ceasefire. In mid-April the USA vetoed a draft resolution that would have recommended that the General Assembly vote on whether to admit Palestine to full membership of the UN. (In mid-May the General Assembly adopted a resolution that determined that the state of Palestine qualified for and should be admitted to UN membership, and recommended that the Security Council reconsider the matter favourably.) An emergency meeting of the Council was convened in late May to discuss a recent IDF air strike that had killed 45 Palestinians sheltering in a camp in Rafah.</p>

              Meanwhile, in a related development, on 10 January 2024, the Security Council adopted Resolution 2722, which demanded that the (Iran-supported) Houthi (Ansar Allah) movement immediately cease attacking merchant and commercial vessels in the Red Sea. Houthi attacks on Israel-bound and affiliated oil tankers and other vessels in the Red Sea had increased as a repercussion of the Hamas-Israel conflict (see

              Libyan national elections that had been scheduled for December 2021 were postponed (and remained so as at March 2024—see

              ). A presidential statement was issued in March 2023 that reaffirmed the Council’s strong commitment to an inclusive, Libyan-led and Libyan-owned political process, facilitated by the UN and supported by the international community. The Council welcomed Egypt’s mediatory role in arranging talks (in Cairo) between Libya’s rival House of Representatives and High State Council. The Council commended extensive consultations undertaken by the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General (SRSG) for Libya with Libyan and regional stakeholders, and the international community, in pursuit of a consensus-based route towards national elections, and welcomed the SRSG’s initiative to launch a Libyan High-Level Panel for Elections. The Council reiterated grave concern over human trafficking and people smuggling through Libya. In early May 2024 the Council stated gratitude for the efforts of the outgoing SRSG for Libya, Abdoulaye Bathily, and called on the UN Secretary-General promptly to appoint a successor. The Council consistently re-authorizes inspections of vessels on the high seas off the coast of Libya that are suspected of being used for trafficking or smuggling.

              In February 2021, in response to the overthrow of the Myanma Government by a military junta, the Security Council issued a statement that stressed the need for dialogue and for continued support for the democratic transition process that had been initiated five years previously in that country, and urged the release of all detainees, including democratically elected President Win Myint and State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi. The Council stated concern in December at prison sentences imposed on the President, State Counsellor and others. In February 2022 the Council stated regret at the continuing state of emergency, and on its grave impact, and reiterated calls for the release of all those who remained arbitrarily detained by the junta. Deep concern was expressed at ongoing violence in the country, including attacks on critical infrastructure, such as health and education facilities, and at the large number of IDPs. The Council stated full support for the role of the

               in working to facilitate a peaceful solution to the Myanmar emergency. The Council reiterated the need to tackle the root causes of the longstanding crisis in Rakhine State. In July the Council condemned recent executions of opposition activists by the Myanmar military.

              In August 2015 the Security Council established a Joint UN-

               Investigative Mechanism, tasked with identifying those responsible for the use of chemicals as weapons in Syria. In October 2017 Russia (as well as Bolivia) vetoed a proposed resolution that was to have extended the mandate of the Mechanism for a further year. The seventh report of the Mechanism, which was issued shortly afterwards, apportioned blame to the Syrian regime for the sarin gas attack that had been perpetrated against Khan Sheikhoun in April. In mid-November Russia again vetoed the renewal of the Mechanism’s mandate. In mid-April 2018—reacting to air strikes conducted without a Security Council mandate by the USA, France and the UK to target chemical weapons manufacturing facilities and capabilities in Syria—the UN Secretary-General emphasized UN member states’ obligation to act in matters of peace and security in accordance with the UN Charter, and urged the Council to unite over demanding accountability for the use of chemical weapons in Syria. In March 2019 the OPCW transmitted to the Council a report on an alleged chemical weapons attack on civilians in Douma, Eastern Syria, perpetrated in April 2018; in this it found reasonable grounds to believe that a toxic chemical (containing reactive chlorine) had indeed been used as a weapon.
            </p>
                              <p>
              In October 2019 the Security Council President issued a statement welcoming the forthcoming establishment, under UN auspices, of an inclusive Syrian-led committee tasked with drafting a new Constitution for Syria. In January 2020 the Security Council approved a resolution renewing longstanding authorization for cross-border and cross-line humanitarian access to rebel-held areas of Syria; however, this was to be on a reduced scale: two of the hitherto four humanitarian border crossings were terminated. (Syria, backed by Russia, has denounced the UN’s aid delivery mechanism—endorsed by the Council without Syrian consent—as a violation of Syrian national sovereignty.) In accordance with a subsequent resolution approved in July a further humanitarian border crossing was closed. In June 2021 only the use of one such crossing (Bab al-Hawa, at the Syria-Türkiye border) was authorized. Humanitarian use of the Bab al-Hawa crossing was renewed for successive six month-periods in January 2022, July of that year, and in January 2023 (until 10 July). In February 2023 the UN Secretary-General welcomed a decision by the Syrian President to open, temporarily, the Bab al-Salam and Al-Ra’ee crossings at the Syria-Türkiye border in order to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid, in the aftermath of severe earthquakes that had struck northern Syria and southern Türkiye. On 11 July the Security Council failed to reach agreement on reauthorizing the use of the Bab al-Hawa crossing. A formal General Assembly meeting was subsequently convened to consider the matter. Eventually agreement secured with the Syrian authorities that enabled humanitarian operations to continue to use the Bab al-Hawa and two other temporary crossings until January 2024 (at that time the use of Bab al-Hawa was extended until 13 July). Also in July 2023, a delegate of the High Representative of the 
              <xr pageref="N" ref="UNODA.IO">UN Office of Disarmament Affairs</xr>
               informed the Council that the Syrian authorities had thus far failed to provide information that had been requested by the OPCW’s Technical Secretariat, including with regard to the detection in 2018 of a prohibited chemical at a scientific research facility in Barzah (to the north of Damascus).

Further urgent meetings of the Council were convened in early March. The UN Secretary-General expressed deep concern at a referendum held in mid-March (in which more than 95% of voters supported Crimean secession), and encouraged all parties to pursue a negotiated solution guided by the principles of the UN Charter, including respecting the unity and sovereignty of Ukraine. In July the Council strongly condemned the apparently deliberate shooting down of a Malaysia Airlines passenger flight over Donetsk Oblast, eastern Ukraine, that resulted in 298 fatalities; it called for an international investigation into the situation, and demanded that armed groups permit full access by international investigators to the crash site. In February 2015 an emergency meeting of the Council on the situation in Ukraine adopted a resolution endorsing the recently concluded `Minsk II’ package of measures for the implementation of the Minsk Agreements (that had been adopted in September 2014 by the parties to the conflict). In June 2018 the Council adopted a presidential statement (the first formal Council opinion on the situation in Ukraine since February 2015) that expressed grave concern on persistent ceasefire violations in eastern Ukraine, and urged all parties to the conflict there to recommit to the Minsk Agreements.</p>

              In February 2022 two emergency sessions of the Security Council were convened to discuss the intense build-up of Russian troops on its border with Ukraine and escalating diplomatic tensions. Following the initiation of a full military offensive by Russia against Ukraine, on 24 February, the Council met to consider a draft resolution demanding an immediate cessation of hostilities and withdrawal of all forces from Ukraine’s territory. Russia vetoed the resolution, while China, India and the UAE abstained. A few days later the Council adopted a rare procedural resolution, `Uniting for Peace’, that called for an emergency special session of the 
              <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-UN.390">UN General Assembly</xr>
               to be scheduled to consider and recommend collective action to address the situation in Ukraine (again 11 Council members voted in favour).

                              <p>Tense divisions over the conflict in Ukraine among the Council members, including the permanent members, continued to characterize debate. At the end of September 2022 Russia vetoed a draft Council resolution that had deemed a unilateral Russian move to annex four Ukrainian regions as a `threat to international peace and security’. In March 2023 only three Council members (Russia, China and Brazil) voted in favour of a draft resolution submitted by Russia that demanded an independent UN-led inquiry into a series of explosions that had occurred in September 2022 around two Nord Stream natural gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea that supply Russian gas to Europe. (The explosions had been widely attributed to Russia, but were attributed by Russia to the USA and US allies.) Russia continued thereafter to raise the issue. Council members participated in a briefing in late February 2024 that marked the second anniversary of the onset of Russia’s ongoing military offensive against Ukraine.</p>

              On 31 March 2022 the Security Council authorized an 
              <xr pageref="N" ref="AU.IO">African Union (AU)</xr>
               Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS), tasked with reducing the local threat posed by the al-Shabaab terrorist group, assisting efforts to build the capacity of the Somali security and police forces, supporting national peacebuilding and reconciliation activities, and undertaking a phased transfer of security responsibilities to the Somalian authorities. A phased reduction of the mission’s personnel was initiated in 2023, focused on a withdrawal deadline of December 2024. In November 2023 the Council renewed the mandate of ATMIS until 30 June 2024 and (slightly delaying the schedule of the second phase of the drawdown, at the request of the Somali authorities) authorized the deployment of up to 17,626 uniformed personnel until 31 December 2023 and of up to 14,626 uniformed personnel during the period 1 January-30 June 2024. In October 2023 the Council extended the mandate of the UN Assistance Mission in Somalia (UNSOM, initiated in May 2013) until 31 October 2024. In December 2023 the Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2713, which narrowed solely to al-Shabaab the sanctions regime and arms embargo that had been in place against Somalia since 1992; and Resolution 2714, which ended the punitive regime against the state of Somalia. The Council has repeatedly condemned al-Shabaab terrorist attacks against targets in Somalia.

                              <p>In early December 2022 the Security Council welcomed the signing by the Sudanese military authorities and a coalition of civilian leaders of a Sudan Political Framework Agreement, emphasizing that this was an essential step towards the achievement of an inclusive, lasting democratic political settlement in that country. Conclusive agreement remained elusive into 2023, however, including with regard to the proposed integration into the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) of the powerful paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF, formed in 2013). From 15 April 2023 the ongoing RSF-SAF tensions erupted into violent conflict across Khartoum and elsewhere, resulting in numerous fatalities. The Security Council met twice in April to discuss the crisis. In late April the UN Secretary-General urged the Security Council membership to exert maximum leverage on the warring parties to end the violence and resume the process towards democratic transition. In December the Council terminated the mandate of the UN Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in the Sudan (UNITAMS), in accordance with a request by the Sudanese authorities. The mission’s withdrawal was effected on 29 February 2024. The Council issued a statement in December 2023 that stated alarm at widening violence and worsening humanitarian conditions in Sudan, including reported attacks against civilians and other violations of international humanitarian law, and the expansion of fighting into locations accommodating large populations of internally displaced and other vulnerable persons—in particular in the Darfur region and Gezira State. All parties were urged to exercise restraint and to fulfil their obligations under international law.</p>

              In January 2023 the Council deplored an intensification of 23 March Movement (M23) attacks in North Kivu (eastern DRC), and condemned all foreign support being extended to non-state armed actors in that country. The M23 was urged to withdraw, within the framework of an AU-endorsed `Luanda Process’ aimed at ending the crisis in eastern DRC that had been agreed by regional leaders in November 2022. In March 2023, following a Council mission to the DRC’s capital Kinshasa and to Goma, North Kivu, a presidential statement was issued that commended the stabilizing efforts of the 
              <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-UN.PKO.9">UN Organization Stabilization Mission in the DRC</xr>
               (MONUSCO), while strongly condemning the violent unrest being fomented by the M23, the Islamic State-linked Allied Democratic Forces, the Coopérative pour le développement du Congo and the Forces démocratiques de libération du Rwanda. The Council demanded that all members of armed groups immediately and permanently disband. In December the Council endorsed a 12-month extension of MONUSCO’s mandate and a reduction in its mission strength, in accordance with a comprehensive disengagement plan. Also in December, the UN Group of Experts assisting the Council’s Sanctions Committee on the DRC recommended that the DRC authorities take action to safeguard the supply chain of minerals originating in Rubaya, North Kivu.

                              <p>The Council deplored repeated lethal attacks by militants against the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA). At the end of June 2023 the Council determined not to renew the mandate of MINUSMA upon its expiry, given recent demands by the transitional government in Mali for the withdrawal of the mission. The transfer of responsibilities for security and civilian protection, as well as the removal of all MINUSMA troops and personnel, was completed by 31 December. In August a resolution to extend the mandate of sanctions against Mali (imposed in 2017), as well as independent monitoring of the measures, was vetoed by Russia.</p>

              In October 2022 the Council commended the commitment of recently elected Colombian President Gustavo Petro to the full implementation of Colombia’s Final Peace Agreement (concluded in November 2017), and Petro’s policy of seeking `Paz Total’ (total peace) through dialogue. The Council welcomed the planned resumption (initiated in November 2022) of negotiations between the Colombian Government and the rebel Ejército de Liberación Nacional. In January 2023, at the request of the Colombian authorities, the UN Security Council expanded the mandate of the

               to encompass monitoring the implementation of the chapters of the Final Peace Agreement that relate to comprehensive rural reform and ethnic matters. In October 2023 UNVMC’s mandate was extended by the Council for a further 12 months, until 31 October 2024.

              In October 2022, through Resolution 2653, the Council unanimously approved targeted sanctions—including an arms embargo, asset freezes and a travel ban—against individuals participating in or facilitating gang violence in Haiti. A Panel of Experts on Haiti was established in December. The inaugural meeting of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to Resolution 2653 was convened in February 2023. In July the Council renewed for one year, until 15 July 2024, the mandate of the

At the beginning of October 2023, at Haiti’s request, the Council adopted Resolution 2699, authorizing the deployment of a new mission—the Multinational Security Support (MSS)—that was tasked with supporting the efforts of the Haiti National Police to quell the ongoing gang violence. It was envisaged that the re-establishment of security would enable long-postponed national elections to be organized. (As at mid-May 2024 preparations were underway for the deployment of the MSS.)

                         <p>The allocation of the Security Council's five permanent seats reflects the global balance of power in the aftermath of the Second World War. It is envisaged that—by establishing a more equitable representation of regions and also between advanced and developing economies, and by generally expanding participation—reforms to the composition of the Council would better reflect modern geopolitical priorities and realities, and would thereby enhance the authority and perceived legitimacy of the Council’s decisions. However, the various specific visions that have emerged have not proved easily reconcilable. The IGN were initiated in February 2009, under the auspices of the UN General Assembly, and in September 2015 the General Assembly adopted an initial framework document—with a view to clarifying the process and underpinning further discussions—covering the various visions for reform. Subsequently, however, the process (which was being chaired in 2024 by Austria and Kuwait) has failed to advance significantly.</p>

                                   <p>The Mechanism was established by Security Council Resolution 1966 (December 2010) to undertake some essential functions of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia (also referred to as the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia—ICTY) and of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) pending and after their closure. The Mechanism was mandated to conduct any appeals against Tribunal judgments filed following its entry into operation.</p>
                                   <p>The ICTY was established in May 1993 by Security Council Resolution 827, and was inaugurated in The Hague, Netherlands, in November. The first trial proceedings commenced in May 1996. Having completed its scheduled work, the ICTY closed formally on 31 December 2017. The Tribunal finalized proceedings against 161 indictees, including Bosnian Serb political and military leaders and the President of the then Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Slobodan Milošević (who died in the custody of the Court in March 2006). Of those who appeared before it, 19 were acquitted, 90 received a final guilty sentence, and 13 were referred to national jurisdictions. The ICTY assisted with the establishment of the War Crimes Chamber within the Bosnia and Herzegovina state court, which became operational in March 2005, and also helped Croatia to strengthen its national judicial capacity to enable war crimes to be prosecuted within that country.</p>
                                   <p>In March 2019 the Appeals Chamber of the IRMCT ruled against an appeal by Radovan Karadžić (sentenced in March 2016 to charges including the murder of 7,000 Muslim men and boys at Srebreniča in 1995); his sentence was extended from 40 years to lifelong imprisonment. In June 2021 an appeal by Ratko Mladić (found guilty in November 2017 of genocide and crimes against humanity) was dismissed. (In May 2024 the IRMCT refused a request made by Mladić—who cited humanitarian grounds—for provisional release or transfer to Serbia.) At the end of June 2021, after a retrial, Jovica Stanišić, the former head of the Serbian state security service, and Franko Simatović, who had also been employed by the service, were found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity, and received 12-year sentences; they subsequently initiated an appeal, which was rejected in May 2023. At March 2024 international arrest warrants issued in 2015 remained in place for two lawyers who had served on the defence team of Vojislav Šešelj—the founder of the ultra-nationalist Serbian Radical Party, whose acquittal by the ICTY in March 2016 on war crimes charges had been successfully appealed in April 2018 by IRMCT prosecutors. They were charged with contempt, accused of having interfered with the ICTY’s lawful proceedings by procuring witness statements unethically.</p>
                                   <p>The ICTR had been established in November 1994 to prosecute persons responsible for genocide and other serious violations of humanitarian law that had been committed during that year in Rwanda, as well as by Rwandans in neighbouring states; it was terminated on 31 December 2015. During the course of its operations the ICTR indicted 95 individuals (with two indictments subsequently withdrawn), and—although eight indictees evaded capture—proceedings against 85 of the accused reached conclusion (including five cases that were transferred to other jurisdictions: two to France and three to Rwanda). Some 14 accused were acquitted by the Tribunal. In May 2020 the French authorities arrested Félicien Kabuga, who had been indicted by the ICTR in 1997 on charges relating to genocide and crimes against humanity, including providing financial backing to the perpetrators of the Rwandan atrocities. Kabuga was transferred into the custody of the Mechanism in October 2020, and appeared for the first time there in November. Kabuga’s trial commenced in The Hague, in September 2022, having been relocated from the Arusha branch on grounds of concern for his health. In March 2023 the Court agreed to suspend proceedings further to medical reports regarding Kabuga’s fraility and cognitive state. He was ruled unfit to stand trial in June and proceedings against him were suspended indefinitely, although he remained in detention. The Court determined to formulate a proceeding to enable evidence to be heard, with no possible judicial outcome.</p>
                                   <p>Intelligence activities to help track and identify fugitives have been undertaken by a specialist IRMCT team. In mid-2020 the IRMCT confirmed that the mortal remains of Augustin Bizimana, a senior minister in Rwanda’s interim government during the 1994 genocide, had been identified, having been discovered at a grave site at Pointe Noire, Republic of the Congo. In May 2022 the Court confirmed the death, in 2006, of Protais Mpiranya, who had been a senior commander of the Presidential Guard of the Rwandan Armed Forces during the genocide, and, in 2002, of Lt-Col Phénéas Munyarugarama, who had been accused of committing and inciting genocide in the Bugesara district. In February 2023 the UN detention facility in Arusha, Tanzania was closed. In May Fulgence Kayishema, who had been indicted by the Court in 2001 on charges of genocide, including the murder in April 1994 of some 2,000 Tutsis sheltering in a church, was arrested in South Africa. In accordance with a decision of the Court in 2012 he was to be transferred to stand trial in Rwanda. In November 2023 the IRMCT Prosecutor confirmed the death, in mid-1997, of Aloys Ndimbati, a mayor in the Kibuye Prefecture, who had been indicted on multiple charges of genocide; proceedings against Ndimbati were consequently terminated in March 2024. In May the Office of the Prosecutor confirmed that the last two remaining fugitives, `Ryandikayo’ and Charles Sikubwabo, had died in 1998. Both had first been indicted in November 1995 on charges that included genocide, complicity in genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide, murder as a crime against humanity, and extermination as a crime against humanity. In February 2024 the Prosecutor announced that the Kigali office of the IRMCT was to close on 31 August.</p>

                         <p>Adopted 22 Dec. 2017. Condemned in the strongest terms the launch of a ballistic missile by North Korea on 28 Nov. Capped that country’s imports of refined petroleum products at a reduced level of 500,000 barrels for 12 months, with effect from 1 Jan. 2018, and maintained the existing cap on imports of crude oil for that period (of 4m. barrels). Banned all exports from North Korea of food and agricultural products, machinery, electrical equipment, wood, magnesite and magnesia, and vessels, as well as the sale or transfer of fishing rights. Banned the supply, sale or transfer to North Korea of all transportation vehicles, industrial machinery, iron, steel and other metals (with the exception of spare parts for maintaining existing commercial civilian passenger aircraft). Demanded the repatriation within 24 months of all North Korean individuals earning income abroad (exempting some humanitarian personnel). Noted with great concern that North Korea was illegally exporting items subject to the sanctions regime (such as coal) through deceptive maritime practices, and that, likewise, it was acquiring petroleum through illegal ship-to-ship transfers. Authorized member states to inspect, seize, freeze and impound any vessel in their territorial waters that was illicitly smuggling banned commodities from North Korea or supplying petroleum to that country. Reiterated condemnation of North Korea for diverting its scarce resources to prioritize the pursuit of ballistic and nuclear weapons over the considerable unmet needs of its population, and reaffirmed that the measures imposed were not intended to have an adverse humanitarian impact. Noted that OCHA had found that well over one-half of North Korea’s population lacked secure access to food or to medical care. Reaffirmed support for the resumption of the international six-party talks concerning North Korea’s nuclear programme. Stated that additional nuclear weapons or long-range ballistic missile tests by North Korea would prompt further restrictions on its import of petroleum. Imposed an asset freeze on the Ministry of the People’s Armed Forces, and an asset freeze and travel ban on 16 further individuals (primarily in the banking sector). </p>

Strongly condemned continuing violence and instability in the CAR, as well as threats of and incitement to violence and to inter-community hatred, violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law, the denial of humanitarian access, and the unbroken cycle of provocations and reprisals made by militant groups. Extended the application of the existing sanctions regime on that country to individuals and entities responsible for (directly or indirectly) having supplied, sold or transferred to CAR-based armed groups or criminal networks arms (or any related materiel), or any technical or financial assistance, and to recipients of these; and to individuals and entities that were involved in planning, directing or committing acts in the CAR that were in contravention of international human rights or humanitarian law (including sexual and gender-based violence); or involved in recruiting or using children in armed conflict; or in illegally exploiting or trading in natural resources (including diamonds, gold, wildlife and wildlife products) to support armed groups or criminal networks in the CAR; or in obstructing the provision of humanitarian assistance; or in planning, directing, sponsoring, or undertaking attacks against UN missions or other international security presences; or in the leadership of entities that were designated under the sanctions regime. The arms embargo was not to apply to MINUSCA, EU training missions, French forces, or to the CAR-Chad-Sudan tripartite force border force (established in 2011).</p>

Strongly condemned the use of starvation of civilians as a method of warfare and strongly condemned the unlawful denial of humanitarian access to civilian populations. Recalled that sanctions may be imposed against individuals or entities impeding the delivery or distribution of humanitarian assistance to civilians in need. Strongly urged states to conduct independent, impartial and effective investigations within their jurisdiction into violations of international humanitarian law relating to the use of starvation of civilians as a method of warfare—including the unlawful denial of humanitarian assistance, and to hold the perpetrators accountable.</p>

Called upon all parties to armed conflict to comply strictly with their obligations under international law to protect civilians, including youth. Called on member states to protect educational institutions as spaces free from all violence, to ensure that such institutions are accessible to all (including disadvantaged) youth, and to ensure young women’s equal enjoyment of their right to education.
