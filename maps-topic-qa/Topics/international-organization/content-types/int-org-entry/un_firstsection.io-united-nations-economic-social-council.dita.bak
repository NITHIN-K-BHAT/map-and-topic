                         <p>The Council undertakes a co-ordinating function between the UN and its specialized agencies, and also offers a forum for dialogue on sustainable development issues with policymakers, non-governmental organizations, foundations, academics and the private sector.</p>
                         <p>In June 2021 the UN General Assembly determined to restructure ECOSOC’s annual fora and so-called `segments’ into four distinct groupings: the annual Partnership Forum and a new Coordination Segment, to take place, in tandem, each year by early February; the Forum on Financing for Development (FfD) Follow-up, the Multi-stakeholder Forum on Science, Technology and Innovation for the SDGs, the Youth Forum, and the biennial Development Cooperation Forum (DCF); segments on operational activities for development, humanitarian affairs, and transition from relief to development; and the main annual ECOSOC high-level segment, held in July, which includes the annual UN HLPF on Sustainable Development. Special sessions and ad hoc meetings may be organized. Meeting formats are normally in-person, with an additional option of virtual participation.</p>
                         <p>The 2024 Partnership Forum was held at the end of January, on the theme `Reinforcing the 2030 Agenda and eradicating poverty in times of multiple crises: the effective delivery of sustainable, resilient and innovative solutions’. The 2024 Coordination Segment followed on 31 January-1 February. Priorities raised at the Forum—which promotes collaboration with foundations and the private sector—are channelled each year into subsequent meetings.</p>
                         <p>ECOSOC’s FfD Follow-up is mandated to review the Addis Ababa Action Agenda that was adopted in July 2015 by the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, as well as other financing for development outcomes, and means of implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that were endorsed by UN heads of state and of government in September 2015. Within the framework of the FfD, ECOSOC holds annual high-level consultations with the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization and the UN Conference on Trade and Development. The ninth FfD was held in late April 2024.</p>
                         <p>The DCF—with participation by representatives of UN bodies, development agencies, regional development banks, civil society and private sector—is mandated to advance the implementation of all internationally agreed development goals and to promote dialogue to find effective ways of supporting international development. The 2023 DCF, held in mid-March, focused on the human outcomes of development co-operation policies and practices. The 2024 Youth Forum—including young business people, students and delegates of youth organizations—was convened in mid-April. The annual Multi-Stakeholder Forum on Science, Technology and Innovation for the SDGs was organized in May.</p>

                         <p>The Forum meets annually at ministerial level under the auspices of ECOSOC and every four years under the General Assembly. The first meeting under the auspices of ECOSOC was held in June-July 2014. Since 2016 the HLPF has conducted regular reviews relating to the follow-up and implementation of sustainable development commitments and objectives, in accordance with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The HLPF is the principal UN platform on sustainable development and adopts intergovernmental negotiated political declarations. The 2024 regular HLPF, to be held in mid-July, was to focus on progress achieved in the implementation of SDGs 1 (on ending poverty), 2 (on ending hunger), 13 (combating climate change), 16 (promoting peaceful and inclusive societies), and 17 (on partnerships).</p>

                              <b>Regional Forums for Sustainable Development</b>
             are convened annually by the Regional Commissions (in collaboration with other UN agencies) as regional platforms for sharing knowledge and best practices, and reviewing progress in support of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. From 2020, with a view to streamlining co-ordination, five Regional Collaborative Platforms (RCPs) were initiated, with participation by all development-focused UN agencies working within each region. Each RCP is chaired by the UN Deputy Secretary-General. The heads of the relevant UN Regional Economic Commission and UNDP Regional Bureau act as Vice-Chairs.
