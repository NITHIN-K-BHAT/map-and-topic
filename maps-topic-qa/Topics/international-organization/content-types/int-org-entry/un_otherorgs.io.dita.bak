The offending entities are expected to comply with a set of objectives issued by the Security Council aimed at restoring order. Such enforcement measures encompass mandatory economic and trade and/or other sanctions (such as financial or diplomatic restrictions, arms embargoes and bans on travel), and also, in certain cases, international military action. Sanctions committees are established to oversee the implementation of economic or political enforcement measures imposed by the Security Council. The Consolidated Sanctions List comprises all individuals and entities on which the Council has imposed sanctions measures, under all punitive regimes. A Focal Point for De-listing, established in December 2006, by Resolution 1730, receives and processes requests from individuals and entities wishing to be removed from sanctions lists, with the exception of the ISIL (Da’esh) and al-Qa`ida Sanctions List. By mid-2023 a total of 119 de-listing requests had been received by the Focal Point; of these, 113 had been fully processed, resulting in the de-listing of 17 individuals and also of 17 entities.</p>

               <p id="UN.IO.MICT.33" usage="casee ass">The Mechanism was established by Security Council Resolution 1966 (December 2010) to undertake some essential functions of the so-called International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia (also referred to as the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia—ICTY) and of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), pending and after their closure. The IRMCT comprises a branch that is based in Arusha, Tanzania (which commenced operations on 1 July 2012), and a branch based in The Hague, Netherlands (operational from 1 July 2013). The Mechanism is mandated to conduct any appeals against Tribunal judgments filed following its entry into operation.</p>
               <p usage="casee">The ICTY was established in May 1993 by Security Council Resolution 827, and was inaugurated in The Hague, Netherlands, in November. The first trial proceedings commenced in May 1996. Having completed its scheduled work, the ICTY closed formally on 31 December 2017. The Tribunal finalized proceedings against 161 indictees, including Bosnian Serb political and military leaders and the President of the then Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Slobodan Milošević (who died in the custody of the Court in March 2006). Of those who appeared before it, 19 were acquitted, 90 received a final guilty sentence, and 13 were referred to national jurisdictions. The ICTY assisted with the establishment of the War Crimes Chamber within the Bosnia and Herzegovina state court, which became operational in March 2005, and also helped Croatia to strengthen its national judicial capacity to enable war crimes to be prosecuted within that country. In March 2019 the Appeals Chamber of the IRMCT ruled against an appeal by Radovan Karadžić (sentenced in March 2016 to charges including the murder of 7,000 Muslim men and boys at Srebreniča in 1995); his sentence was extended from 40 years to lifelong imprisonment. In June 2021 an appeal by Ratko Mladić (found guilty in November 2017 of genocide and crimes against humanity) was dismissed. At the end of that month, after a retrial, Jovica Stanišić, the former head of the Serbian state security service, and Franko Simatović, who had also been employed by the service, were found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity, and received 12-year sentences; they subsequently initiated an appeal, which was rejected at the end of May 2023. At mid-2023 international arrest warrants issued in 2015 remained in place for two lawyers who had served on the defence team of Vojislav Šešelj—the founder of the ultra-nationalist Serbian Radical Party, whose acquittal by the ICTY in March 2016 on war crimes charges had been successfully appealed in April 2018 by IRMCT prosecutors. They were charged with contempt, accused of having interfered with the ICTY’s lawful proceedings by procuring witness statements unethically.</p>
               <p usage="ass">The ICTR, established in November 1994 by Security Council Resolution 955 to prosecute persons responsible for genocide and other serious violations of humanitarian law that had been committed during that year in Rwanda, as well as by Rwandans in neighbouring states, was terminated on 31 December 2015. During the course of its operations the ICTR indicted 95 individuals (with two indictments subsequently withdrawn), and—although eight indictees evaded capture—proceedings against 85 of the accused reached conclusion (including five cases that were transferred to other jurisdictions: two to France and three to Rwanda). Some 14 accused were acquitted by the Tribunal. In mid-May 2020 the French authorities arrested Félicien Kabuga, who had been indicted by the ICTR in 1997 on charges relating to genocide and crimes against humanity, including providing financial backing to the perpetrators of the Rwandan atrocities. Kabuga was transferred into the custody of the Mechanism in October 2020, and appeared for the first time there in November. Kabuga’s trial commenced in The Hague, in September 2022, having been relocated from the Arusha branch on grounds of concern for his health. In March 2023 the Court agreed to suspend proceedings further to medical reports regarding Kabuga’s fraility and cognitive state. He was ruled unfit to stand trial in June. The Court determined to formulate a proceeding to enable evidence to be heard, with no possible judicial outcome. In February 2023 the UN detention facility in Arusha, Tanzania was closed. In May Fulgence Kayishema, who had been indicted by the Court in 2001 on charges of genocide, including the murder in April 1994 of some 2,000 Tutsis sheltering in a church, was arrested in South Africa. In accordance with a decision of the Court in 2012 he was to be transferred to stand trial in Rwanda. Two indictees remained at liberty as at November 2023.</p>

               <p id="IO-OTHERUN.33">The Office was established in January 1998 as part of the UN Secretariat, with a mandate to co-ordinate international hum­ani­tarian assistance and to provide policy and other advice on hum­ani­tarian issues. A complementary service, Reliefweb, provides humanitarian updates on, and analysis of, natural disasters and other crisis situations.</p>
               <p>OCHA managed the preparatory process leading to the inaugural World Humanitarian Summit, which was convened in May 2016, in İstanbul, Turkey (Türkiye). Some 55 heads of state and government attending the meeting endorsed a new Agenda for Humanity, incorporating the following five core humanitarian responsibilities: Political leadership to prevent and end conflict; Uphold the norms that safeguard humanity; Leave no one behind; Change people’s lives: from delivering aid to ending need; and Invest in humanity.</p>
               <p>OCHA facilitates inter-agency appeals, which aim to co-ordinate resource mobilization following humanitarian crises. Since 2013 appeals have been formulated within the framework of a Humanitarian Programme Cycle, comprising the following five elements: needs assessment and analysis; strategic response planning; mobilization of resources; implementation and monitoring; and operational evaluation. In late 2022 OCHA issued its Global Humanitarian Overview (2023), comprising country Humanitarian Needs Overviews, Humanitarian Response Plans (HRPs), and other response initiatives. At that time OCHA appealed for US&#8201;$51,500m. to respond to the very urgent needs of 203m. people in 69 countries during 2023. Global requirements are adjusted continuously throughout each year as response initiatives are revised to reflect ongoing needs. </p>

               <p usage="io-unother.isdr.2">The Office was established in 1999 as an inter-agency secretariat to implement the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR), formally adopted by UN member states in 2000. The ISDR was intended to guide and co-ordinate international efforts towards achieving substantive reduction in disaster losses, and building resilient communities and nations as the foundation for sustainable development activities. The Office (known until 2019 as UNISDR) led efforts to formulate a UN Plan of Action on Disaster Risk Reduction for Resilience, which was adopted in 2013.</p>
               <p>In March 2015 the Office organized the Third UN World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction, held in Sendai City, Japan, which adopted the (non-binding) Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, covering the period 2015-30. The Sendai Framework listed seven measurable targets, four priorities, and a set of guiding principles related to disaster risk reduction planning, with the aim of lowering during 2020-30 the global mortality rate from disasters, as well as the numbers of people affected by disasters, compared with the rate in 2005-15; reducing disaster-related economic losses; and preventing disaster-related damage to basic services, infrastructure and livelihoods. Furthermore, public access to disaster risk information and early warning systems was to be enhanced. In view of rapidly advancing urbanization globally, the Sendai Framework placed a focus on building safer cities. A Sendai Framework Monitor that was launched in 2018 tracks progress in implementing the Framework in the context of 38 globally agreed indicators.</p>
               <p>UNDRR serves as the focal point providing guidance for the implementation of the Sendai Framework. It also organizes the biennial sessions of the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction (seventh session: May 2022, in Bali, Indonesia), and promotes information sharing on disaster risk reduction.</p>

               <p id="IO-OTHERUN.649">The Office was established in November 1997 (as the UN Office of Drug Control and Crime Prevention) to strengthen the UN's integrated approach to issues relating to drug control, crime prevention and international terrorism.</p>
               <p usage="casee">During the period 1 November 2020-31 October 2023 UNODC was implementing a regional programme, Southeast Europe Together Against Corruption (SEE-TAC), with a focus on enhancing the capacity of governments, private sector entities, civil society agencies and the media to prevent and combat corruption.</p>
               <p usage="eerca">A UNODC Programme for Central Asia being implemented during 2022-25 was focused on five pillars: Preventing and countering transnational organized crime; Preventing crime, increasing access to justice and strengthening the rule of law; Addressing drug use, increasing treatment of drug use disorders, and preventing HIV/AIDs; Preventing and countering terrorism, violent extremism and radicalization that leads to violence; and Supporting research, trend analysis, policy, advocacy and forensics. UNODC supports the Central Asia Regional Information and Co-ordination Centre (CARICC), which was established in AlmatI, Kazakhstan, in February 2006, to combat illicit drug trafficking in that region. Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan participate in CARICC.</p>

        In June 2022 UNODC’s 
        <publ-name>World Drug Report</publ-name>
         stated that Afghanistan accounted for some 86% of global opium production in 2021. Around 80% of opiates produced in Afghanistan were smuggled abroad by transnational organized criminal groups, via Iran and Pakistan, with the remainder being routed through central Asian countries. In November 2022 UNODC estimated that—despite the Taliban regime in Afghanistan having banned, in April, the cultivation of opium poppies and all narcotics—some 233,000 ha of Afghanistan’s land surface was dedicated to poppy cultivation, compared with 177,000 ha in 2021. In June 2023 the 
        <publ-name>World Drug Report</publ-name>
         noted thus far in 2023 signs of a significant reduction in illicit opium cultivation in Afghanistan, but warned of a possible shift to increased local manufacture of methamphetamines and other synthetic drugs.
      </p>
               <p usage="sacac">In February 2022 UNODC launched a Strategic Vision for Latin America and the Caribbean covering the period 2022-25. This provided a roadmap for addressing challenges in four thematic areas: countering corruption and economic crime; combating organized crime; tackling the world drug problem; and enhancing crime prevention and criminal justice.</p>
               <p usage="sacac">UNODC implements technical programmes aimed at assisting the Haitian national authorities to strengthen control over national borders and ports, to trace illicit financial flows, and to collaborate on combating transnational crime, corruption, and drug and arms trafficking.</p>
               <p usage="ass">In February 2021 UNODC launched a Strategic Vision for Africa 2030, which aimed to develop innovative ways of strengthening crime and corruption prevention, criminal justice systems, drug control, and relevant legislation in the region. In July 2009 UNODC, other UN agencies, the Economic Community of West African States and INTERPOL launched the West Africa Coast Initiative (WACI), which aimed to build national and regional capacities to combat drug trafficking and organized crime in, initially, four post-conflict countries: Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia and Sierra Leone. In February 2010 the participating countries signed the `WACI Freetown Commitment’, endorsing the implementation of the initiative, and agreeing to establish specialized transnational crime units on their territories. WACI activities were subsequently expanded to Guinea.</p>
               <p usage="sacac fea">UNODC supports national monitoring systems that assess the extent and evolution of illicit crops in the world's principal plant-based drug growing countries: Bolivia, Colombia and Peru (coca); Afghanistan, Myanmar and Mexico (opium); and Morocco (cannabis). Crop surveys are facilitated by a combination of satellite sensing, aerial surveillance and ground-level surveys, which provide a reliable collection and analysis mechanism for data on the production of illicit substances. The Office’s Alternative Development Programme supports projects to create legal sources of income for farmers economically dependent on the production of illicit narcotic crops, and promotes linkages between drug control policies and development.</p>
               <p usage="sacac">In September 2023 UNODC expressed concern at the increasing prevalence of coca cultivation in Colombia, estimated to have risen by 13% in 2022 compared with the previous year.</p>

               <p id="IO-OTHERUN.652">OHCHR is a body of the UN Secretariat and is the focal point for UN human rights activities. The Office's Geneva headquarters incorporates the following three divisions: Human Rights Council (HRC) and Treaty Mechanisms; Thematic Engagement, Special Procedures and Right to Development; and Field Operations and Technical Co-operation. The High Commissioner is the UN official with principal responsibility for UN human rights activities.</p>
               <p>As at 1 June 2023 OHCHR was concerned with 45 thematic mandates (for example addressing the independence of judges and lawyers; rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association; arbitrary detention; adequate housing; and obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment).</p>
               <p usage="eerca">In March 2021 the HRC adopted a resolution which requested the Office to carry out a comprehensive examination of all alleged human rights violations committed in Belarus since 1 May 2020, in the context of the run up to and aftermath of that country’s August 2020 presidential election; the resulting report found considerable evidence of human rights violations committed between 1 May 2020 and 31 December 2021. In March 2022 the Office reported that a consistent pattern of arrests, detention, ill treatment, torture, rape and other sexual and gender-based violence, and systematic denial of fair trail rights had been used by the Belarusian authorities to suppress opposition supporters. During 9-14 August 2020 (i.e. during and immediately after the controversial presidential election) some 13,500 people were reported to have been arbitrarily detained in that country, and overall over the period May 2020-May 2021 at least 37,000 arbitrary detentions were reported, including of opposition figures and supporters, journalists, lawyers and human rights defenders. At 30 May 2023 1,511 people remained imprisoned in contexts that OHCHR regarded as politically motivated. The Office reported, furthermore, that the Belarusian Government had introduced new legislation aimed at curtailing fundamental freedoms.</p>
               <p usage="eerca">
        In late February 2022 the High Commissioner confirmed that the Office’s Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU, first deployed in Ukraine, at the invitation of its Government, in 2014) would remain in that country following the military invasion by the Russian Federation, and would monitor and report on the evolving conflict situation. The High Commissioner demanded respect for international humanitarian law and protection of the civilian population as an urgent priority. In early March the 49th session of the HRC adopted a resolution that condemned alleged violations of human rights arising from Russia’s aggression in Ukraine and established a CoI to investigate the situation. The CoI conducted its first mission to Ukraine in June. Having visited 27 towns and settlements, inspected relevant sites, and interviewed 191 victims and witnesses, in Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Suny (Ukraine), in September the CoI concluded that war crimes, and violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law had been committed there, mainly by the Russian military. The Commission detailed, 
        <i>inter alia,</i>
         the indiscriminate use of explosive weapons in populated areas and attacks on fleeing civilians; failure to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure through the placement of military forces and objects in or in close proximity to densely populated areas; illegal deportations of Ukrainians to Russia; and unlawful confinement, torture, summary executions, and sexual violence perpetrated in Russian-occupied areas. The Commission formally submitted its findings to the UN General Assembly in October. The 10th mission to Ukraine by the Commission, undertaken in December, was particularly focused on the destruction of civilian infrastructure and the impact of the war on children’s rights and lives.
      </p>
               <p usage="eerca">On 22 August 2022 the UN Secretary-General announced the composition of a new Fact-Finding Mission which had been established, at the request of the Russian and Ukrainian authorities, to investigate an attack on 29 July against a prison at Olenivka, Ukraine, which had caused at least 50 fatalities (culpability for which was attributed by each party to the conflict to the other). In March 2023 OHCHR stated deep concern over the recruitment to the Wagner Group, a Russian private paramilitary and security contractor, of detainees in Russian correctional facilities, who were reportedly being offered pardons and the transfer of remittances to relatives, in return for joining the organization to participate in the invasion of Ukraine.</p>
               <p usage="eerca">During 24 February 2022-30 June 2023 9,177 war-related civilian fatalities were recorded by the HRMMU in Ukraine. A further 15,993 civilians were reported to have suffered conflict-related injuries over that period.</p>
               <p usage="ass">
        OHCHR was also concerned as at 1 June 2023 with 14 country mandates, including for Burundi (mandate established in 2021); the Central African Republic (2013); Eritrea (2012); Mali (2013); and Somalia (1993). The mandate of the UN Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent (established in 2002) was renewed in 2020. At mid-2023 OHCHR was supporting, 
        <i>inter alia</i>
        , a Commission on Human Rights (CoHR) that was examining the situation in South Sudan (following a resolution adopted in March 2016 by the Human Rights Council); an International Team of Experts (ITE) on the Democratic Republic of the Congo (authorized in June 2017 with an initial focus on that country’s Kasaï region; in October 2021 the scope of the ITE’s mandate was extended to cover the whole country); and an International Commission of Human Rights Experts on Ethiopia (authorized in December 2021). In February 2021 the CoHR on South Sudan welcomed a decision made in January by the South Sudanese authorities to proceed with the establishment of a Hybrid Court for South Sudan and other transitional justice mechanisms, to facilitate accountability for violations of human rights committed during the conflict there (as provided for by a Revitalized Peace Agreement that had been concluded by the parties in September 2018). An International Independent Expert Mechanism to Advance Racial Justice and Equality in the context of Law Enforcement was established by the HRC in 2021, following the High Commissioner’s issuance of a report on racial justice and equality that included a new four-point agenda aimed at ending systemic racism and human rights violations by law enforcement agents against Africans and people of African descent.

               <p usage="sasia">OHCHR was also concerned as at 1 June 2023 with 14 country mandates, including for Afghanistan (mandate established in 2021). Pursuant to a resolution adopted in March 2021 by the HRC, the High Commissioner established the Sri Lanka Accountability Project, focused on strengthening OHCHR’s capacity to collect and analyse data on human rights violations and related crimes in Sri Lanka; to advocate for victims and survivors; and to support relevant related judicial proceedings.</p>
               <p usage="mena">
        OHCHR was also concerned as at 1 June 2023 with 14 country mandates, including for Iran (mandate established in 2011), the Palestinian Territories (1993, to be maintained pending `the end of the Israeli occupation’), and Syria (established in 2011). At mid-2023 OHCHR was supporting an International Commission of Inquiry (CoI) that was addressing the situation in Syria, in accordance with a UN Human Rights Council resolution adopted in August 2011; a CoI established in May 2021 to investigate humanitarian and human rights violations that were perpetrated leading up to and since 13 April 2021 in the Palestinian Territories, including East Jerusalem, and in Israel; and an Independent Fact-Finding Mission (FFM) mandated in November 2022 by the HRC’s 35th special session to investigate the deteriorating human rights situation in Iran, particularly with respect to women and children. The CoI on Syria’s first report was published in November 2011, and regular updates and recommendations have been issued subsequently. In March 2023 the CoI reported that the parties to the conflict in Syria continued to commit widespread human rights violations and abuses prior to the earthquakes that had devastated northern areas of the country in February, and that the emergency response initiative had been hindered by failure (of the parties to the conflict and also of the UN) to secure an immediate pause in hostilities, or to facilitate the delivery of life-saving aid. The adoption by the UN General Assembly in June of a resolution that authorized the establishment of an independent institution to clarify the fate and whereabouts of all missing persons in Syria was welcomed by the CoI. The first report of the CoI on the Palestinian Territories, issued in June 2022, deemed the forced displacement of Palestinians, demolitions of Palestinian homes, expansion of Israeli settlements, settler violence, discrimination against Palestinians, and blockade of Gaza to be factors that were contributing to recurring cycles of violence. The report also noted that the Israeli occupation was used by the Palestinian Authority as a justification for human rights violations and for failing to organize legislative and presidential elections, and that the Hamas leadership in Gaza had shown no commitment to international humanitarian law. In October the CoI notably reported to the UN General Assembly that there were reasonable grounds to conclude that the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory contravened international law, owing to its permanence and to the Israeli Government’s de facto annexation policies. Consequently, in December the UN General Assembly requested the International Court of Justice to issue an Advisory Opinion on the legal status and the consequences of Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory. In May 2023 the CoI on Palestine issued its 
        <publ-name>Detailed findings on attacks and restrictions on and harassment of civil society actors, by all duty bearers</publ-name>
        . In July of that year the FFM on Iran confirmed that its investigations would include the targeting and harassment of journalists connected to Iran, and of their families.

               <p usage="fea">OHCHR was also concerned as at 1 June 2023 with 14 country mandates, including for Cambodia (mandate established in 1993), Myanmar (1992), and North Korea (2004). During March 2017-September 2019 OHCHR supported a formal FFM, authorized by the HRC, that investigated allegations of state-sponsored mass systematic brutal attacks in Myanmar, in particular against the minority Rohingya ethnic group in Rakhine State. In September 2018 the FFM called for the investigation and prosecution of senior leaders of the Myanma Tatmadaw (military) in relation to allegations of `genocidal acts’, crimes against humanity and war crimes. An FFM report issued in July 2019 urged the international community to withdraw financial and other support from the Tatmadaw and for the imposition of sanctions against Tatmadaw-owned domestic companies, stating that revenues accrued by the Tatmadaw from business operations enabled it to conduct—without accountability—alleged grave violations of human rights. The CoI’s final report, released in September, emphasized that the 600,000 Rohingya who were still residing within Myanmar were subject to systematic persecution and were living under the threat of genocide, and that the Myanma Government was failing to prevent, to investigate, to criminalize effectively and to punish genocide. At that time the High Commissioner for Human Rights described Myanmar security operations against the Rohingya as `a textbook example of ethnic cleansing’. The FFM report noted that in attempting to quell civilian support for the Arakan Army (which since 2009 had been mounting an insurgency against the Myanma military), the Tatmadaw had restricted humanitarian access to ethnic Rakhine communities and had confined their freedom of movement, thereby harming their livelihoods and capacity to acquire food. The Myanma military was also accused of the torture and ill-treatment of suspected insurgents, and of perpetrating sexual and gender-based violence. The FFM found that Myanmar should be brought before the International Court of Justice on the grounds of failure to honour its obligations as a signatory of the 1948 Genocide Convention. During September the CoI transferred its collected evidence on alleged atrocities perpetrated within Myanmar to the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar (IIMM), which had been authorized by the HRC in September 2018, and was tasked with preparing files to be the basis of future criminal prosecutions under international law. In March 2021, following the Tatmadaw’s seizure of power in Myanmar in February, the IIMM stated that it was collecting evidence relating to arbitrary arrests, enforced disappearances, torture, and the use of force being perpetrated against civilians peacefully protesting the military coup. The Mechanism urged recipients of illegal orders to make direct contact with it, by secure means, to ensure eventual accountability for senior military personnel orchestrating human rights abuses. In that month the HRC adopted a resolution that requested the High Commissioner for Human Rights to monitor the ongoing situation in Myanmar, with a focus on accountability. The IIMM’s fourth report, issued in July 2022, noted that 3m. items of evidence had thus far been accumulated (such as documentation, interview statements, photographs and videos, geospatial imagery, and material from social media).</p>
               <p usage="fea">In accordance with a March 2017 resolution of the UN Human Rights Council a project aimed at advancing accountability in North Korea was initiated, based in Geneva and in Seoul, South Korea.</p>
               <p usage="sacac">The Human Rights Council established an International Fact-Finding Mission on Venezuela (FFMV) in September 2019 to assess alleged violations of human rights committed since 2014. In September 2020 the FFMV’s first report stated that the Venezuelan state must bring to account members of the security forces and intelligence agencies that were accused of perpetrating arbitrary detentions and systematic torture, enforced disappearances, and extrajudicial executions. The FFMV’s second report, issued in September 2021, found that Venezuela’s judiciary lacked independence, and reported that irregularities were occurring at all stages of the criminal process. Torture (including sexual violence), temporary enforced disappearances and arbitrary deprivation of life were reported, alongside widespread impunity. In October the FFMV stated deep concern over the recent death while in state custody of General Raúl Isaías Baduel (who had been detained since March 2017 and charged with treason and incitement to rebellion); irregularities regarding his case had been addressed in the report published in September 2021. In September 2022 the FFMV issued a report that provided an analysis of the chains of command in Venezuela’s military and civilian intelligence agencies, and the role of those agencies in suppressing dissent. At that time the FFMV also reported on violations perpetrated by state and non-state actors against local populations in gold mining areas in Venezuela’s (southern) Bolivar region. A Group of Human Rights Experts on Nicaragua was established in accordance with a resolution of the Human Rights Council that was adopted in March 2022, with a mandate to investigate human rights violations committed in Nicaragua since April 2018. An OHCHR report published in September 2022 stated that the human rights situation in Nicaragua had continued to deteriorate in recent months and some 200 people remained arbitrarily detained in inhumane conditions.</p>

        UNICEF was established in 1946 by the UN General Assembly as the UN International Children's Emergency Fund, with a focus on post-World War Two Europe. In 1953 the General Assembly extended indefinitely UNICEF’s mandate, which had expanded to cover children in developing countries, and revised its name (retaining the same acronym). UNICEF works to promote the rights and wellbeing of all children, adolescents and women—with particular emphasis on assisting the most vulnerable and disadvantaged—within the frameworks of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1989, and which by 2023 was almost universally ratified), and of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1979). UNICEF’s annual publication 
        <i>The State of the World’s Children</i>
         includes social and economic data relevant to the wellbeing of children.

               <p usage="casee">UNICEF recognizes that many Roma children are at risk of severe poverty and marginalization, and works with governments of European countries with Roma minorities to develop legal frameworks and standards to facilitate the recognition of the rights of all children, clear mechanisms of accountability, and the development of independent child rights institutions. UNICEF assists Roma families with accessing services, and also provides Roma parents with information relating to social protection, health, early childhood development and education. Some US&#8201;$37m. was requested by UNICEF for its 2023 humanitarian response programme for refugees and migrants travelling along the Mediterranean and Western Balkan routes.</p>
               <p usage="eerca">UNICEF appealed for US&#8201;$1,059m. to fund its activities in 2023 aimed at supporting 9.4m. vulnerable people (including 4m. children) in Ukraine and in countries hosting Ukrainian refugees. Some $829m. was to be allocated to operations within Ukraine, and $230m. to the refugee response. In total, UNICEF aimed to facilitate access to health care for 5.4m. children and women, to safe water for 5.7m. people, to mental health and psychosocial support for 4m. children and caregivers, and also to supply nearly 276,700 households with (UNICEF-funded) multi-purpose humanitarian cash transfers.</p>
               <p usage="sacac">UNICEF appealed for US&#8201;$723m. to fund its activities in Latin America and the Caribbean during 2023. Some $223m. was to be allocated to Venezuela, which included enabling access to primary health care for 650,000 women and children and to psychosocial and mental support for 160,000 children and their caregivers, screening 510,000 children for physical wasting, and ensuring access to safe water for 2.3m. people. Some $160m. was requested to support children who were `on the move’ in migration flows from Venezuela and other crisis-affected areas. UNICEF also appealed for $114m. to support children on the move in Mexico and Central America. The Fund requested $210m. to address the urgent humanitarian needs of children and their families in Haiti during 2023: 1m. children there were to be enabled to access education, 652,200 children and women to access health care, and 1.3m. people were to be provided with safe water.</p>
               <p usage="fea">UNICEF sought US $199m. to fund its humanitarian operations in East Asia and the Pacific in 2023. Some $170m. was requested to support its operations during that year in Myanmar, which were to include facilitating access to educational services for 750,000 children, ensuring that 750,000 children were vaccinated against measles, and providing WASH supplies for 800,000 beneficiaries.</p>

It is the principal organ of the UN General Assembly concerned with trade and development, and is the focal point within the UN system for integrated activities relating to trade, finance, technology, investment and sustainable development. It aims to maximize the trade and development opportunities of developing countries and to assist them to adapt to the increasing globalization and liberalization of the world economy. UNCTAD undertakes consensus-building activities, research and policy analysis and technical co-operation.</p>

A High-Level Mid-Term Review of the SAMOA Pathway, held in September 2019, at a special session of the UN General Assembly, in New York, issued a Political Declaration which called on UNCTAD to continue to assist SIDS to enhance capacity for trade expansion and competitiveness. UNCTAD, with UNEP and other partners, organizes a regular Oceans Forum on trade-related aspects of SDG 14 (`Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources’). The fourth Oceans Forum was held in April 2022 on the theme `A shift to a sustainable ocean economy: Facilitating post-COVID-19 recovery and resilience’. A Post-SAMOA Pathway instrument was under development in 2023.</p>

In June 2018 a Gebze, Türkiye-based Technology Bank for LDCs was inaugurated, tasked with broadening the application of innovation, science and technology in, and serving as a knowledge hub for LDCs. Five UN Conferences on LDCs have been convened under UNCTAD auspices. At the first part of LDC V, held in March 2022, in New York, USA, the Doha Programme of Action (DPoA) for LDCs was adopted. Endorsed in April by the UN General Assembly, the DPoA set out a roadmap for strengthening commitments between LDCs and development partners during the period 2022-31. In accordance with the DPoA an investment support centre for LDCs was to be established, and—to advance engineering, technology and mathematics education in LDCs and in countries that have recently graduated from that status—feasibility studies were to be undertaken on the future development of an online university or equivalent learning platform. The final session of LDC V, held in Doha (Qatar), in March 2023, focused on constructing plans and partnerships to underpin the delivery of the DPoA. In order to graduate from LDC status countries are required to meet at least two of three thresholds relating to gross national income per capita, the Human Assets Index, and the Economic Vulnerability Index; or to at least double the GNI per capita threshold.</p>

               <p id="IO-OTHERUN.661">Created in 1967 as the Trust Fund for Population Activities, the UN Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) was established as a Fund of the UN General Assembly in 1972 and was made a subsidiary organ of the UN General Assembly in 1979, with the UNDP Governing Council (now the Executive Board) designated as its governing body. In 1987 UNFPA's name was changed to the UN Population Fund (retaining the same acronym). UNFPA works to promote reproductive rights, and universal access to sexual and reproductive health, with a particular focus on women, adolescents and youth.</p>
               <p usage="ass">In November 2022 UNFPA published its Response Plan for the Horn of Africa 2022-23, which highlighted the impacts of the ongoing severe drought in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia and the worsening food and health crises. UNFPA estimated its combined funding needs, in particular to extend additional support for sexual and reproductive health services and to help to prevent gender-based violence, to be US&#8201;$113.7m.</p>

               <p id="IO-UN.1721.11">WFP, the principal food assistance organization of the UN, became operational in 1963. It aims to alleviate acute hunger by providing emergency relief following natural or man-made humanitarian disasters. It supplies food assistance (including in the form of targeted cash vouchers) in post-disaster situations, and to vulnerable populations in developing countries to improve nutrition and eradicate chronic undernourishment. It also aims to further social advancement through developing assets and promoting the self-reliance of poor families and communities. The principal planned outcomes of WFP’s strategic plan governing its activities during 2022-26 were: People are better able to meet their urgent food and nutrition needs; People have better nutrition, health and education outcomes; People have improved and sustainable livelihoods; National programmes and systems are strengthened; and Humanitarian and development actors are more efficient and effective.</p>
               <p usage="eerca">A US&#8201;$1,904m. transitional Interim Country Strategic Plan that was being implemented by WFP within Ukraine during the period 1 January 2023-30 June 2024 aimed to transfer cash, commodity vouchers and in-kind food to vulnerable people; to provide institutional feeding, for example to hospitals; and to support the Ukrainian Government and partners in strengthening national food systems.</p>

                    <p id="IO-CASEE.668">ICAO was founded in 1947, on the basis of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, signed in Chicago, in 1944, to develop the techniques of international air navigation and to help in the planning and improvement of international air transport.</p>
                    <p usage="eerca">
          In May 2018 the UN Secretary-General noted with concern the conclusion by a Joint Investigation Team (a co-operative undertaking between the Netherlands, Malaysia, Ukraine, Australia and Belgium) that a Russian missile launcher had been used in the July 2014 shooting down in eastern Ukrainian airspace of Malaysia Airlines passenger flight (`MH17’). In July 2020 the Netherlands Government decided that the Government of the Russian Federation should be tried at the European Court of Human Rights (a body of the Council of Europe) over its alleged role in the MH17 atrocity. In October of that year Russia withdrew from negotiations over MH17 with Australia and the Netherlands (which were seeking compensation). Australia and the Netherlands initiated legal proceedings against Russia at ICAO in March 2022, alleging that Russia had violated provisions of the Chicago Convention. In November, following a trial in the Netherlands instigated by Dutch public prosecutors, two Russians and one Ukrainian separatist were found guilty, 
          <i>in absentia,</i>
          of murdering all of the plane’s passengers and crew and were sentenced to life terms of imprisonment; their arrests were ordered.
        </p>
                    <p usage="eerca">An emergency meeting of the ICAO Council was held in May 2021 to address the forced diversion by the Belarusian regime of an international Ryanair passenger flight, FR4978, which, while crossing Belarusian air space had been intercepted by an armed Belarusian fighter jet and forced to land in that country’s capital, Minsk; two passengers—an exiled Belarusian journalist and his Russian companion—were subsequently arrested and detained. Meeting in January 2022 to consider the report of a fact-finding mission, the Council stated concern at the gaps in information submitted by Belarus, and emphasized that the pretext (a `bomb threat’) that had been used by Belarus to divert FR4978 was a deliberately false communication that had endangered the safety of an aircraft in flight. The Council directed the fact-finding team to continue its inquiries. In July the Council concluded its deliberations, and confirmed that Belarusian Government officials had deliberately relayed the false bomb threat, to orchestrate the diversion of the plane. The Council decided that the report of the fact-finding mission should be made publicly available. A subsequent determination by the Council that the Belarus regime’s actions had violated the Chicago Convention was endorsed by the 41st ICAO Assembly (which concluded in early October). In November the President of the ICAO Council briefed the UN Security Council on these developments.</p>

                    <p id="IO-CASEE.675">The ILO was founded in 1919 to work for social justice as a basis for lasting peace. It carries out this mandate by promoting decent living standards, satisfactory conditions of work and pay and adequate employment opportunities. Activities include the creation of international labour standards; the provision of technical co-operation services; and training, education, research and publishing activities to advance ILO objectives. ILO flagship programmes include the International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour and Forced Labour (IPEC+); Global Action for Prevention on Occupational Safety and Health (OSH-GAP); and Social Protection Floors for All.</p>
                    <p usage="eerca">In June 2023 the 111th session of the International Labour Conference adopted a resolution that addressed measures to secure compliance by the Belarusian authorities with ILO recommendations. Also in June, the ILO&#160;and global trade union federation IndustriAll issued a joint briefing paper that reiterated grave concerns over the Russian Federation’s imposition of forced labour conditions and use of coercion (to join Russia-based trade unions) on workers at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant (in southeastern Ukraine).</p>
                    <p usage="fea">In March 2022 the ILO’s Governing Body established a Commission of Inquiry to address non-observance by Myanmar’s military regime of fundamental ILO conventions on forced labour and on freedom of association and the right to organize.</p>

                    <p id="IO-CASEE.679">The Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization (IMCO) began operations in 1959, as a specialized agency of the UN to facilitate co-operation among governments on technical matters affecting international shipping. Its main aims are to improve the safety of international shipping, and to control pollution caused by ships. IMCO became IMO in 1982.</p>
                    <p usage="ass mena">In January 2009 a high level meeting of states from the Western Indian Ocean, the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea areas, held under IMO auspices, adopted the Djibouti Code of Conduct concerning the Repression of Piracy and Armed Robbery. Signatories to the Code agreed to co-operate lawfully in the apprehension, investigation and prosecution of people suspected of committing or facilitating acts of piracy; in the seizure of suspect vessels; in the rescue of ships, persons and property subject to acts of armed robbery; and to collaborate in the conduct of security operations. In January 2017 12 states signed the Jeddah Amendment to the Djibouti Code of Conduct, in accordance with which they were to co-operate—supported by IMO and other stakeholders—in developing national and regional capacity to address wider maritime security issues, with a focus on promoting the `blue economy’ and sustainable development of the maritime sector. By 2023 the Jeddah Amendment had 15 signatories. IMO was supporting an Indian Ocean Commission-led, European Union-sponsored Port Security and Safety of Navigation in Eastern and Southern Africa and the Indian Ocean initiative during 2020-24.</p>

           in drafting the Code of Conduct concerning the Prevention and Repression of Piracy, Armed Robbery against Ships, and Illegal Maritime Activities in West and Central Africa. This was formally adopted at a meeting of regional heads of state convened in June 2013, in Yaoundé, Cameroon, and has subsequently been referred to as the Yaoundé Code of Conduct (YCC). Implementation of the YCC is supported by a Yaoundé-based Interregional Coordination Centre.

                    <p id="IO-IOM.9933">IOM was established in 1951 as the Intergovernmental Committee for Migration (ICM), to address or­derly and planned migration meeting the specific needs of emigration and immigration countries; international resettlement; and the voluntary return and reintegration of migrants, refugees and internally displaced persons. ICM's name was changed to IOM in 1989. IOM was admitted as an observer to the UN General Assembly in 1992. In September 2016, at the UN Summit on Addressing Large Movements of Refugees and Migrants, held at the UN General Assembly, in New York, USA, IOM was incorporated into the UN system as a related body. The conference adopted the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, which recognized an unprecedented level of human mobility, and determined to address the root causes of mass migration movements. A commitment was made to negotiate a Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration. The Compact was adopted by an Intergovernmental Conference on International Migration, hosted by Morocco, in December 2018.</p>
                    <p usage="casee">IOM reported that the total number of international migrants in Europe rose from 75m. in 2015 to 87m. in 2020. In 2022 IOM recorded 189,620 irregular arrivals in Europe (40,016 by land and 149,604 by sea): Italy received 105,131, Spain 28,930, and Greece 18,775. In mid-June 2023 at least 500 migrants were believed to have drowned when a very overcrowded vessel—reportedly en route from Tobruk (Libya) to Italy, and carrying mainly people from Pakistan, Syria and Egypt—capsized off the coast of Greece; IOM and UNHCR jointly extended assistance to survivors and emphasized the international legal duty promptly to rescue people in distress at sea. In recent years the Western Balkans have became a major transit route for migrants aiming to reach Western Europe. The third Sarajevo Migration Dialogue, organized with IOM support in June 2023, in Jahorina, Bosnia and Herzegovina, adopted an Action Plan for Sustainable Migration Governance in the Western Balkans, covering the period 2023-25. A Bosnia and Herzegovina Crisis Response Plan, covering the period 2023-24, required funding of US&#8201;$64.9m., and aimed to support migrants and asylum seekers transiting through that country (mainly reported to have originated in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Burundi and Pakistan). During 2022-23, through its Displacement Tracking Matrix, IOM conducted surveys across conflict-affected Ukraine and in nearby Belarus, Hungary, Moldova, Poland, Romania and Slovakia, to inform evidence-based humanitarian actions and policy. IOM appealed for $1,000m. to fund its Ukraine and Neighbouring Countries Crisis Response Plan 2023, which aimed to support 7.2m. IDPs, former combatants, international migrants, refugees, members of affected communities and third party nationals in Ukraine and in nearby countries, including through facilitating access to quality services, and initiating early recovery activities.</p>

IDPs, former combatants, international migrants, refugees, members of affected communities and third party nationals in Ukraine and in nearby countries, including through facilitating access to quality services, and initiating early recovery activities. In June, in immediate response to a significant population displacement caused by the conflict-related destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam on the Dnipro river, in eastern Ukraine—which had led to flooding and devastation of critical infrastructure—IOM delivered supplies of clean water to evacuees. Further planned humanitarian assistance was to include the extension of sanitation support and infection control (such as through the distribution of cholera prevention kits). As at mid-2023 the DTM recorded 5.1m. IDPs across Ukraine. At that time the principal regions of origin of Ukrainian IDPs were Kharkiv and Donetsk, while most returnees were located in and around Kyiv (the national capital).</p>
                    <p usage="mena">IOM’s Yemen Crisis Response Plan 2023 required US&#160;$183m. to support 4.6m. beneficiaries, through the extension of multisectoral humanitarian assistance, and by addressing drivers of fragility, and assisting the restoration of domestic and public infrastructure. IOM has maintained a mission in Yemen and an office in Sana’a, the Yemeni capital, since 2007. The Lebanon Crisis Response Plan 2023, requiring $35m., aimed to support some 43,000 very vulnerable migrants, refugees and members of local communities, and had a focus on strengthening economic and community resilience and discouraging unsafe migration. IOM was implementing an $307.4m. initiative during 2022-23 to support 1.9m. IDPs, migrants, returnees and host communities in Iraq. Since the start of civil conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic in 2011 IOM has provided emergency relief to migrants and uprooted IDPs within that country (at a projected cost of $98.3m. in 2023) and to displaced persons in neighbouring countries. In February 2023 IOM appealed for $161m. to provide emergency assistance to 800,000 earthquake survivors in southern Türkiye and 630,000 in northwestern Syria.</p>
                    <p usage="mena">IOM and UNHCR jointly lead the UN component of an African Union-European Union-UN Tripartite Taskforce on the Situation of Migrants and Refugees in Libya (operational since early 2022). Meeting in March 2023 the Taskforce determined to strengthen efforts to support the development of non-discriminatory legal and policy frameworks for migrants and refugees in that country, and urged the Libyan authorities to end arbitrary detention of migrants and refugees. The Taskforce agreed to enhance support for voluntary humanitarian returns from Libya. IOM was implementing a US&#8201;$84.7m. Libya Crisis Response Plan during 2023.</p>

          In March 2022 IOM and the African Union (AU) signed a three-year partnership agreement under which the IOM was to assist AU member states in developing and implementing migration policies and institutional frameworks. In April 2023 IOM and the G5 Sahel concluded an agreement aimed at enhancing regional co-operation on human mobility. In the following month IOM, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, the East African Community and the Kenyan Government issued the inaugural 
          <publ-name>State of Migration in the East and Horn of Africa</publ-name>
          , which emphasized that integrated border management (including through the digitalization of processes) would ease the movement of people, goods and services throughout the region.

                    <p usage="ass">In 2023 IOM required funding of US&#8201;$58m. to support 1.2m. international migrants and members of local host communities in the framework of an inter-agency Migrant Response Plan for the Horn of Africa and Yemen. An IOM East and Horn of Africa Regional Drought Response 2023 required $257.1m., and aimed to assist 6m. beneficiaries. IOM’s South Sudan Crisis Response Plan (2023-25) aimed, at a cost of $508.4m., to assist 5.7m. people through the provision of protection, humanitarian assistance, disaster preparedness and risk reduction activities, and through investments in recovery and crisis prevention. In May 2023 IOM appealed for $209m. to provide humanitarian assistance to people displaced by the outbreak (since April) of civil conflict in Sudan: some $105m. was for assistance activities within Sudan, and $104m. for the response in nearby countries (Chad, Central African Republic, Egypt, Ethiopia, Libya and South Sudan) that were impacted by population displacement from Sudan. As at mid-2023 IOM was also implementing crisis response plans in Somalia (requiring $320.6m.), Ethiopia ($197.5m.), Democratic Republic of the Congo ($129.5m.), Niger ($114.4m.), Nigeria ($74.2m.), Chad ($51.8m.), Burundi ($41.4m.), Central African Republic ($34.4m.), Burkina Faso ($20.5m.), Mali ($19.5m.), Cameroon ($17.2m.), and Madagascar ($10m.). IOM requested funding of $30m. to contribute to Ebola Virus Disease prevention, early detection and response (from a human mobility perspective) throughout sub-Saharan Africa during 2022.</p>
                    <p usage="sasia">In March 2023 IOM appealed for US&#8201;$125.2m. to fund its Bangladesh Crisis Response Plan for that year, which aimed to support 1.4m. Rohingya refugees sheltering in 33 crowded camps in Bangladesh’s Cox’s Bazar region and members of local host communities. IOM and partners have provided the refugees with shelter; primary and emergency health care; nutritional assistance; and water, sanitation and hygiene—WASH—facilities (including by installing emergency latrines, decentralized wastewater treatment systems, earthen dams, and by boring wells). The agency has also provided camp management services, worked to improve local infrastructure, extended skills development support to migrants, and offered support to victims of gender-based violence, as well as to combat the potential trafficking of vulnerable refugees. In 2023 IOM was supporting nine Women’s and Girls’ Safe Spaces at Cox’s Bazar. In response to a severe fire at Cox’s Bazar in March 2023, destroying around 12,000 shelters, IOM and partners supplied emergency food, non-food items and access to cooking facilities, and support with shelter reconstruction. IOM’s Pakistan Crisis Response Plan covering 2023-25 aimed to support 13.7m. natural disaster-affected IDPs, migrants and local communities, at a cost of $259.5m.</p>
                    <p usage="sasia">A US&#8201;$347.2m. Afghanistan and Neighbouring Countries Crisis Response Plan 2023, which was under development in June of that year, was being designed to support 955,980 people. From early 2023 IOM supported the travel arrangements of expatriate Afghan girls who had enrolled at an Afghan-led boarding institution: the School of Leadership, Afghanistan (SOLA), which relocated to Rwanda following the imposition by the Taliban authorities (that usurped power in Afghanistan in August 2021) of a ban on girls’ secondary education.</p>
                    <p usage="fea">Under a US $37.2m. Myanmar Crisis Response Plan IOM aimed to support 618,000 local beneficiaries in 2023, through the extension of essential multi-sectoral assistance and by strengthening local response and recovery capacities. A $125.2m. Bangladesh Crisis Response Plan for that year aimed to support 1.4m. Myanma Rohingya Muslim refugees sheltering in 33 crowded camps in Bangladesh’s Cox’s Bazar region and members of local host communities. A $54.9m. Philippines Crisis Response Plan 2023 was targeting support at 540,000 internal and international migrants, IDPs, local host communities, and former combatants. IOM was also implementing a $21.9m. South Pacific Islands Crisis Response Plan (2023-25) and a $33.3m. North Pacific Islands Crisis Response Plan (2021-23), both of which aimed to strengthen regional disaster management.</p>
                    <p usage="sacac">IOM, in co-ordination with UNHCR and partner agencies has monitored the situation of large mixed migration flows (`caravans’) of migrants from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador aiming to reach the Mexico-USA border. (It has been reported that such mass mobilizations ensure greater security and visibility for migrants along potentially dangerous routes.) The agency has helped provide the migrants with basic support, including food, hygiene kits and, where required, voluntary returns assistance. IOM’s Regional Strategy for North America, Central America and the Caribbean, covering the period 2020-24, focused on addressing adverse factors that were driving migration; facilitating safe, regular and orderly forms of migration; and effective advocacy for migrants. In 2022 an estimated 686 migrants died or disappeared attempting to cross the Mexico-USA border.</p>
                    <p usage="sacac">IOM’s Caribbean Environmental Resilience and Disaster Displacement Response Plan, covering the period 2022-24, required US&#8201;$33.5m. to support 490,470 people who were identified as being at risk of displacement through natural disasters. During 2022-24 IOM and partners were implementing a $316.6m. Haiti Crisis Response Plan, targeting 1.1m. beneficiaries, with a focus on tackling the root causes of irregular migration, building community resilience to identified risks and reducing forced population flows, mainstreaming migration issues into the development agenda, and improving the capacities of national institutions to manage migration dynamics. In June 2023 IOM reported that more than 165,000 people were displaced within Haiti as a consequence of gang violence.</p>
                    <p usage="sacac">An IOM-UNHCR-led regional Refugee and Migrant Response Plan (RMRP) for 2023-24 aimed to assist, through protection, humanitarian, and socioeconomic integration activities, around 3.4m. people, including migrants in transit, those making pendular movements between Venezuela and Colombia, Colombian returnees, and members of host communities receiving Venezuelan refugees. During 2023 the RMRP required funding from the international community totalling US&#8201;$1,720m. IOM’s Colombia Crisis Response Plan for 2023-24 required $51.2m. to support 345,930 migrants, IDPs, local communities, and former combatants. A notable rise in the use by migrants in the region of informal border crossings and dangerous routes was observed in 2022. Of nearly 250,000 migrants who were reported to have travelled across the hazardous Darién jungle in the Colombia-Panama border zone in 2022—almost double the number of crossings made in 2021—150,327 were Venezuelans; 141 migrants died on that route in 2022.</p>

                    <p usage="ass">In addition to numerous nature reserves and national parks, examples in Africa include Mbanza Kongo—vestiges of the political and spiritual capital of the former Kingdom of Kongo (Angola); the royal palaces of Abomey (Benin); the Tsodilo rock art site (Botswana); the ancient ferrous metallurgy sites at Douroula, Tiwêga, Yamané, Kindibo and Békuy (Burkina Faso); the Ennedi Massif: Natural and Cultural Landscape (Chad); Sudanese style adobe mosques in northern Côte d’Ivoire; the Modernist African City of Asmara (Eritrea); the rock-hewn churches at Lalibela (Ethiopia); forts, castles and Ashanti traditional buildings in Ghana; Lamu Old Town, and the Thimlich Ohinga Archaeological Site (a dry-stoned wall settlement dating from around the 16th century) (Kenya); the Royal Hill of Ambohimanga (Madagascar); the Chongoni rock art area (Malawi); the Bandiagara cliffs of the Dogon people (Mali); four ancient trading towns in Mauritania; Le Morne Cultural Landscape (Mauritius); the historic centre of Agadez (Niger); the Sukur Cultural Landscape (Nigeria); the megalithic stone circles of Senegambia (Senegal/Gambia); Robben Island and the Mapungubwe Cultural Landscape (South Africa); the pyramids at Gebel Barkal and other archaeological sites in the Napatan region (Sudan); the stone town of Zanzibar (Tanzania); and Great Zimbabwe National Monument. In 2023 the list of World Heritage in Danger included four national parks and reserves in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC); the Niokolo-Koba National Park in Senegal; the Selous Game Reserve in Tanzania; the tombs of Buganda Kings at Kasubi, Uganda; the Rainforests of the Atsinanana in Madagascar; and (owing to conflict in northern Mali) the old town of Djenné and four neighbouring archaeological sites, and the city of Tombouctou and the Tomb of Askia (dating from 1495, and situated in Gao). In July 2017 the World Heritage Committee removed the Simien National Park (Ethiopia) from the list of sites in danger; similarly, the DRC’s Salonga National Park was removed in July 2021. Lake Turkana National Parks, in Kenya, were added to that list in 2018, in view of concerns over the impact of the Gilgel Gibe III Dam (on the Omo River, in Ethiopia) on Lake Turkana’s flow and ecosystem, and also over threats to the lake posed by Ethiopia’s Kuraz Sugar Development Project.</p>
                    <p usage="mena">Examples of World Heritage sites include: the ruins of Persepolis (Iran); the ruins of ancient Babylon (Iraq); the archaeological sites of Troy (Türkiye); and the Old City of Sana'a (Yemen).</p>

In recent years UNESCO has been increasingly concerned about the use of trafficking in looted cultural property as a means of directly financing terrorist activities. In November 2017 UNESCO and the International Criminal Court adopted a Letter of Intent that formalized co-operation between the two organizations in combating the deliberate destruction of cultural heritage.</p>
                    <p usage="mena">A UNESCO observatory was established in Beirut, Lebanon, in July 2014 to monitor and assess the state of Syria’s cultural heritage. In August 2015 the UNESCO Director-General declared as a war crime the destruction of Baalshamin temple at Palmyra, Syria by Islamic State militants. In April 2016 a team of experts completed a rapid assessment of the state of the museum and archeological site at Palmyra, some of which remained inaccessible. The mission identified a series of emergency measures aimed at securing the museum from the Islamic State ­insurgency. In January 2017 the UNESCO Director-General condemned the destruction of further parts of the Palmyra site as a war crime. In that month a UNESCO emergency mission was dispatched to Aleppo to undertake a preliminary assessment of conflict-related damage to cultural sites and education institutions there. This found that some 60% of the old city of Aleppo had been severely damaged and that around 30% had been destroyed. In July 2014 the UNESCO Director-General condemned the recent destruction by Islamic State militants of the tomb and mosque of Prophet Jonas in Mosul, Iraq, and demanded that the ongoing intentional destruction of Iraqi religious and cultural heritage should cease. In that month UNESCO approved an Emergency Response Action Plan aimed at safeguarding Iraq’s cultural heritage. In August the Director-General demanded the immediate cessation of `emerging cultural cleansing’ in northern Iraq, manifested in attacks against members of religious and ethnic minorities. Following attacks perpetrated in February 2015 by terrorists against Mosul Museum and various archaeological sites in the Nineveh region, as well as book burnings in Mosul, UNESCO welcomed the adoption, in May, of a UN General Resolution on `Saving the Cultural Heritage of Iraq’. In February 2018 UNESCO initiated the flagship programme `Revive the Spirit of Mosul’, with a particular focus on the human dimension of reconstruction. Under the programme UNESCO was co-ordinating the restoration and rehabilitation of cultural heritage, and of educational and cultural institutions. An estimated 80% of projects had been completed by July 2023.</p>

At mid-2023 there were 90 biosphere reserves in 33 countries in Africa, including Doumba-Rey (Cameroon), Sena Oura (Chad), Kafue Flats (Zambia), and Middle Zambezi (Zimbabwe), all of which had been newly designated in June of that year. Ngorongoro Lengai in Tanzania, designated by UNESCO as a Global Geopark, is noted for its great diversity of wildlife—coexisting with human settlements, and for the Oldoinyo Lengai (`Mountain of God’ in the local Masai language) active stratovolcano.</p>

                    <p id="IO-CASEE.688">The General Postal Union was founded by the Treaty of Bern (1874), beginning operations in July 1875. Three years later its name was changed to the Universal Postal Union. In 1948 UPU became a specialized agency of the UN.

          In March 2006 the UN Security Council adopted a resolution requesting the UN Secretary-General to negotiate with the Lebanese Government on the establishment of an international tribunal to try those suspected of involvement in a terrorist attack that, in February 2005, had killed 22 people, including the former Prime Minister of Lebanon, Rafik Hariri. The resulting agreement on the Special Tribunal for Lebanon was endorsed by the Security Council in May 2007. The Tribunal, which became operational on 1 March 2009, and was terminated on 31 December 2023, comprised both international and Lebanese judges and applied Lebanese (not international) law. On its establishment the Tribunal took over the mandate of a terminated UN International Independent Investigation Commission, which had been created by a resolution of the Security Council in April 2005 to gather evidence and assist the Lebanese authorities in their investigation into the February 2005 attacks, and whose mandate had later been expanded to investigate other assassinations that had occurred before and after the attack. A Defence Office was established within the Tribunal to protect the rights of the suspects, accused and their counsel. In January 2011 the Prosecutor submitted to the Pre-Trial Judge an indictment of four suspects—Salim Jamil Ayyash, Mustafa Amine Badreddine, Hussein Hassan Oneissi and Assad Hassan Sabra (`Ayyash 
          <i>et al.</i>
          ’)—on charges of conspiracy to commit a terrorist act, in relation to the February 2005 atrocities. The indictment was confirmed in June 2011. In that month the Tribunal passed to the Lebanese authorities arrest warrants for the four suspects. The Tribunal determined in February 2012 to try the four accused in the case 
          <i>in absentia</i>
          , on the grounds that they had apparently absconded. In July 2013 it was confirmed that a sealed indictment had been submitted by the Prosecutor against Hassan Habib Merhi, who was also accused of involvement in the February 2005 attack. In December 2013 the Trial Chamber ruled that Merhi should also be tried 
          <i>in absentia</i>
          . Trial proceedings in the case Ayyash 
          <i>et al.</i>
           opened in January 2014, without the presence of the defendants, who had continued to evade arrest. In February the Chamber ruled that the Merhi case should be amalgamated into that of Ayyash 
          <i>et al.</i>
           In July 2016 the Appeals Chamber found that sufficient evidence had been presented to the Tribunal to assume that the accused Mustafa Amine Badreddine had died, and thus ordered the Trial Chamber to terminate the proceedings against him, without prejudice to resume them should evidence subsequently be presented that he was alive. In August 2017 the presentation of evidence on behalf of 72 victims of the February 2005 terrorist attack commenced in the Ayyash 
          <i>et al.</i>
           trial. This represented the first ever presentation of evidence by victims of terrorism to an international tribunal. The closing arguments of the prosecution, defence and legal representatives of victims in the Ayyash 
          <i>et al.</i>
           case were concluded in September 2018. On 18 August 2020 the Court issued its final judgment. Salim Jamil Ayyash was unanimously pronounced to be guilty beyond all reasonable doubt of being a co-perpetrator of: conspiracy to commit a terrorist act; committing a terrorist act by deploying an explosive device; the intentional premeditated homicide of Rafik Hariri, using explosive materials; the intentional premeditated homicide of an additional 21 people using explosive materials; and the attempted intentional premeditated homicide of 226 others using explosive materials. Hassan Habib Merhi, Hussein Hassan Oneissi and Assad Hassan Sabra were acquitted. In December Ayyash was sentenced to five concurrent terms of life imprisonment. In January 2021 the Defence Counsel for Ayyash filed an appeal against the guilty verdict and sentence. On 29 March the Tribunal’s Appeals Chamber ruled that the Ayyash Defence was not entitled to appeal the conviction in the absence of Ayyash himself. In the same month the Prosecutor filed an appeal against the Judgment concerning Hassan Habib Merhi and Hussein Hassan Oneissi. In March 2022 the Appeals Chamber ruled to reverse the 2020 acquittals, convicted them of conspiracy to commit terrorist acts, and issued warrants for their arrest. Both men were sentenced 
          <i>in absentia</i>
           to life imprisonment by the Appeals Chamber in June 2022; the Prosecutor reiterated demands for their surrender, and for support by the international community to secure their arrest.
        </p>
                    <p usage="edio mena">In August 2011 the Tribunal also established jurisdiction in the cases concerning terrorist attacks perpetrated on 1 October 2004 against Marwan Hamadeh, on 21 June 2005 against George Hawi, and on 12 July 2005 against Elias el-Murr; accordingly the Lebanese authorities were ordered to transfer to the Tribunal all material relevant to these cases. These three cases were not, however, completed.</p>

                    <p usage="edio mena">
          In mid-September 2019 the Tribunal removed confidentiality from a decision that had been made to indict Salim Jamil Ayyash in an additional case on charges (including conspiracy to commit a terrorist act and intentional homicide with premeditation) that related to the three attacks perpetrated during late 2004-mid-2005. Related national and international arrest warrants were issued against Ayyash forthwith. On 24 September the President of the Special Tribunal ordered that the new indictment against Ayyash—who had not been directly contactable—should be publicized in an alternate manner, including through public advertisement. If within 30 days no contact had been made (it was not), the Trial Chamber was to be asked to initiate relevant proceeding 
          <i>in absentia</i>
          . In September 2020 the Trial Chamber confirmed the Special Tribunal's jurisdiction to try Ayyash (the `Ayyash case’) in relation to the three attacks covered by the indictment; in February 2021 it was announced that the trial would, provisionally, commence in June. At the start of June the Trial Chamber cancelled the commencement of the trial and suspended all decisions on filings relating to the case, as a result of the Tribunal’s severe financial situation.

                    <p usage="edio mena">
          On 31 January 2014 the Special Tribunal issued a Contempt Decision (made public in late April), in accordance with which contempt of court proceedings were initiated against two Lebanese journalists and two news corporations in that country, that were accused of having published the names of individuals alleged to be witnesses before the Tribunal. The 2014 Contempt Decision represented the first incidence under international criminal law of corporate entities being charged with contempt of court; the admissibility of proceedings against corporations was upheld by the Appeals Chamber in October, although remained disputed by the Contempt Judge. In September 2015 the Contempt Judge acquitted one journalist of both counts in the case, and the other of one count. In July the Judge found two further accused guilty of knowingly and wilfully interfering with the administration of justice by disseminating information on apparent confidential witnesses in the Ayyash 
          <i>et al.</i>
           case; punitive fines were imposed in August.

                    <p id="HYBRIDINTCC.IO.22">Formally established as the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia for the Prosecution of Crimes Committed during the Period of Democratic Kampuchea (17 April 1975-6 January 1979), the ECCC was inaugurated in July 2006 on the basis of an agreement concluded in June 2003 between the Cambod­ian Government and the UN. The ECCC is mandated to prosecute senior leaders of the former Khmer Rouge regime for serious contraventions of Cambod­ian and international law—including crimes against humanity, genocide and war crimes—committed during the period 17 April 1975-6 January 1979. The ECCC is a hybrid Cambod­ian tribunal with international participation, incorporating Cambod­ian and international judges and personnel. It applies international standards and acts independently of the Cambod­ian Government and the UN. The ECCC comprises a Pre-Trial Chamber, Trial Chamber and Supreme Court Chamber; an Office of the Co-Prosecutors; an Office of the Co-Investigating Judges; a Defence Support section; a Victims' Unit; and an Office of Administration. Victims may file complaints before the ECCC, and may apply to become Civil Parties to the proceedings. In October 2011 the Court’s then International Co-Investigating Judge resigned, citing attempted interference by government officials in the investigation into Cases 003 and 004. His successor submitted his resignation on similar grounds in March 2012. A new International Co-Investigating Judge was appointed in July of that year. In February 2013 the Court determined to annul a previous ruling that had hitherto prevented the prosecution of alleged crimes of conflict-related sexual violence committed under the Khmer Rouge regime, such as rape, sexual slavery, and also forced marriage—which had allegedly been employed systematically with a view to severing traditional family bonds and manipulating citizens’ loyalties. On 1 January 2023 the ECCC entered a residual phase, initially scheduled to last for three years, during which its functions included the enforcement of sentences, protection of victims and witnesses, and management of records and archives. An ECCC Resource Centre was initiated in September 2023. The ECCC’s proposed budget for 2023 totalled US&#8201;$6m.</p>

           In February 2009 the ECCC initiated proceedings (`Case 001') against its first defendant, Kaing Guek Eav (also known as Duch), who had been charged under international law with crimes against humanity and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, and under Cambod­ian national law with homicide and torture offences, in relation to his former role as director of Tuol Sleng (`S-21’) security centre, where at least 15,000 prisoners had been tortured and executed. In July 2010 Kaing Guek Eav was found guilty and sentenced to 35 years’ imprisonment; in February 2012, following an appeal in that case, lodged in March 2011, Kaing Guek Eav’s sentence was increased to life imprisonment. He died incarcerated in September 2020.

                         <b>Case 002:</b>
           In September 2010 four other senior figures in the Khmer Rouge regime (Nuon Chea, formerly the Deputy Secretary of the Party of Democratic Kampuchea; Ieng Sary, formerly Minister of Foreign Affairs; Khieu Samphan, formerly President of the State Presidium; and Ieng Thirith, formerly Minister of Social Affairs and Action) were indicted on charges of crimes against humanity, grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, genocide, and offences under the Cambodian criminal code (`Case 002'). Ieng Sary died in detention, of natural causes, in March 2013, and Ieng Thirith (who had been released in view of a diagnosis of clinical dementia) died in August 2015. In January 2011 a Pre-Trial Chamber ordered the case to be sent for trial. In September the Trial Chamber issued a Severance Order mandating the division of Case 002 into a series of smaller trials, to be tried and adjudicated separately. In February 2012, following an appeal by the Prosecutor, the Supreme Court Chamber annulled the September 2011 Severance Order issued by the Trial Chamber, on the grounds that the scope of Case 002/01 as defined by the Trial Chamber was not representative of the charges contained in the overall indictment. In April 2013 the Trial Chamber issued a second Severance Order that limited the scope of Case 002/01 to the forced evacuation of Phnom Penh in April 1975, the execution of former Lon Nol soldiers at the Toul Po Chreu execution site in Pursat immediately after the Khmer Rouge rose to power in 1975, and the second phase of the forced movement of population that was initiated in September 1975. Remaining charges under Case 002 were deferred to subsequent trials. In May 2013 Nuon Chea and both Co-Prosecutors filed an appeal against the Trial Chamber's Second Severance Order relating to Case 002; in July, however, this was dismissed by the Supreme Court Chamber. At that time the Supreme Court Chamber decreed that Case 002/02 should include, at a minimum, charges relating to the S-21 security centre, and also to a Khmer Rouge worksite, a co-operative, and to genocide. In August 2014 both Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea were found guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced to life terms of imprisonment. The Supreme Court upheld the life sentences in November 2016. Hearings in Case 002/02 commenced in September 2015. In February 2017 the potential scope of Case 002 against Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea was reduced, on the grounds that facts already presented to the Court sufficiently represented the totality of their crimes. In February 2018 the Trial Chamber deemed that the elderly Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea, who had recently been examined by medical specialists, remained fit to stand trial in Case 002/02. In mid-November both men were found guilty—through their acts and omissions—of genocide, grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions and crimes against humanity committed during 1977-79. Nuon Chea died (of natural causes) in August 2019. An ECCC special panel rejected in July 2020 an attempt by Khieu Samphan to have the previous judgments against him dismissed; in September 2022 a formal appeal by Khieu Samphan was rejected; the appeal judgment was certified as final on 23 December. In January 2023 the Co-Prosecutors requested that Khieu Samphan be transferred from the ECCC’s detention facility to Kandal Provincial Prison (south of Phnom Penh).

                         <b>Cases 003/004:</b>
           In September 2009 the International Prosecutor requested a formal judicial investigation into two further cases (`Case 003' and `Case 004'), also relating to alleged atrocities committed during the Period of Democratic Kampuchea. In April 2011 the Co-Investigating Judges notified the Co-Prosecutors of the conclusion of the investigation into Case 003; the investigation was, however, subsequently re-opened, and in March 2015 Meas Muth (a former naval commander) was charged 
          <i>in absentia</i>
           with homicide, grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, and crimes against humanity allegedly committed at Kampong Som, Kratie, Wat Enta Nhien security centre, S-21 security centre, and against Thai, Vietnamese, other foreigners at sea, and on islands over which Democratic Kampuchea claimed sovereignty. In December 2015 Yim Tith was charged by the International Co-Investigating Judge, under Case 004; he was accused of perpetrating genocide against people of Khmer Krom ethnicity, crimes against humanity, grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, and violations of the 1956 Cambodian Penal Code. On 31 May and 4 June 2018, respectively, the National and International Co-Prosecutors filed separate Final Submissions regarding Yim Tith: the National Co-Prosecutor considered that the case against him should be dismissed (citing as grounds that he had not been a senior, most responsible Khmer Rouge leader and so was not subject to the personal jurisdiction of the ECCC), meanwhile the International Co-Prosecutor concluded that proceedings against Yim Tith should continue. In March 2015 Im Chaem (a former district official) was charged 
          <i>in absentia</i>
           under Case 004 with homicide and crimes against humanity allegedly perpetrated at the Phnom Trayoung security centre; in February 2016 proceedings against Im Chaem were severed from Case 004, and it was announced that they would be considered separately, as Case 004/1. In February 2017 the Co-Investigating Judges issued a closing order to dismiss proceedings against Im Chaem, on the grounds that—as a Khmer Rouge official without senior status—she was not subject to the ECCC’s personal jurisdiction; an appeal against the closing order was filed by the International Co-Prosecutor in July; in June 2018 a Pre-Trial Chamber issued its considerations on the International Co-Prosecutor’s appeal: it concluded unanimously that various procedural defects had occurred, and ruled that the decision to end proceedings against Im Chaem should prevail; Case 004/1 was therefore concluded at that time. In March 2015 former Khmer Rouge official Ao An (also known as Ta An) was charged under Case 004 with premeditated murder, extermination, persecution on political and religious grounds, imprisonment, and other inhumane acts, that he had allegedly perpetrated at the Kok Pring execution site, and at the Tuol Beng and Wat Au Trakuon security centres; further charges against Ao An, relating, 
          <i>inter alia</i>
          , to genocide of the Cham community, other acts of murder, and enslavement, were announced in March 2016. In December the Co-Investigating Judges severed the proceedings against Ao An from Case 004, creating Case 004/02. In August 2018 the Co-Investigating Judges issued two separate closing orders relating to the Ao An case, owing to failure between them to agree on whether Ao An was subject to the ECCC’s personal jurisdiction (the National Co-Investigating Judge considered that he was not, while the International Co-Investigating Judge believed Ao An to be one of the most responsible Khmer Rouge perpetrators, and considered that sufficient evidence had been submitted to indict Ao An on charges related, 
          <i>inter alia</i>
          , to crimes against humanity and the genocide of the ethnic Cham). Likewise, in November the Co-Investigating Judges issued separate conflicting closing orders relating to the Meas Muth case. In December 2019 the Pre-Trial Chamber issued a ruling on the Ao An case which failed definitively to resolve whether or not it should proceed to trial—with the Chamber’s two international judges advocating for the immediate transferral of the case to trial on the charges laid out in the indictment, and the three Cambodian judges advocating for it to be dismissed. In August 2020 the Supreme Chamber of the ECCC terminated the case against Ao An, on the grounds that no agreement had hitherto been reached on whether he was subject to the ECCC’s jurisdiction. Subsequently the Co-Investigating Judges jointly ordered that case 004/02 should be sealed and archived. In April 2021, ruling on the Co-Investigating Judges’ (2018) conflicting closing orders on the Meas Muth case, the five Pre-Trial Chamber Judges stated that the Co-Investigating Judges’ agreement to issue separate closing orders was illegal under the ECCC’s legal framework; a supermajority decision was not achieved on whether either or both of the controversial closing orders should be upheld or dismissed; in December 2021 the Supreme Chamber of the ECCC terminated Case 003 against Meas Muth, on the grounds that there was no enforceable indictment, and the Co-Investigating Judges subsequently unanimously ordered that Case 003 should be sealed and archived; likewise, in the absence of an enforceable indictment, Case 004 against Yim Tith was also terminated, and sealed and archived, in December.
