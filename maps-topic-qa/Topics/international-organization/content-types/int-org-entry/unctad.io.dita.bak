      In October 2021 the 15th session of the Conference, with participation by representatives of &#160;governments, UN agencies and global financial institutions, adopted the Bridgetown Covenant, which set out a roadmap to guide the transformation of economies through diversification; resolving unsustainable debt burdens in developing countries; improving development financing; fostering more sustainable and resilient economies; and revising the functioning of multilateralism. The need to reinvigorate UNCTAD’s role as an intergovernmental mechanism to support activities relating to trade and development, including finance, technology, investment and the achievement of the 
      <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-UNDP.001">UN Sustainable Development Goals</xr>

       The 2024 edition of the report, issued in January, emphasized that the global economy was confronting multiple crises, with geopolitical tensions and mounting extreme weather events exacerbating underlying vulnerabilities, and tight financial conditions also posing risks to industrial production and global trade. It forecast that growth in global output would decelerate from an estimated 2.7% 2023 to 2.4% in 2024.

        UNCTAD works to promote policies and strategies at national and international level, and analyses issues related to globalization, interdependence, international trade and finance, in support of economic management for sustainable development. UNCTAD publishes an annual 
        <publ-name>Trade and Development Report (TDR),</publ-name>
         which analyses current economic trends and major international policy issues. The 2023 
        <publ-name>TDR,</publ-name>
         issued in October, warned that the global economy had reached a crossroads, characterized by divergent growth paths, widening inequalities, deepening debt burdens and growing market concentration. The report recommended global financial reforms; pragmatic policies aimed at curbing inflation, inequality and sovereign debt distress (including boosting concessional lending); and keener oversight of key markets.

         issued in 2012, detail the core responsibilities of lenders and borrowers of sovereign debt. Through its Debt Management and Financial Analysis System, a joint programme with the World Bank, UNCTAD provides assistance to developing countries on debt management, helping debtor countries to analyse data, make projections, and plan strategies for debt repayment and reorganization with the help of modern information technology. In 2024 the programme was supporting 60 countries and 85 institutions. UNCTAD organizes biennial Debt Management Conferences; the 13th was held in December 2022, in Geneva. It also provides training for operators and senior officials to raise awareness of institutional reforms that might be necessary for effective debt management. UNCTAD supports developing countries in their negotiations on debt owed to developed countries' governments, in the context of the Common Debt Framework of the Paris Club of creditor nations, and every year it provides a report on the external debt of developing countries to the UN General Assembly. UNCTAD also researches and analyses debt transparency, and advocates for the creation of a public registry of debt data for developing countries. It maintains the World of Debt Dashboard, which provides overviews of public debt and development spending indicators at national level, and facilitates international comparisons.
      </p>
               <p>UNCTAD serves as a global centre of excellence in managing trade data, statistics and related analytical software, and maintains the UNCTADStat database, comprising data collected, and regularly updated, from national economies and international sources. It supports national statistical agencies in developing and transition countries with data collection and dissemination efforts.</p>

               <p>The Division on International Trade and Commodities monitors and assesses trends in the international trading system from a development perspective, with a view to maximizing development gains. Among other activities, each year UNCTAD prepares an assessment of key developments in the international trading system for consideration and deliberation by the Trade and Development Board and the UN General Assembly, supports international trade and trade negotiations, and provides assistance to developing countries in strengthening regional integration and in navigating the development dimension of the international trading system. It helps to administer the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) agreements, and promotes South-South trade, including through trade finance, and through servicing the 1989 Global System of Trade Preferences among Developing Countries (GSTP) Agreement. UNCTAD aims to increase the participation of developing countries in global services trade and in new and dynamic global sectors, including creative products and industries.</p>
               <p>UNCTAD is the UN’s focal point of work on both competition policy and consumer protection, and the interface between competition and consumer policies has been a special area of focus. Countries are helped to establish competition policies and laws, and to develop voluntary norms to combat anti-competitive practices in national and global markets. Developing countries are also helped to design policies and strategies to strengthen their competitive productive capacities and trade-related infrastructures. In December 2015, based on a review overseen by UNCTAD, the UN General Assembly adopted updated UN Guidelines for Consumer Protection, reflecting new developments in the global economy, including the dominance of e-commerce. (The original version of the non-binding Guidelines had been introduced in 1985.) The eighth meeting of UNCTAD’s Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Consumer Protection Law and Policy, established to oversee the implementation of the 2015 Guidelines, was to be held in July 2024. A UN Conference to review the set of multilaterally agreed equitable principles and rules for the control of restrictive business practices is held under UNCTAD auspices at five-yearly intervals. The eighth session, convened in October 2020, incorporated for the first time a review of the guidelines on consumer protection. In June 2023 UNCTAD initiated an updated online Productive Capacities Index (PCI), providing tools to enable policymakers to measure national performance in harnessing entrepreneurial capabilities, productive resources and production linkages.</p>

         (ITC), based in Geneva, Switzerland, which helps developing countries and countries with economies in transition to achieve sustainable human development through the export of goods and services. In March 2014 UNCTAD and the ITC signed a Memorandum of Understanding on jointly assisting developing countries in the implementation of the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement (which entered into force in February 2017). In April 2016 UNCTAD and the World Bank Group determined to enhance co-operation to promote trade, growth and competitiveness in developing countries. UNCTAD and the five UN Regional Commissions undertook the fifth UN Global Survey on Digital and Sustainable Trade Facilitation, during January-June 2023, and subsequently issued a report that presented analysis of the implementation of 60 trade facilitation measures in more than 160 countries worldwide.

        UNCTAD supports countries to diversify and to strengthen non-commodity economic activities, with a view to reducing over-reliance on fluctuating commodity markets. A country is deemed by UNCTAD to be `commodity-dependent’ if primary commodities represent more than 60% of its total merchandise exports. Commodity-dependent developing countries (CDDCs) are particularly vulnerable to negative market shocks. The 2023 edition of UNCTAD’s biennial 
        <publ-name>State of Commodity Dependence</publ-name>
        , issued in June, found that during 2019-21 101 UNCTAD member states were commodity-dependent; of these, 95 were CDDCs. In October the 2023 edition of UNCTAD’s biennial 
        <publ-name>Commodities and Development Report</publ-name>
         provided a blueprint for the implementation of green industrial policies, including harnessing the potential of solar, wind and other renewable energy sources. Mineral-rich CDDCs were advised to exploit the economic potential of the ongoing surge in global demand for critical minerals such as lithium and cobalt (used in green technologies)—while avoiding a new `commodity trap’. The report recommended that they integrate mining activities with domestic or regional value chains, and uphold environmental and social governance standards. Agriculture-dependent countries were advised, 
        <i>inter alia,</i>
         to promote local processing to add value to crops prior to exportation (for example, through the local manufacture of refined chocolate from raw cocoa beans). In December, during the inaugural Trade Day at the 28th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNCTAD helped to organize a session on `Critical minerals, the energy transition and the role of trade’.

        In March 2022 UNCTAD was appointed to co-ordinate a Task Team on Food, Energy and Finance within the UN’s high-level Global Crisis Response Group that was established to address the broad global impacts of the war in Ukraine. The 2023 edition of UNCTAD’s biennial 
        <publ-name>Trade and Environment Review</publ-name>
        , issued in May, addressed the impacts of the ongoing conflict, as well as other global crises, and of human activity on ocean-focused sectors including fishing, seafood, coastal tourism and shipping. It urged the adoption of a Blue Deal aimed at promoting the sustainable use of oceans, and increased investment in seaweed farming and in the development of substitutes for (ocean-polluting) plastics.

         jointly organized the second Illicit Trade Forum (the first having been held in February 2020), in Geneva, to consider means of curbing illicit trade in times of crisis (which often generate opportunities for uncontrolled profit-making and exploitation); as well as illicit trade in falsified medicines and the maritime transport sector; and means of controlling illicit financial flows. At that time UNCTAD estimated that illicit trade was depriving governments of around US&#8201;$2,000,000,000m. annually.

        UNCTAD acts as the focal point of the UN system on matters related to investment, and promotes the understanding of key issues, particularly matters related to foreign direct investment (FDI) and enterprise development. The Division on Investment and Enterprise also assists developing countries, in particular LDCs and countries with special needs, in formulating and implementing active policies aimed at boosting productive capacities and international competitiveness and in participating more fully in international investment agreements (IIAs). In order to accomplish this objective, the Division carries out research and policy analysis on the development impact of FDI in the areas of IIAs, national FDI policies, intellectual property, and enterprise development and business facilitation. UNCTAD’s online Investment Policy Hub includes tools for policymakers, such as UNCTAD’s Investment Policy Framework for Sustainable Development (launched in 2012 and updated in 2015), Investment Policy Reviews (IPRs), Investment Policy Monitors, and navigators on investment laws, agreements and dispute settlements. UNCTAD also assists developing countries in implementing the recommendations of IPRs. A regional IPR on the

         provides data and analysis on issues pertaining to FDI and transnational corporations. The 2023 WIR, released in July, noted a decline in FDI in 2022 of 12% globally and of 37% in developing countries, attributed to the overlapping crises of the war in Ukraine, elevated food and energy costs, and high public debt. The report also observed that developing countries were receiving less than one-third of their renewable energy investment requirements (although globally such investments had increased threefold since 2015, developed countries had been the principal recipients). In January 2024 UNCTAD’s 
        <publ-name>Global Investment Trends Monitor</publ-name>
         found that FDI had increased by 3% globally in 2023; however, growth was focused narrowly on a small number of European so-called `conduit’ economies, and in developing countries FDI had fallen by 9% (with developing countries in Asia particularly adversely affected).

UNCTAD is a founding member of the Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development, which aims to define and harmonize internationally comparable ICT indicators. An e-Trade for All initiative was launched in July 2016, at UNCTAD’s 14th session, by a broad consortium of development agencies. In February 2020 UNCTAD issued a Business-to-Consumer E-commerce Index, which ranked 152 countries according to the strength of their engagement in online commerce. UNCTAD's

        , published in September, estimated a 32.4% increase in global maritime trade in that year. In January 2024, however, UNCTAD warned that mounting attacks against shipping in the Red Sea, compounded by continuing geopolitical tensions disrupting Black Sea shipping, and impacts of climate change on the Panama Canal (i.e. extreme drought and falling water levels), were forming a complex crisis affecting key trade routes.

                    <p>
          UNCTAD aims to focus particular attention on the needs of the world's (in 2024) 45 LDCs, the large majority of which are in Africa, and which comprise around 12% of the global population but account for less than 2% of global GDP. The LDCs (formally designated as such by the 
          <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-UN.ECOSOC.3">UN Committee for Development Policy</xr>
          ) are characterized as low-income nations impeded by severe structural impediments to sustainable development, and highly vulnerable to economic and environmental shocks. UNCTAD is a partner in the Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF) for trade-related assistance to LDCs, which was initiated in 2009 to promote greater participation by LDCs in the global trading system. In 2018 the EIF launched a Trade for Development News service. In June of that year a Gebze, Türkiye-based Technology Bank for LDCs was inaugurated, tasked with broadening the application of innovation, science and technology in, and serving as a knowledge hub for LDCs. Five UN Conferences on LDCs have been convened under UNCTAD auspices. At the first part of LDC V, held in March 2022, in New York, USA, the Doha Programme of Action (DPoA) for LDCs was adopted. Endorsed in April by the UN General Assembly, the DPoA set out a roadmap for strengthening commitments between LDCs and development partners during the period 2022-31, with a focus on the following six pillars: (i) Investing in people in LDCs; (ii) Leveraging the power of science, technology, and innovation to combat multidimensional vulnerabilities and achieve the SDGs; (iii) Supporting structural transformation as a driver of prosperity; (iv) Enhancing LDCs’ international trade and regional integration; (v) Addressing climate change, environmental degradation and post-pandemic recovery, and building resilience against future shocks (to facilitate risk-informed sustainable development); and (vi) Mobilizing international solidarity, reinvigorated global partnerships, and innovative tools and instruments. In accordance with the DPoA an investment support centre for LDCs was to be established, and—to advance engineering, technology and mathematics education in LDCs and in countries that have recently graduated from that status—feasibility studies were to be undertaken on the future development of an online university or equivalent learning platform. The final session of LDC V, held in Doha (Qatar), in March 2023, focused on constructing plans and partnerships to underpin the delivery of the DPoA. UNCTAD’s 
          <publ-name>Least Developed Countries Report 2023,</publ-name>
           issued in November of that year, called for the global community urgently to address LDCs’ critical financial challenges, including through a lasting, multilateral solution to LDCs’ debt, and through the mobilization of requisite climate and development finance.
        </p>
                    <p>
          In order to graduate from LDC status countries are required to meet at least two of three thresholds relating to gross national income per capita, the Human Assets Index and the Economic Vulnerability Index (the two indexes are maintained by the 
          <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-UN.ECOSOC.3">UN Committee for Development Policy</xr>
          ); or to at least double the GNI per capita threshold. The Human Assets Index tracks six indicators: the under-five mortality rate; prevalence of stunting; maternal mortality ratio; gross secondary school enrolment ratio; adult literacy rate; and gender parity for gross secondary school enrolment. Bhutan graduated on 13 December 2023.

UNCTAD's multidimensional approach to landlocked states includes developing adequate national transport networks and efficient transit systems, promoting regional or subregional economic integration, and encouraging FDI in economic activities that are not distance-sensitive. The Second UN Conference on LLDCs, held in November 2014, adopted the Vienna Programme of Action for LLDCs for the Decade 2014-24, focusing on transit policy issues; infrastructure development and maintenance; structural economic transformation; regional integration and co-operation; international trade and trade facilitation; and means of implementation.

                    <p>
          The UN recognizes the particular problems of SIDS, which are deemed to be at greater risk of marginalization from the global economy than many other developing countries, owing to adverse consequences arising from their small size; remoteness from large markets (resulting in high transport costs); high economic vulnerability to economic and natural shocks beyond domestic control; fragile ecosystems and high exposure to globally induced phenomena such as rises in sea levels; and (natural shock-related) frequently unstable agricultural production. UNCTAD supports SIDS in building resistance to external shocks through the implementation of climate adaptation and economic diversification measures. UNCTAD aims to identify specific resilience-building and other special support measures for SIDS; to raise the profile of small island vulnerability; to provide relevant advisory services, with a special focus on the least developed SIDS; and to advocate financial support for SIDS’ resilience-building activities. It supports the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (`SAMOA’) Pathway plan on building resilience, augmenting partnerships and renewing commitment to the sustainable development of SIDS during the period 2014-24 (adopted by the Third International Conference on SIDS, convened in September 2014, in Apia, Samoa). A High-Level Mid-Term Review of the SAMOA Pathway, held in September 2019, at a special session of the UN General Assembly, in New York, issued a Political Declaration which called on UNCTAD to continue to assist SIDS to enhance capacity for trade expansion and competitiveness. UNCTAD, with UNEP and other partners, organizes a regular Oceans Forum on trade-related aspects of SDG 14 (`Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources’). The fourth Oceans Forum was held in April 2022 on the theme `A shift to a sustainable ocean economy: Facilitating post-COVID-19 recovery and resilience’. The 4th
          
           International Conference on SIDS was to be convened in May 2024, in Antigua and Barbuda.

          UNCTAD monitors and investigates the social and economic impact of policies of the Israeli authorities in Palestine, and extends technical co-operation. UNCTAD assessed in November 2021 that without the restrictions and military operations imposed by Israel from 2000, the West Bank’s GDP per capita in 2019 would have been 44% higher, and its economic growth would have been less volatile. In January 2024, in view of the recent devastating escalation of the Hamas-Israel conflict, UNCTAD issued a
