        UNEP’s Medium-Term Strategy for the period 2022-25, approved by the Assembly in February 2021, aimed to strengthen the Programme’s contribution to addressing global environmental and societal challenges and to achieving the UN’s 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-UNDP.001">2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development</xr>
        , and its related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It identified climate action, natural action, and chemicals and pollution waste as the key thematic sub-programmes. The Strategy also recognized the need for robust economic governance and innovative science policy, and incorporated these as foundational sub-programmes. In order to deliver on the actions required, the Strategy identified two enabling sub-programmes: finance and economic transformation, and digital transformation. The following were identified as key targets: supporting countries to pursue decarbonization processes, to implement dematerialization practices (limiting the environmental impact of products or services), and to strengthen resilience to climate change; ensuring that states and other stakeholders have increased capacity, finance and access to sustainable technologies to deliver on the adaptation and mitigation commitments of the Paris Agreement; and supporting countries to meet their reporting obligations and to implement required transparency framework arrangements.

               <p>UNEP aims to provide leadership in the sound management of chemicals and waste. It encourages governments and the private sector to develop and adopt policies and practices that are cleaner and safer, make efficient use of natural resources, ensure the sound use and management of chemicals, and reduce pollution in order to address risks to human health and the environment. UNEP also promotes the transfer of appropriate technologies, and organizes conferences and training workshops to support sustainable production and consumption practices.

        UNEP was the principal agency in formulating the 1987 Montreal Protocol to the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer (1985), which provided for a 50% reduction by 2000 in the production of chlorofluoro­carbons (CFCs). An amendment to the Protocol was adopted in 1990, which required complete cessation of the production of CFCs by 2000 in industrialized countries and by 2010 in developing countries. The Copenhagen Amendment, adopted in 1992, stipulated the phasing out of production of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) by 2030 in developed countries and by 2040 in developing nations. Subsequent amendments aimed to introduce a licensing system for all controlled substances, and imposed stricter controls on the import and export of HCFCs, and on the production and consumption of bromochloromethane (Halon-1011, an industrial solvent and fire extinguisher). In September 2007 the states parties to the Vienna Convention agreed to advance the deadline for the elimination of HCFCs to 2020 in developed countries and to 2030 in developing countries. In September 2009 the Vienna Convention and Montreal Protocol became the first agreements on the global environment to attain universal ratification; universal ratification of amendments to the Montreal Protocol was achieved in December 2014. UNEP is the implementing agency of the 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-UN.1394">Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol</xr>
        . The Fund, supported by UNEP’s OzonAction unit within its Law Division, strengthens the capacity of developing states parties, through their National Ozone Units, to comply with the obligations of the Protocol. (By January 2024 147 of the 197 Parties to the Protocol—known as Article 5 countries—were in compliance.) UNEP, UNDP, the World Bank and UNIDO are the sponsors of the Fund. In October 2023 states parties to the Fund agreed on a replenishment of US&#8201;$965m. for the three year period 2024-26.
      </p>
               <p>In October 2016 the states parties, gathered in Kigali, Rwanda, adopted the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, in accordance with which a phased reduction by more than 80% in the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) gases—substances used increasingly in air conditioners and refrigerators—was to be implemented over 30 years. The Kigali Agreement provided for the freezing of HFC consumption levels from 2024 in most developing countries (or, exceptionally, from 2028). It entered into force on 1 January 2019, and by January 2024 had 156 states parties.</p>
               <p>UNEP administers the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal, which entered into force in 1992 with the aim of preventing the uncontrolled movement and disposal of toxic and other hazardous wastes, particularly the illegal dumping of waste in developing countries by companies from industrialized countries. At January 2024 there were 191 parties to the Convention. In August 2016 the inaugural meeting of an Informal Group on Household Waste was held, in Montevideo, Uruguay, under the auspices of the Convention. In February 2004 the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade entered into force, having been formulated and promoted by UNEP, in collaboration with FAO. The Convention (which had 165 parties by January 2024) aims to reduce risks to human health and the environment by restricting the production, export and use of hazardous substances and by enhancing information exchange procedures. UNEP played a leading role in formulating, and provides technical support to, the 2004 Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), addressing particularly hazardous pollutants: pesticides, industrial chemicals and harmful substances that are not produced intentionally. At January 2024 the Stockholm Convention had 186 parties. By that time some 30 POPs were listed under Annex A of the Convention, which requires their elimination; two were listed under Annex B (requiring restrictions on their production and use); and seven unintentionally produced substances were listed under Annex C (they were to be minimized).</p>
               <p>UNEP promotes environmentally sustainable water management, regards the unsustainable use of water as one of the most urgent environmental issues, and places a particular focus on shared transboundary waters. The Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-based Activities (the GPA, adopted in November 1995) focuses on the effects of pollution on freshwater resources, marine biodiversity and the coastal ecosystems of small island developing states (SIDS). A Global Wastewater Initiative (GW2I) was established in 2013 within the framework of the GPA. The third target of SDG 6: Ensure access to water and sanitation for all includes `halving the proportion of untreated wastewater by 2030 and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally’. A Global Partnership on Marine Litter was established in 2012. In early 2017 UNEP launched a UN Clean Seas campaign to address the issue that 80% of all marine litter, some 8m. metric tons collected each year, consists of single-use or non-recoverable plastic; this generally has a slow rate of degradation, and has been identified as entering the human food chain, and killing marine life. By January 2024 63 countries had joined the Clean Seas campaign.</p>
               <p>A joint meeting of the COPs of the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm (BRS) Conventions that was held in late April-early May 2019 agreed to put in place a legally binding global framework on monitoring, tracking and managing plastic waste, with a view to restricting dumping in developing nations and to prompting countries to manage their own plastic waste at the point of generation. In mid-May, accordingly, the parties to the Basel Convention determined to categorize plastic waste of a mixed, contaminated, non-hazardous, non-recyclable, or difficult-to-recycle nature under that Convention’s Annex II, i.e. as waste that requires special consideration and transboundary movement restrictions. The parties to the Basel Convention also established a Plastic Waste Partnership, tasked with collecting information and undertaking analysis of the environmental, economic and social impacts of plastics-related policies.</p>
               <p>
        In March 2022 the second session of the fifth UNEA (UNEA-5.2) resolved to establish an intergovernmental negotiating committee to draft a legally-binding multilateral instrument to address plastic pollution, including its production, design and disposal. The inaugural session of the committee (`INC-1’) was held in November-December, in Punta del Este, Uruguay; INC-3 was convened in November 2023, at UNEP headquarters. UNEP’s One Plastics Initiative aims to promote policies and strategic goals, in partnership with key public and private sector stakeholders, to eliminate global plastic waste and pollution. Since 2018 UNEP has co-led, with the UK-based Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment initiative to engage governments and businesses with the development of a circular economy of plastics. In May 2023 UNEP issued a report titled 
        <publ-name>Turning off the Tap: How the world can end plastic pollution and create a circular economy</publ-name>
        , which proposed systems changes that included curbing unnecessary usage of plastics, transforming business models to render plastics recycling and reuse more profitable, and developing regulatory frameworks to support the adoption of sustainable alternatives.

               <p>In October 2013 an intergovernmental meeting in Minamata, Japan, adopted the Minamata Convention on Mercury, which provides for controls relating to the usage, release, mining, import and export, and safe storage of mercury (which acts in humans as a neurotoxin), and for the phasing-out of the production of several mercury-containing products. The Convention, the secretariat for which is hosted by UNEP, entered into force on 16 August 2017, and by January 2024 had been ratified by 146 states and the EU. The fifth Minamata COP, convened in October-November 2023, in Geneva, Switzerland, agreed several new phase-out deadlines, including 2025 for certain batteries and switches, as well as for use in many cosmetics (except where mercury is used as a preservative), 2026 for most compact fluorescent lamps and certain linear fluorescent lamps (LFLs—fluorescent tube lighting commonly used in shops and offices), and 2027 for triband phosphor LFLs. The use of mercury catalysts in the production of polyurethane was to be banned from 2025. The meeting adopted new mercury waste thresholds to enhance the safety of international shipments, and resolved to broaden the participation of Indigenous people and local communities in policies implemented within the framework of the Convention (in particular in activities concerning artisanal and small-scale gold mining). All states parties were requested to report on national plans to phase-out mercury in dental amalgam and the issue was to be addressed by COP 6, to be held in November 2025.</p>

The use of digital technologies was integral to its new World Environment Situation Room (q.v.). UNEP planned to extend technical expertise to help develop an inclusive digital ecosystem, integrating datasets and analysis of the key environmental challenges, and making these as widely available as possible. Meanwhile, efforts were to be strengthened to close the digital divide, through educational and community initiatives. UNEP was committed to highlighting the potential adverse environmental impact of digital technology, including e-waste and harmful supply chains, and incorporating mitigating measures into its activities.</p>

          comprises some 3,000 scientists as well as other experts and representatives of all UN mem. govts. Approximately every 5 years the IPCC assesses all available scientific, technical and socioeconomic information on anthropogenic climate change. The IPCC provides, on request, ­scientific, technical and socioeconomic advice to the COP to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and to its subsidiary bodies, and compiles reports on specialized topics, such as 
          <publ-name>Aviation and the Global Atmosphere</publ-name>
          , 
          <publ-name>Regional Impacts of Climate Change</publ-name>
          , and 
          <publ-name>Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation</publ-name>
          . The IPCC informs and guides, but does not prescribe, policy. On 1 Nov. 2014 the IPCC released a 
          <publ-name>Synthesis Report</publ-name>
          , concluding its Fifth Assessment (`AR5’) process; it emphasized that the immediate introduction of new policies and forms of international co-operation was required to achieve necessary reductions in greenhouse gas—GHG—emissions (of some 40%-70% globally by 2050) at a manageable cost. The Sixth Assessment process (AR6) was initiated in Oct. 2015. The 47th session of the IPCC, convened in March 2018, established new task groups on gender, and on the implications for the Panel’s future work of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. In April 2016 the IPCC agreed—at the request of the UNFCCC—to produce a special report on the impact of global warming at 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, and on related GHG emission pathways: this was issued in Oct. 2018, and concluded that global warming of even 0.5°C in excess of 1.5°C would expose a significantly higher proportion of the global population to water stress and food scarcity, would increase the incidence and severity of extremely hot weather, would exacerbate sea level rises and almost eradicate ocean corals, and would render insects more than two times as likely to lose one-half of their habitat (with an onwards impact on crop pollination)

          <publ-name>AR6 Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis</publ-name>
          , released in Aug. 2021, emphasized that it was unequivocal that the warming consequences of human influence had caused rapid and unprecedented changes to the Earth’s atmosphere, oceans, cryosphere and biosphere, and noted that evidence of changes in extremes—e.g. in relation to heavy precipitation, tropical cyclones, heatwaves and droughts—had strengthened since AR5; and now envisaged global warming in excess of 2°C during the 21st century, unless `deep reductions’ in CO2 were implemented (it was noted that many changes attributed to GHG emissions, particularly concerning the ocean, global sea level and ice sheets, were irreversible over a very long term); 
          <publ-name>AR6 Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability</publ-name>
          , released in Feb. 2022, placed an increased focus on the integration of natural, social and economic sciences—acknowledging the interdependence of humans, biodiversity and climate, and the interaction between climate change and global trends such as mounting (particularly poorly planned) urbanization, the unsustainable use of natural resources, and damage caused by extreme events; it emphasized the need to restore degraded ecosystems and to conserve up to one-half of the Earth’s land, freshwater and ocean habitats, and called for urgent, ambitious, accelerated action on climate change adaptation, combined with simultaneous rapid, deep reductions in GHG emissions; finally, 
          <publ-name>AR6 Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change, </publ-name>
           which was issued in April, emphasized that developing appropriate policy measures, technologies and infrastructures to bring about major energy sector and lifestyle transitions could lead by 2050 to a 40%-70% reduction in GHG emissions: fossil fuel use would need to be replaced by alternatives such as hydrogen and by widespread electrification, while more effective energy efficiency would be required, involving, 
          <i> inter alia,</i>
           lower consumption, a more efficient use of materials, advancing carbon capture and storage policies on land use, and measures such as promoting `walkable’ cities and zero carbon buildings; the report emphasized the need to address continuing investment gaps. The 
          <publ-name>AR6 Synthesis Report</publ-name>
          , published on 20 March 2023, integrated the findings of its working groups and the special reports commissioned since the process began in 2016; it modelled a range of scenarios given the observed warmings, changes and impacts of future and implemented policies, but reaffirmed that widespread adverse effects of climate change caused by human activity were likely to continue to intensify

      Three conventions arose from the UN Conference on Environment and Development, that was convened in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in June 1992: the Convention on Biological Diversity, the 
      <xr pageref="N" ref="UNCLIMATE.IO">UN Framework Convention on Climate Change</xr>
      , and the UN Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa (which entered into force in December 1996). They aim to combat the triple planetary crisis that has arisen from escalating biodiversity loss, land degradation, and climate change. In 2001 a Joint Liaison Group (JLG) was established to enhance co-ordination between the secretariats of the three accords.

          the CBD entered into force at the end of 1993, and is focused on the preservation of the Earth’s immense variety of plant and animal species, in particular those threatened with extinction; a Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety regulates the transboundary movement and use of living modified organisms (LMOs) resulting from biotechnology: it entered into force in Sept. 2003, and had been ratified by 173 states parties by Jan. 2024. An Advanced Informed Agreement procedure to govern the import of LMOs and a Biosafety Clearing-House mechanism to facilitate information sharing on LMOs have been established under the Cartagena Protocol. In Oct. 2010 the 10th Conf. of the Parties (COP) to the CBD, meeting in Nagoya, Japan, approved the Nagoya Protocol to the CBD, focused on establishing an international regime on access to and benefit sharing of genetic resources; this entered into force in Oct. 2014 and had 141 ratifications at Jan. 2024. The meeting also adopted a supplementary agreement to the Cartagena Protocol (the so-called Nagoya-Kuala Lumpur Supplementary Protocol) concerned with liability and redress; it entered into force in March 2018, and had received 54 notifications by Jan. 2024. The 12th COP to the CBD, convened in Oct. 2012, in Hyderabad, India, determined formally to classify marine areas of ecological or biological significance. In July 2018 an MOU was concluded between the CBD and FAO’s International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. The 5th edition of the CBD’s 
          <publ-name>Global Biodiversity Outlook,</publ-name>
           (GBO-5, issued in Sept. 2020) recommended 8 transformative actions for reversing the degradation of the natural world: conserving land and forest ecosystems; designing sustainable agriculture systems; enabling sustainable (and more plant-based) food systems; ensuring sustainable fisheries and oceans; creating green cities and infrastructure; ensuring sustainable freshwater systems; undertaking sustainable climate action; and implementing an integrated `One Health’ approach to promote healthy ecosystems and healthy people. The first phase of the 15th CBD COP, hosted in Oct. 2021 from Kunming, People’s Rep. of China, adopted the Kunming Declaration (themed `Ecological Civilization: Building a Shared Future for All Life on Earth’), in which more than 100 states committed to mainstreaming biodiversity in decision making and to adopting an effective post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF); the meeting also established a US&#8201;$223.4m. Kunming Biodiversity Fund, which was to support biodiversity conservation in developing states; the second phase of the COP, was hosted by China from Montréal, Canada in Dec. 2022; the meeting endorsed the Kunming-Montreal GBF, which incorporated 23 new environmental targets to counter the loss of biodiversity including the so-called 30x30 aim (Target 3) to protect 30% of land, inland waters and oceans by 2030 and to restore 30% of degraded terrestrial and marine environments; other targets included reducing by one-half the risk from pesticides, nutrients lost to the environment and the rate of introduction of invasive alien species; govts agreed that by 2030 biodiversity-related funding should reach $200,000m. and subsidies that harm biodiversity should be phased out

          UNCCD entered into force in Dec. 1996. In Oct. 1998 a Global Mechanism was established under UNCCD, to provide strategic advisory services to developing countries on means of attracting and increasing investments in sustainable land management, for example through microfinance and climate change funds. COP11, held in Windhoek, Namibia, in Sept.-Oct. 2013 agreed to establish a Science Policy Interface to facilitate the communication of scientific findings to policymakers. A Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) Fund was established during COP13, held in Ordos, People’s Republic of China, in Sept. 2017; 12-year strategy aimed at halting the spread of land degradation, and an inaugural gender action plan were adopted by COP13. At that time UNCCD issued the first edition of the

          , which stated that consumption of the Earth's natural reserves had doubled over the previous 30 years and that some 15,000,000m. trees were being felled annually. COP14, held in Sept. 2019, in New Delhi, India, introduced a UNCCD Drought Toolbox (aimed at strengthening states’ preparedness and resilience), and established an international coalition to co-ordinate action on sand and dust storms

The report stressed that present mismanagement of land resources (i.e. of biodiversity, soil and water) threatened the health (incl. through a higher risk of transmission of zoonotic diseases) and the onwards survival of many species, including humankind, and that maintaining the present trajectory would prompt further land degradation and increased disruptions to food supplies, forced migration and land resource conflicts; modern agriculture was cited as the cause of 80% of deforestation and of most biodiversity loss, and was reported to account for 70% of freshwater use—requiring a revision of global food systems; the report emphasized that the traditional and local knowledge of Indigenous peoples and local communities could be used to protect and regenerate natural capital

Memorandums of Understanding concluded under the CMS include conservation measures for the West African Elephant (2005), the Saiga Antelope (2006), Atlantic Populations of the Mediterranean Monk Seal (2007), Dugongs (2007), Migratory Birds of Prey in Africa and Eurasia (2008), High Andean Flamingos and their Habitats (2008) and Migratory Sharks (2010). Other multilateral agreements negotiated under CMS auspices include: the Agreement on the Conservation of Populations of European Bats (adopted in 1991 and entered into force in 1994); the Agreement on Cetaceans of the Black Seas, Mediterranean, and Contiguous Atlantic Area (ACCOBAMS—adopted in 1996, entered into force in 2001); the African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbird Agreement (AEWA—entered into force in Nov. 1999) which focuses on the conservation of waterbirds that migrate along the so-called `African Eurasian Flyway’; the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP—signed in 2001, entered into force in 2004); and the Agreement on the Conservation of Gorillas and Their Habitats (concluded in 2007, covering 10 range states, and entered into force in 2008). A Multi-Stakeholder Energy Task Force, established in 2016, is tasked with reconciling renewable energy developments with the conservation of migratory species. In Feb. 2020 the 13th CMS COP, held in Gandhinagar, India, advocated for the concept of `ecological connectivity’ to be prioritized in the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework</content-note>
