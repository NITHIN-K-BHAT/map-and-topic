      UNESCO’s medium-term strategy for the period 2022-29 identified five core functions for the organization: a laboratory of ideas; a clearing house: i.e. developing and reinforcing the global agenda in its fields of competence; a standard-setter; a catalyst and motor for international and regional co-operation; and a capacity-builder: providing advice for policy development and implementation. Africa and gender equality were identified as global priorities, and youth and small island developing states as priority groups. UNESCO’s strategic objectives during 2022-29 were: to ensure quality equitable and inclusive education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all, in order, 
      <i>inter alia,</i>
       to reduce inequalities and promote learning and creative societies, particularly in the digital era; to work towards sustainable societies and protecting the environment through the promotion of science, technology, innovation and natural heritage; to build inclusive, just and peaceful societies by promoting freedom of expression, cultural diversity, education for global citizenship, and protecting heritage; and to foster a technological environment in the service of humankind through the development and dissemination of knowledge and skills and the formulation of ethical standards.
    </p>
          <p>Scientific and environmental education; media and information literacy and digital competencies; artificial intelligence (AI), digital ethics and innovation; learning for diversity; and Indigenous knowledge, cultures and languages were identified as cross-cutting dimensions of the 2022-29 strategy. Crisis preparedness and response was also a principal focus.</p>
          <p usage="edio ass">Under the focal area `Priority Africa’ UNESCO’s activities are aimed at addressing emerging continental challenges such as the transition to a knowledge economy; building inclusive, peaceful and resilient societies; and establishing conditions for the preservation and promotion of durable collective peace and security.</p>

               <heading>Education</heading>
               <p>In May 2015 a World Education Forum—co-led by UNESCO and held in Incheon, Republic of Korea (South Korea)—adopted the Incheon Declaration, which secured support of the international community for education targets included in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that were subsequently endorsed in September. Implementation of the Incheon Declaration and SDG 4: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all, was to be achieved through an `Education 2030 Framework for Action’. Targets attached to SDG 4 included ensuring by 2030 provision to all free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education; access to quality early childhood development, care and pre-primary education; equal access for all women and men to affordable and quality technical, vocational and tertiary education; increasing training in technical and vocational skills; eliminating gender disparities in education; and ensuring that all young people and a substantial proportion of adults achieve literacy and numeracy. In May 2018 an International Finance Facility for Education was inaugurated, to support the implementation of SDG 4.</p>
               <p>Inclusive education is identified by UNESCO as an essential human right and public good, and by its 2022-29 medium-term strategy as the `most powerful catalytic force’ to advance the UN’s 2030 Agenda. The strategy document emphasized, however, that the COVID-19 pandemic had caused an unprecedented disruption to educational provision, exacerbating pre-existing inequalities, exclusion and marginalization, with the potential to create a `generational catastrophe’. It was noted that in 2022, globally, 258m. children were not enrolled at schools—with more than three-fifths of girls in sub-Saharan Africa not completing lower secondary education; one-half of students worldwide were not acquiring basic literacy or numeracy skills; and 69m. more teachers were required. UNESCO aimed to support national education authorities in drafting and implementing evidence-based education policies that would mainstream the pursuit of SDG 4, and would enshrine the right to continuity of education, including for children in crisis situations. Priority areas identified by the strategy included—with a view to fostering employability and empowerment, particularly in fields connected with digital transformation and ecological transition—the dissemination of best practices for teaching and learning; diversification of learning pathways; strengthening skills development, with a particular focus on advancing digital and new knowledge competencies, and on literacy; technical and vocational education and training; science, technology, engineering and mathematics education; higher education; and creative and cultural industries. UNESCO aimed to advance the development of quality learning materials; to support teachers in using remote and hybrid professional techniques; and to promote policies and strategies aimed at developing the use of AI in education. UNESCO aims to develop education systems that foster quality lifelong learning opportunities.</p>

               <p>
        A global framework on Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) for the period 2020-30 was adopted by UNESCO’s General Conference in November 2019. A UNESCO Futures of Education initiative was initiated in September of that year, as a framework to promote global discussion on the role of education and learning. An International Commission on the Futures of Education was established to elaborate a related report: 
        <publ-name>Reimagining our futures together: a new social contract for education</publ-name>
        , which was published in November 2021. In October 2020 an extraordinary high-level General Education Meeting (GEM), was organized by UNESCO, with participation by heads of state and or government, ministers responsible for education, and other stakeholders, to consider means of protecting education in the context of the COVID-19 crisis, including safeguarding the fiscal space for education provision and promoting education as a driving force for inclusive recovery and for sustainable development. In July 2021 more than 85 ministers responsible for education and other stakeholders endorsed a Global Education Cooperation Mechanism, which was to support member states’ pursuit of SDG 4 and recovery from the disruption to education caused by the COVID-19 crisis. Support for the Mechanism was incorporated into the Paris Declaration issued at the end of the 2021 GEM, held in November. The meeting also endorsed a new SDG 4-Education 2030 High Level Steering Committee. In September 2022 the UN Secretary-General convened a Transforming Education Summit, in New York, USA, at which several global initiatives were launched. A new International Financing Facility for Education (IFFEd) was, from 2023, to disburse (initially) US&#8201;$2,000m. in additional funding for education programmes. A UNESCO-UNICEF Gateways to Public Digital Learning project, announced at the summit, aimed to advance inclusive digital learning platforms and content. Participating states also initiated a Greening Education Partnership, and pledged a Commitment to Action on Education in Crisis Situations. In June 2023 the UN Secretary-General established a UNESCO- and International Labour Organization-supported High-level Panel on the Teaching Profession, tasked with making recommendations based on the outcomes of the 2022 Transforming Education Summit.

        A 
        <publ-name>Global Education Monitoring (GEM) Report</publ-name>
         is published annually. The 2023 edition, issued in July, was subtitled 
        <publ-name>Technology in education: A tool on whose terms?</publ-name>
        , and focused on the appropriate and controlled use of technology in educational environments. The report noted the `immeasurable potential’ of the ongoing digital revolution, but emphasized a lack of relevant governance and regulation. The value of engagement between qualified teachers and pupils was emphasized—and the need for this to be supported by, but not supplanted by technology, and for children to learn to filter value from the abundance of available online information, while ignoring unnecessary detail. The report recommended banning smartphone use in schools, claiming that smartphones represented a distraction to learning, and had the potential to undermine pupils’ right to privacy, and to fuel cyberbullying.

               <p usage="ewyb edio">The UNESCO Associated Schools Project (ASPnet—comprising more than 12,000 institutions in 182 countries in 2024) has, since 1953, provides a forum for dialogue and for promoting best practices in support of peace, human rights, democracy and international co-operation through education. At tertiary level UNESCO chairs a University Twinning and Networking (UNITWIN) initiative, which was established in 1992 to establish links between higher education and research institutions. UNESCO acts as Secretariat to the Global Convention on the Recognition of Qualifications concerning Higher Education, and to five related regional recognition conventions. In March 2023 a legally binding Global Convention on the Recognition of Higher Education Qualifications—the first ever treaty on higher education—entered into force (having been adopted in November 2019 by the UNESCO General Conference). It established principles for the international recognition of qualifications and processes for collaboration between recognition bodies and higher education institutions worldwide, and was expected to enhance international academic mobility. UNESCO’s International Centre for Technical and Vocational Education and Training (UNESCO-UNEVOC, located in Bonn, Germany) and global network of more than 220 local UNEVOC centres support the advancement of technical and vocational education and training (known as TVET) in member states. A UNESCO strategy on TVET for the period 2022-29 was approved by the Executive Board in April 2022.</p>

               <p id="IO-UN.2334" usage="ewyb edio mena ass">Within the UN system UNESCO is responsible for providing technical assistance and educational services in the context of emergency situations. This includes establishing temporary schools, providing education for refugees and displaced persons, as well as assistance for the rehabilitation of national education systems. A UNESCO Heritage Emergency Fund, initiated in 2015, supported 27 initiatives in 18 countries during 2022. At the inaugural World Humanitarian Summit, held in İstanbul, Turkey (now known as Türkiye), in June 2016, a fund—`Education Cannot Wait’—was launched, with the aim of increasing access to learning opportunities for children living through emergencies.</p>
               <p>In March 2020 UNESCO established a COVID-19 Emergency Task Force, and also initiated a Global Education Coalition—comprising a membership of (as at January 2024) 32 international and regional organizations, and 134 private sector and civil society bodies—that was tasked with supporting inclusive learning solutions for students confined to their homes. In April 2020 UNESCO reported that one-half of all learners who were confined to their homes (rising to 82% in Africa) had no online access. UNESCO-UNEVOC and the Coalition have established an online Global Skills Academy, which aims to reach 10m. online learners by 2029; a Global Teacher Campus; and a Global Learning House, providing learners with cost-free supplemental instruction. In late 2022 the Coalition established a Digital Transformation Collaborative, focused on mobilizing resources to close educational divides.</p>

               <heading>Culture</heading>
               <p>In undertaking efforts to preserve the world's cultural and natural heritage UNESCO has attempted to emphasize the link between culture and development. In December 1992 UNESCO established the World Commission on Culture and Development; the first World Conference on Culture and Development was held in June 1999, in Havana, Cuba. In November 2001 the General Conference adopted the UNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity, which affirmed the importance of intercultural dialogue in establishing a climate of peace. In September 2022, at the MONDIACULT 2022 conference, convened by UNESCO in Mexico City, Mexico, member states adopted a landmark Declaration for Culture, which affirmed the status of culture as a `global public good’.</p>
               <p usage="edio">UNESCO addresses challenges in achieving gender equality in cultural life, including difficulties faced by women in attaining senior management positions and decision-making roles; unequal value attributed to the roles of women and men in heritage protection and transmission; unequal opportunities for women to share their creativity with audiences; limitations on freedom of expression based on gender; and unequal access to technical and entrepreneurial training, as well as to financial resources, based on gender.</p>
               <p>UNESCO's culture programme also aims to safeguard movable cultural heritage, and to support and develop museums as a means of preserving heritage and making it broadly accessible to society. In November 2015 the General Conference adopted a Recommendation on the Protection and Promotion of Museums and Collections, their Diversity and their Role in Society.</p>
               <p usage="ewyb edio">In January 2002 UNESCO inaugurated the Global Alliance on Cultural Diversity, to promote partnerships between governments, non-governmental bodies and the private sector with a view to supporting cultural diversity through the strengthening of cultural industries and the prevention of cultural piracy. An International Convention on the Protection of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions, approved by the General Conference in 2005, entered into force in March 2007. UNESCO maintains an International Fund for Cultural Diversity.</p>
               <p>UNESCO's World Heritage Programme, inaugurated in 1978, aims to protect historic sites and natural landmarks of outstanding universal significance, in accordance with the 1972 UNESCO Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, by providing financial aid for restoration, technical assistance, training and management planning. UNESCO recognizes that new global threats may affect natural and cultural heritage, and emphasizes that conservation of sites contributes to social cohesion. A World Heritage Committee—comprising 21 elected states parties to the Convention—considers sites nominated to be included on the so-called World Heritage List. In November 2014 the first extraordinary session of the Convention’s General Assembly agreed to introduce more equitable geographical and cultural representation on the World Heritage Committee. The 45th regular meeting of the World Heritage Committee was convened in September 2023, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. As at 1 January 2024 the World Heritage List comprised 1,199 sites globally, of which 933 had cultural significance, 227 were natural landmarks, and 48 were of `mixed' importance. The List included 48 transboundary sites. UNESCO also maintains a `List of World Heritage in Danger', with 56 entries at 1 January 2024, in order to attract international attention to sites particularly at risk from the environment or human activities.</p>

In 2024 the list of World Heritage in Danger included four national parks and reserves in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC); the Niokolo-Koba National Park in Senegal; the Selous Game Reserve in Tanzania; the tombs of Buganda Kings at Kasubi, Uganda; the Rainforests of the Atsinanana in Madagascar; and (owing to conflict in northern Mali) the old town of Djenné and four neighbouring archaeological sites, and the city of Tombouctou and the Tomb of Askia (dating from 1495, and situated in Gao). In July 2017 the World Heritage Committee removed the Simien National Park (Ethiopia) from the list of sites in danger; similarly, the DRC’s Salonga National Park was removed in July 2021. Lake Turkana National Parks, in Kenya, were added to that list in 2018, in view of concerns over the impact of the Gilgel Gibe III Dam (on the Omo River, in Ethiopia) on Lake Turkana’s flow and ecosystem, and also over threats to the lake posed by Ethiopia’s Kuraz Sugar Development Project.</p>

                    <p usage="mena">A UNESCO observatory was established in Beirut, Lebanon, in July 2014 to monitor and assess the state of Syria’s cultural heritage. In August 2015 the UNESCO Director-General declared as a war crime the destruction of Baalshamin temple at Palmyra, Syria (a World Heritage site) by Islamic State militants. In April 2016 a team of experts completed a rapid assessment of the state of the museum and archeological site at Palmyra, some of which remained inaccessible. The mission identified a series of emergency measures aimed at securing the museum from the Islamic State ­insurgency. In January 2017 the UNESCO Director-General condemned the destruction of further parts of the Palmyra site as a war crime. In that month a UNESCO emergency mission was dispatched to Aleppo to undertake a preliminary assessment of conflict-related damage to cultural sites and education institutions there. This found that some 60% of the old city of Aleppo had been severely damaged and that around 30% had been destroyed. In March 2015 the UNESCO Director-General urged all actors engaged in military operations in Yemen to protect that country’s cultural heritage; in June she condemned air strikes on the Old City of Sana’a (designated as a World Heritage site). In late July 2014 the UNESCO Director-General condemned the recent destruction by Islamic State militants of the tomb and mosque of Prophet Jonas in Mosul, Iraq, and demanded that the ongoing intentional destruction of Iraqi religious and cultural heritage should cease. In that month UNESCO approved an Emergency Response Action Plan aimed at safeguarding Iraq’s cultural heritage. In August the Director-General demanded the immediate cessation of `emerging cultural cleansing’ in northern Iraq, manifested in attacks against members of religious and ethnic minorities. In February 2015, following attacks by terrorists against Mosul Museum and various archaeological sites in the Nineveh region, as well as book burnings in Mosul, the Director-General proposed that an emergency session of the UN Security Council should be held to address the protection of Iraq’s cultural heritage, and requested the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court to open an investigation into the ongoing destruction (designated under the Court’s Rome Statute as a war crime). In late May UNESCO welcomed the adoption of a UN General Resolution on `Saving the Cultural Heritage of Iraq’. In February 2018—in view of the Iraqi Government’s announcement in December 2017 that Islamic State had been defeated in Iraq—an International Conference on the Reconstruction of Iraq was convened, in Kuwait City. At that time the UNESCO Director-General initiated the flagship programme `Revive the Spirit of Mosul’, with a particular focus on the human dimension of reconstruction. Under the programme UNESCO was co-ordinating the restoration and rehabilitation of cultural heritage, and of educational and cultural institutions. In January 2023 an extraordinary session of the World Heritage Committee inscribed the Landmarks of the Ancient Kingdom of Saba, Ma’rib (Yemen) and the Rachid Karami International Fair-Tripoli (Lebanon) as World Heritage sites; both were added to the List of World Heritage in Danger.</p>

               <p usage="sasia">In early 2001 UNESCO condemned an alleged edict by the fundamentalist Islamist Taliban regime in Afghanistan—which held power there during 1996-2001, and regained control in August 2021—that ordered the destruction of all statues in that country that, owing to their representation of human likenesses, were regarded as non-Islamic. In March UNESCO protested strongly against the reported destruction by order of the Taliban of two ancient monuments of Buddha at Bamiyan. In January 2002, following the overthrow of the Taliban in late 2001, the newly-appointed Afghan Interim Administration requested UNESCO to co-ordinate all international and bilateral activities to protect Afghanistan's cultural heritage; UNESCO subsequently initiated a campaign to assess the situation. In March 2002 a Memorandum of Understanding was concluded between UNESCO and the Interim Administration providing for UNESCO to manage international efforts towards rehabilitating the national museum in Kabul, where a number of artefacts had been destroyed under (the first phase of) Taliban rule. In October UNESCO's Executive Board approved the establishment of an International Co-ordination Committee for the Safeguarding of Afghanistan's Cultural Heritage, to be administered by UNESCO with participation by other agencies and organizations, donor nations and experts. The 12th century minaret and archaeological remains of Jam, and the cultural landscape and archaeological remains of the Bamiyan Valley, were added to the World Heritage in Danger list in 2002 and 2003, respectively. During 2001-21 some €23m. were reportedly invested by the international community in conserving Afghanistan’s historic and cultural heritage. In August 2021, when the Taliban overthrew that country’s governing administration, UNESCO called for the preservation of Afghanistan’s diverse (including pre-Islamic) cultural heritage, in full respect for international law.</p>

A global Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, inaugurated in November 2008, and companion Register of Good Safeguarding Practices and List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding collectively comprised, at March 2024, 730 elements from 145 countries.</p>

        UNESCO promotes and supports international scientific partnerships to monitor, assess and report on the state of Earth systems. With the World Meteorological Organization and the International Science Council, UNESCO sponsors the World Climate Research Programme, which was established in 1980 to determine the predictability of climate and the effect of human activity on climate. UNESCO hosts the Secretariat of the World Water Assessment Programme, which prepares the periodic

UNESCO is part of a Transboundary Water Cooperation Coalition that was launched in December 2022—during the first UN-Water Summit on Groundwater, hosted by UNESCO at its headquarters—with the aim of strengthening transboundary water governance at the regional and global levels. UNESCO participates in a long-term project to develop a Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS), linking existing and planned observation systems to enable greater understanding of the earth's processes, and improved dissemination of detailed data—for example, predicting health epidemics or weather phenomena, or concerning the management of ecosystems and natural resources. The International Geoscience Programme, undertaken jointly with the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS), facilitates the exchange of knowledge and methodology among scientists concerned with geological processes and aims to raise awareness of the links between geoscience and sustainable socioeconomic development; UNESCO is the only UN agency mandated to provide the IUGS with research and capacity building support. The 50th anniversary of the International Geoscience Programme was marked in March 2023 with a conference held at UNESCO headquarters, on the theme `Healing the Earth’.
