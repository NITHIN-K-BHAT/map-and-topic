In 1987 the organization's name was changed to the UN Population Fund (retaining the same acronym). UNFPA works to promote reproductive rights, and universal access to sexual and reproductive health care, with a particular focus on women and youth.</p>

          <heading>Activities</heading>
          <p>UNFPA's activities are broadly defined by the Programme of Action adopted by the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), which was held in Cairo, Egypt, in September 1994. UNFPA serves as the lead agency in following up the objectives of the Programme of Action, which envisaged universal access to reproductive health care services and family planning services, a reduction in infant, child and maternal mortality, a reduction in the rate of HIV infection, improving life expectancy at birth, and universal access to primary education for all children. The Programme of Action also emphasized the necessity of empowering and educating women, as a basis for successful sustainable human development. </p>
          <p>
      Of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) incorporated into the UN’s 
      <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-UNDP.001">2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development</xr>
      , UNFPA has a particular focus on SDG 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages; SDG 4: Ensure inclusive and quality education for all and promote lifelong learning; and SDG 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. In 2018 UNFPA identified the following three transformative results (the `three zeros’) to be achieved by 2030: Zero unmet need for family planning; Zero preventable maternal deaths; and Zero gender-based violence and harmful practices.
    </p>
          <p>
      A high-level `Nairobi Summit on ICPD25: Accelerating the promise’, convened by UNFPA and by the governments of Kenya and Denmark, in the Kenyan capital, in November 2019, issued the Nairobi Statement, which outlined a collective agenda aimed at completing implementation of the ICPD’s Programme of Action, in alignment with the 
      <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-UNDP.001">2030 Agenda</xr>
      , and included the following commitments: Achieve universal access to sexual and reproductive health care as part of Universal Health Coverage; Uphold the right to sexual and reproductive health care in fragile and humanitarian contexts; Mobilize the financing required to complete and sustain the gains made under the ICPD Programme of Action; Draw on demographic diversity to drive economic growth and sustainable development; and Address gender-based violence (GBV) and child, early and forced marriages, and female genital mutilation and cutting (FGM/C). In September 2020 a High-Level Commission (HLC) was established to monitor and report on progress in achieving the Nairobi commitments. The HLC issued a report in November 2022 which urged the dismantling of discriminatory and unequal structures that impede development. Its final report, published in September 2023, incorporated a new global monitoring framework to monitor progress in achieving the Nairobi commitments and outlined transformative actions to accelerate change.
    </p>
          <p>UNFPA's strategic plan for the period 2022-25 recognized the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on progress towards achieving its declared goals, and prioritized the following strategic outcomes: an acceleration in the reduction of the unmet need for family planning, of preventable maternal deaths, and of GBV or harmful practices against women and girls, including child marriage and FGM/C. The plan outlined measures to strengthen the effectiveness of UNFPA in realizing its goals, including promoting the participation of women and youth, enhancing information services, incorporating climate change and the shifting global demographics into programming, and reinvigorating partnerships, including South-South and triangular co-operation. A new Strategic Investment Facility was to be established in order to support the shift from development funding into a financing model with innovative approaches to mobilizing international funds and investment. The plan also determined that a Reproductive Health Bridging Fund was to be established to assist government procurement of reproductive health commodities.</p>

               <heading>Sexual and Reproductive Health</heading>
               <p>UNFPA recognizes that it is the right of every individual to make their own choices about their own sexual and reproductive health, and that access to safe, voluntary family planning is pivotal to gender equality and to the empowerment of women. In November 2022 a new UNFPA Strategy for Family Planning was launched, to cover the period 2022-30, with focus on the following eight strategic priorities: Expand availability and access; Improve quality; Strengthen data; Deepen integration; Increase sustainability; Build resilience and improve adaptation; Engage adolescents and youth; and Enhance agency and address discrimination.</p>
               <p>UNFPA encourages the integration of family planning into all maternal, child and other reproductive health care. Its efforts to improve the quality of these services include support for the training of health care personnel and promoting greater accessibility to education and services. Many reproductive health projects focus on the reduction of maternal mortality—i.e. deaths related to pregnancy and childbirth, of which around 300,000 occur annually. Projects to reduce maternal deaths have focused on improving accessibility to essential obstetric care and ensuring the provision of skilled attendance to women in labour. UNFPA supports the strengthening of national health systems, and helps (particularly developing) countries to widen access to effective contraceptives, as well as to essential medicines for maternal health. The UNFPA Supplies Partnership (launched in 2008, and in its third phase of operations during 2021-30) strengthens contraceptives supply chains and reproductive health services. The Fund supports research into contraceptives, and training in contraceptive technology.</p>
               <p>
        UNFPA supports the provision of Emergency Obstetric And Newborn Care (EmONC), including the training of midwives and midwifery tutors. In September 2020 UNFPA issued an 
        <publ-name>Implementation Manual for Developing a National Network of Maternity Units Improving Emergency Obstetric And Newborn Care,</publ-name>
         which focused on means of achieving SDG targets stipulating that every pregnant woman should have the possibility to deliver her baby in a referral health facility that provides safe `EmONC’. UNFPA maintains a related online Midwifery Dashboard. UNFPA’s 
        <publ-name>State of the World’s Midwifery 2021,</publ-name>
         published in May of that year, reported that there was a global shortage of 900,000 midwives. By the end of 2022 UNFPA’s Maternal and Newborn Health Thematic Fund, initiated in 2008, had supported the provision of pre-service education and in-service training to some 84,000 midwives.
      </p>
               <p>In addition to maternal deaths, an estimated 10m.-15m. women suffer serious illnesses or disabilities as a result of inadequate care in pregnancy and childbirth. UNFPA promotes safer maternal and post-natal health care in developing countries. UNFPA’s Global Campaign to End Fistula aims to improve the prevention and treatment of this obstetric condition in 50 countries, mainly in Africa and Asia, and to achieve its elimination. In December 2014 the UN General Assembly adopted an UNFPA-supported resolution on accelerating efforts to eradicate the condition.</p>

        UNFPA is a co-sponsor of the 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-WHO.2506">Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS</xr>
         (UNAIDS), and is the convening agency with responsibility for young people and for condom programming, as well as taking a leading role in the UNAIDS inter-agency task team on gender and HIV/AIDS. The Fund maintains that meeting the reproductive health needs of adolescents is an urgent priority in combating poverty and HIV/AIDS.

               <p>UNFPA supports the `Every Woman Every Child’ campaign, launched in September 2010, and the Global Strategy for Women’s, Children’s and Adolescents’ Health, covering 2016-30. The Global Strategy laid out a roadmap that comprised targets aligned with the SDGs—to be achieved by 2030—and was aimed at ending all preventable deaths of women, children and adolescents, and at ensuring that they should thrive and should transform the world.</p>

               <heading>Young People</heading>
               <p>UNFPA advocates for full participation in society and leadership by young people, and notes that barriers to this are, overall, higher for girls and young women. The Fund works to protect adolescents from the consequences of unwanted early pregnancies, which can include lack of education opportunities, economic disempowerment, social isolation, health complications and even premature death. It promotes comprehensive sexuality education policies, extending reproductive health care to adolescent girls, and helping girls who become pregnant to return to school and reach their full potential. UNFPA works closely with UNICEF to advocate against child marriage. A joint Global Programme to Accelerate Action to End Child Marriage, being implemented during 2016-30, involved collaborating with governments, civil society organizations and at grassroots level to formulate legislation, to provide life skills and other education and to strengthen protection services for girls at risk of and affected by child marriage. Its third and final phase, during 2024-30, was focused on meeting the challenges posed by the ongoing global `polycrisis’ (the interplay of factors including conflicts, environmental disasters, humanitarian emergencies, climate change and mounting inequalities); a global pushback against gender equality; and the slow pace of decline in child marriage.</p>

               <heading>Human Rights and Gender Equality</heading>
               <p>A fundamental aspect of UNFPA's mission is to achieve gender equality, in order to promote the basic human rights of women and, through the empowerment of women, to support the elimination of poverty. Incorporated into all UNFPA activities are efforts to improve the welfare of women, in particular by providing reproductive choice, to eradicate gender discrimination, and to protect women from sexual and domestic violence and coercion. It also aims to engage men and boys in these efforts, in order to advance its objectives and achieve greater benefits for the wider community. UNFPA has developed and administers a geospatial dashboard on intimate partner violence, providing comparative and disaggregated data from 119 countries. In December 2021 UNFPA launched `Bodyright’, a campaign that aimed to hold policymakers, social media platforms and individuals accountable for publishing material online that perpetuates GBV. An UNFPA Equalizer Accelerator Fund finances initiatives in the areas of sexual and reproductive health, maternal health, and GBV.</p>
               <p>The Fund aims to encourage the participation of women at all levels of decision making and policy formulation and supports programmes that improve the access of all girls and women to education and grant women equal access to land, credit and employment opportunities. UNFPA actively participates in efforts to raise awareness of and implement Resolution 1325 of the UN Security Council, adopted in October 2000, relating to the impact of armed conflict on women and girls, the role of women in peacebuilding, and gender dimensions in peace processes and conflict resolution.</p>
               <p>
        In April 2020 UNFPA issued a report, 
        <publ-name>Measuring SDG Target 5.6</publ-name>
        , which addressed the state of play of women’s reproductive decision making in 57 countries, and sexual and reproductive rights in 107 countries. The report found that one-quarter of women in the countries covered were neither in a position to make their own decisions about accessing adequate health care, nor to refuse sexual relations, and that in more than two-fifths of the countries women’s reproductive rights were regressing.
      </p>
               <p>
        Since 2007 UNFPA and 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-UN.1231">UNICEF</xr>
         have led the global Joint Programme to Eliminate FGM/C, which, with a focus on 17 countries, facilitates FGM-related protection and care services, community education and dialogue, supports legal and policy frameworks that ban the practice, and promotes the enforcement of such bans. UNFPA, UNICEF and the Addis Ababa, Ethiopia-based Inter-African Committee on Traditional Practices co-sponsor the International Day of Zero Tolerance for FGM, observed annually on 6 February. UNFPA maintains an online FGM Dashboard that includes data sourced from household surveys.

               <p>Of major concern to UNFPA is evidence of ongoing gender bias and sex selection at birth. It has worked to highlight the issue and the consequences of longer-term gender imbalance.</p>

               <heading>Population Matters</heading>
               <p>UNFPA helps countries to formulate and implement comprehensive population policies as a part of poverty eradication and sustainable development strategies. It highlights the so-called demographic dividend, incorporating social and economic benefits, of advancing gender equality and the reproductive wellbeing of women and girls. Research, educational and advocacy activities are undertaken to focus on specific aspects of development and population concern, for example migration, the massive wave of urbanization in recent years, and the impact on communities of climate change. UNFPA provides technical assistance and training to national statistical offices to support the undertaking of population censuses and basic data collection, and maintains an online Global Census Tracker. It also supports the analysis of demographic and socioeconomic data, research on population trends and national policy making.</p>
               <p>UNFPA raises awareness on ageing—which it terms `a triumph of development’ (i.e. of improved health care, nutrition, sanitation and economic wellbeing)—and supports data collection and research to form a solid base for ageing-related planning and policies. In mid-2022 the UN forecast that the proportion of the global population aged 65 years or over would expand to 16% by 2050, compared with 10% in 2022.</p>
               <p>In September 2016, at the inaugural UN Summit on Refugees and Migrants, UNFPA advocated for the reproductive rights of people on the move. The Fund supports the training and deployment of midwives and other health professionals, and distributes health supplies in support of refugee and migrant pregnant women and their babies.</p>
               <p>
        In October 2023 UNFPA issued 
        <publ-name>Taking Stock: Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights in Climate Commitments: A Global Review</publ-name>
        , which assessed the national climate plans of 119 countries, and found that—despite the disruptive impacts of climate change-related population displacement and food insecurity—only one-third of such plans included commitments to upholding women and girls’ sexual and reproductive health rights, only 23 referenced maternal and newborn health, and 15 referenced GBV.

               <p>UNFPA maintains an online Population Data Portal, comprising indicators on population, gender equality, sexual and reproductive health, family planning, education, and labour.</p>
               <p>
        In 2022 UNFPA marked 15 November as the day the global population reached 8,000m. 
        <publ-name>World Population Prospects 2022,</publ-name>
         issued in July by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, stated that the pace of population growth was decelerating, and forecast a global population of 9,700m. by the year 2050 and of 10,400m. by 2100. The report noted that, globally, life expectancy in 2019 was 72.8 years, with a female survival advantage observed across all regions and countries. Average fertility globally in 2021 stood at 2.3 births per woman over her lifetime (having fallen from around 5 births per woman in 1950). The populations of many of the world’s 46 least developed countries were projected to double over the period 2022-50, driven by an excess of births over deaths, and placing additional pressure on resources. Meanwhile, it was reported that in high-income countries during 2000-20 net inflows from migration had exceeded the balance of births over deaths. The 2023 edition of UNFPA’s annual 
        <publ-name>State of the World’s Population</publ-name>
        , released in April of that year with the subtitle 
        <publ-name>8 Billion Lives, Infinite Possibilities: the case for rights and choices</publ-name>
        , observed—against a background of anxiety about impacts of human population expansion—the increasing adoption by governments of policies aimed at manipulating fertility rates. This approach was deemed by the report to be `very often ineffective’ and to risk eroding women’s rights. The media and politicians were urged to focus firmly on upholding women’s freedom to make their own reproductive choices. In that month it was reported that India had overtaken China as the world’s most populous country.

               <p>UNFPA takes a lead role in emergency situations, giving special attention to the specific needs of women and youth, for example by providing supplies and services to protect reproductive health, to ensure safe childbirth, and to meet basic family planning and hygiene needs. It conducts rapid health assessments, supports counselling, education and training activities, and the construction of clinics and other health facilities. UNFPA works with local authorities to implement initiatives aimed at preventing GBV, and to ensure that rapid and appropriate treatment and care is given to survivors of sexual violence. In some emergency settings UNFPA has established women-friendly spaces or worked to install solar lights to improve the security of public facilities. UNFPA’s multi-donor Humanitarian Thematic Fund, initiated in 2018, allocated US&#8201;$34m. to response initiatives during 2022.</p>
               <p>In December 2023 UNFPA appealed for US&#8201;$1,200m. to provide emergency support during 2024 to some 48m. women, girls and young people in 58 countries.
