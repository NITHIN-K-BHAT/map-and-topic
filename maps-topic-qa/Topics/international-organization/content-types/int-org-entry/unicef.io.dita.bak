          <p id="IO-UN.1232">UNICEF was established in 1946 as the UN International Children's Emergency Fund, with an initial focus on post-war Europe. In 1953 the General Assembly extended indefinitely UNICEF’s mandate, which had expanded to cover children in developing countries, and revised its name (retaining the same acronym). UNICEF works to promote the rights and wellbeing of all children, adolescents and women, and places particular emphasis on assisting the most vulnerable and disadvantaged.</p>

               <p>UNICEF reports on its activities to UN member states meeting in the General Assembly through its Executive Board, which is accountable to the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).</p>
               <p>The Executive Board comprises 36 member governments from all regions, elected in rotation for a three-year term by ECOSOC. As UNICEF’s governing body, the Board establishes policy, reviews programmes and approves expenditure. A Bureau is elected by the Board each year, comprising a President and four Vice-Presidents, representing five regional groupings. The Office of the Secretary of the Executive Board services the Board’s work and liaises with the Secretariat. </p>

Two optional protocols to the Convention were adopted in 2000, relating to the prevention of child combatants in armed conflict and the ending of the sale, sexual exploitation or abuse of children. A 2011 optional protocol permits the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child to undertake investigations of reported violations of child rights.</p>

         and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted in September 2015 by UN heads of state and of government. New goals and targets aimed at improving the lives of children that are incorporated into the SDGs include: ending all forms of malnutrition, including achieving internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under five years of age, and addressing the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women and older persons (SDG 2, Target 2.2); ending preventable deaths of newborn babies and children under five years of age, with all countries to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1,000 live births, and the under-five mortality rate to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births (SDG 3, Target 3.2); ensuring that all girls and boys have access to quality early childhood development, care and pre-primary education (SDG 4, Target 4.2); eliminating gender disparities in, and inequities in access to, education (Target 4.5); eliminating harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage, and female genital mutilation (SDG 5, Target 5.3); ending child labour in all its forms, including securing the prohibition and elimination of its worst forms, such as the military recruitment and use of children (SDG 8, Target 8.7); and ending the abuse, exploitation, trafficking, and all forms of violence against and torture of children (SDG 16, Target 16.2).

        SDG Target 3.2 requires a reduction by 2030 in the neonatal mortality rate to at least as low as 12 per 1,000 live births, globally, and of the under-five mortality rate to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births. Updated child mortality data is provided on an annual basis by the Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation, established in 2004 by UNICEF, the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Bank and the UN Population Division. The 2023 edition of the Group’s 
        <i>Levels and Trends in Child Mortality,</i>
         released in March 2024 , estimated the global under-five mortality rate in 2022 at 37 deaths per 1,000 live births; sub-Saharan Africa had the highest regional rate in that year, at 71 deaths per 1,000 live births. The global neonatal mortality rate was 17 deaths per 1,000 live births (sub-Saharan Africa: 27). In total 4.9m. children under the age of five died in 2022, largely of preventable or treatable causes. By comparison, some 12.5m. children under the age of five died in 1990. It reported that, by 2022, 59 countries were at risk of missing the under-five mortality target set for 2030, and 64 states were deemed to be at risk of missing the 2030 neonatal mortality target; families in sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia were particularly at risk. The global mortality rate in 2022 for children, adolescents and young people aged from five to 24 was estimated at 16 deaths per 1,000 (sub-Saharan Africa: 36). More than one-half of low- and middle-income countries were reported to have no reliable mortality data over the past five years.

               <p>Under the global Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health (PMNCH), established in 2005, UNICEF works with WHO, the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) and more than 1,300 other partners in countries with high maternal mortality to improve maternal health and prevent maternal and newborn deaths through the integration of a continuum of home, community, outreach and facility-based care, embracing every stage of maternal, newborn and child health. In August 2020 UNICEF and WHO jointly launched an updated Every Newborn Action Plan (ENAP), covering five strategic objectives to be pursued during 2020-25: (i) Strengthen and invest in care during labour, birth and the first day and week of life; (ii) Improve the quality of maternal and newborn care; (iii) Reach every woman and newborn to reduce inequities; (iv) Harness the power of parents, families and communities; and (v) Count every newborn: through measurement, programme-tracking and accountability.</p>
               <p usage="ewyb edio">UNICEF and partners work with governments and policymakers to ensure that antenatal and obstetric care is a priority in national health plans. UNICEF's activities in this area have included support for obstetric facilities, and training in, and advocacy of, women’s health issues, such as ending child marriage, preventing malaria and promoting the uptake of tetanus toxoid vaccinations and iron and folic acid supplements among pregnant women. The Fund promotes access to family planning services and recommends that births per mother should be spaced at least two years apart, as short birth spacing tends to raise the risk of prematurity and low birth weight. In February 2017 UNICEF, WHO and partners initiated, in nine developing countries, a new Network for Improving Quality of Care for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health.</p>

               <p usage="ewyb edio">In January 2021 UNICEF undertook the management of an emergency stockpile of a vaccine against Ebola Virus Disease that had been established in co-operation with other organizations and funded by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. In February the Fund began to organize the international transport of COVID-19 vaccines.</p>
               <p>Some 84% of children globally were estimated to have received three doses of the anti-diptheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP3) vaccine in 2022.</p>
               <p usage="ewyb edio ass">UNICEF, WHO, the UN Development Programme and the World Bank inaugurated `Roll Back Malaria’ in October 1998—a global campaign to combat the disease, which killed an estimated 1m. people each year at that time, the majority of whom were children in sub-Saharan Africa. UNICEF facilitates the distribution of highly subsidized insecticide-treated mosquito nets at community level.</p>
               <p>UNICEF works to improve safe water supply, sanitation and hygiene (`WASH’) and thereby reduce the risk of diarrhoea and other waterborne diseases, such as cholera, dysentery, Hepatitis A, and typhoid. It places great emphasis on increasing the testing and protection of drinking water, and on promoting the practice of thoroughly washing hands with soap. In March 2021 UNICEF estimated that 3,000m. people worldwide lacked basic hand washing facilities, such as soap and clean water, at home. UNICEF-assisted programmes for the control of diarrhoeal diseases promote the low-cost manufacture and distribution of prepackaged salts. In July 2022 UNICEF reported that each year the deaths of around 484,000 children under five years of age (primarily in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia) were caused by diarrhoea attributed to poor sanitation and to contaminated drinking water. UNICEF hosts the secretariat of a multi-stakeholder partnership, Sanitation and Water for All, which promotes, co-ordinates and monitors efforts to achieve SDG targets relating to WASH.</p>
               <p>UNICEF participates in the Steering Committee of UN-Nutrition, which was initiated in 2020 to co-ordinate UN agencies in advancing nutrition and eliminating hunger, malnutrition and obesity. UNICEF’s Executive Director chairs the SUN Movement Lead Group. According to UNICEF estimates, one-quarter of children under five years of age are underweight, while each year malnutrition contributes to more than one-third of child deaths in that age group and leaves millions of others with physical and mental disabilities. UNICEF supports national efforts to reduce malnutrition, for example, fortifying staple foods with micronutrients, widening women's access to education, improving the nutritional status of pregnant women, strengthening household food security and basic health services, providing food supplies in emergencies, and promoting sound childcare and feeding practices. In April 2015 UNICEF, the World Bank and other partners launched the Power of Nutrition, an independent fund that aimed to raise US&#8201;$200m., initially, towards ending child undernutrition. By 2024 more than 20,000 hospitals and birthing centres globally had been designated as `baby-friendly' and were promoting a set of UNICEF-WHO recommendations, the `Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding’.</p>
               <p>In 2022 it was estimated that, worldwide, 1.5m. children aged under 15 were living with HIV/AIDS (around 89% of whom were in Africa). Some 130,000 children were estimated to have been newly infected with HIV during that year. Only 57% of children who were living with HIV in 2022 had access to life-saving treatments. In 2022 an estimated 84,000 children died of AIDS-related causes.</p>
               <p usage="ewyb edio ass">As a result of HIV/AIDS—which had caused an estimated 13.8m. children in 2022 to be deprived of one or both of their parents—UNICEF is concerned that many children have suffered poverty, homelessness, discrimination, exploitation, and loss of education and other life opportunities. The Fund aims to provide expertise, support, logistical co-ordination and innovation towards ending the epidemic and limiting its impact on children and their mothers. Its priorities in this area include prevention of mother-to-child transmission (`PMCTC’); prevention of infection among young people (through, for example, support for education programmes and media campaigns); care and protection of orphans and other vulnerable children; and care and support for children, young people and parents living with HIV/AIDS. UNICEF works closely in this field with governments and co-operates with other UN agencies in the Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS).</p>

               <p usage="ass">During 2016-21 UNICEF implemented a Last Mile to Elimination of Mother-To-Child Transmission (EMTCT) framework in localities with high prevalence of HIV; by December 2021 an end to mother-to-child HIV transmission had been certified in 15 countries, including Botswana—the first country with a severe HIV epidemic to end mother-to-child transmission.</p>
               <p usage="ass">Despite representing one-tenth of the population of sub-Saharan Africa, adolescent girls and young women aged 15-24 accounted for one-quarter of new HIV infections there in 2020. In 2021 an estimated 250,000 adolescent girls and young women aged 15-24 globally were newly infected with HIV, of whom 82% were in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2020 Eswatini (with a score of 98%-98%-91%) was the only country globally to have achieved, with regard to children aged 0-14, the 90-90-90 target (set by UNAIDS in 2014) of at least 90% of people living with HIV being aware of their serostatus; at least 90% of these taking ART; and at least 90% being virally suppressed.</p>
               <p>In August 2022 UNICEF, UNAIDS, WHO and other partners established a Global Alliance for Ending AIDS in Children by 2030.</p>

UNICEF works with the International Labour Organization and other partners to promote an end to exploitative and hazardous child labour, and supports special projects to provide education, counselling and care in developing countries.</p>
               <p>UNICEF has issued programme guidance related to social and behaviour change, and maintains a virtual Behavioural Insights Research and Design laboratory (BIRDLAB), which focuses on innovatively using social and behavioural sciences insights to improve outcomes for children.</p>
               <p>With a view to incorporating provisions for the protection of migrant children, UNICEF actively participated in the intergovernmental discussions to formulate a Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, which was adopted in December 2018. In May 2022 UNICEF and the International Organization on Migration agreed a Strategic Collaboration Framework aimed at protecting the rights of migrant children.</p>
               <p>In June 2023 UNICEF reported that 43.3m. children worldwide were living in forced displacement: 25.8m. internally, and 17.5m. as refugees and asylum seekers. The Fund helps to supply humanitarian assistance to displaced children, works to promote their rights, and often establishes child-friendly spaces within refugee camps. UNICEF estimates that some 1.2m. children worldwide are trafficked each year. It promotes ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography. In June 2016 a Global Interagency Working Group issued a set of Terminology Guidelines for the Protection of Children from Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse (the `Luxembourg Guidelines’).</p>

        In 2005 the UN Security Council established the Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism (MRM) on Grave Violations Against Children in Situations of Armed Conflict, addressing: the killing and maiming of children; recruitment and use of children by armed forces and armed groups (as soldiers, spies, cooks, etc.); sexual violence against children; attacks against schools or hospitals; abduction of children; and denial of humanitarian access for children. In an affected country UNICEF’s local representative and the in-country Resident Coordinator co-chair a Country Task Force on Monitoring and Reporting (CTFMR), established with a mandate to manage the MRM at local level. UNICEF encourages ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict (known as the OPAC), which was adopted by the General Assembly in May 2000 and entered into force in February 2002, and bans the compulsory recruitment of ­combatants below the age of 18 years. The Fund also urges states to make unequivocal statements endorsing 18 years as the minimum age of voluntary recruitment to the armed forces. UNICEF, with Save the Children, co-chairs the Steering Group of the Paris Principles, which aims to support the implementation of a series of `Commitments and Guidelines’—first endorsed by an international conference convened by UNICEF and the French Government in Paris, France, in February 2007—to end the recruitment of children, support the release of children from the armed forces and facilitate their reintegration into civilian life. In December 2022 the Steering Group issued an advisory

               <p>UNICEF and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General (SRSG) for Children and Armed Conflict co-chair the Global Coalition for Reintegration of Child Soldiers, established in 2018, with broad UN and civil society participation. In this framework former child combatants and other stakeholders have contributed to the development of recommendations aimed at supporting programming on reintegration into peaceful society. In 2021 UNICEF and the SRSG initiated the related Nairobi Process, focused on the effective reintegration of former child fighters. During 2022 UNICEF extended reintegration or other protection support to nearly 12,500 children who had left armed forces and groups. During the period 2005-22 the UN verified 315,000 incidents of grave violations perpetrated against children in conflict situations—including killing and maiming, and also more than 16,000 attacks against schools and hospitals. UNICEF estimated that at the end of 2023 some 460m. children worldwide were living in conflict zones.</p>

The Fund emphasizes that the practices of early marriage and adolescent motherhood typically lead to girls ceasing their education, thereby losing potential economic and health benefits, as well as being at greater risk of suffering complications in pregnancy and childbirth and of having premature or low birth weight babies. On 11 October UNICEF celebrates the International Day of the Girl Child (approved by the UN General Assembly in December 2011).</p>

               <p>UNICEF works to ensure that children live in a safe and clean environment, in particular advocating for improved air quality, and supports the active involvement of youth in the implementation of climate adaptation strategies and response plans.</p>
               <p usage="edio">In September 2019 16 child climate activists from 12 countries filed a formal complaint to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child against Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany and Turkey (now known as Türkiye), alleging that, as states parties to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, their failure adequately to address the climate crisis constituted a violation of child rights. They urged governments to take action to protect children from the adverse impacts of climate change, such as pressures on food and water security and on liveable environments. In October 2021 the Committee ruled that their case was inadmissible, and should be presented first to relevant national courts—while acknowledging states’ legal responsibility for the negative impacts of carbon emissions on children both within and beyond their territories.</p>
               <p usage="ewyb edio sasia mena fea ass">The right to a name and nationality is enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child. UNICEF promotes universal registration of births in order to prevent the abuse of children without proof of age and nationality, for example through trafficking, forced labour, early marriage and military recruitment. The Fund provides support for the enactment of legislation, and policies and standards that advance free and universal birth registration. It has facilitated the organization of birth registration data in rural areas of developing countries through text ­messaging. UNICEF estimated in 2022 that, globally, 75% of children below the age of five were registered (compared with 63% in 2009). UNICEF has stated concern that significant numbers of registered children nevertheless lack a certificate or formal proof of registration.</p>

        UNICEF works, including through the extension of technical and policy support, to ensure that all children receive equal access to quality education, which it identifies as a fundamental human right. UNICEF advocates the implementation of the Child Friendly School model, designed to facilitate the delivery of safe, quality education. In September 2019 UNICEF and the International Telecommunication Union launched a Giga initiative, which aimed to ensure internet connectivity for every school. In March 2020 UNICEF, with WHO and the International Committee of the Red Cross, issued guidance to support schools in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, including on the implementation of educational strategies to maintain learning in the event of school closures. 
        <publ-name>The State of Global Learning Poverty: 2022 Update,</publ-name>
         released in June of that year by UNICEF, the World Bank and other partners, warned that disruptions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic—which had caused an average global loss of 141 in-person schooling days during February 2020-February 2022—had significantly worsened (already widespread) learning poverty (measured as the number of children who have not acquired a minimal level of proficiency in literacy by age 10). The report observed that in 2019 the average global learning poverty rate in low- and middle-income countries had been 57% (with a peak of 86% in sub-Saharan Africa). Lack of internet access and connectivity were reported to have widely increased reliance on television and radio as learning sources during school closures. The report recommended a framework of policy interventions, devised with input from UNICEF, to accelerate learning.

               <p usage="ewyb edio sasia ass mena">In May 2016 UNICEF released a report which found that—although one-quarter of school-age children globally (some 462m. children) were living in humanitarian emergency-affected countries—education accounted for a negligible proportion (2%) of funds requested under humanitarian appeals. A fund, Education Cannot Wait (ECW), was launched at the inaugural World Humanitarian Summit, held later in May, in İstanbul, Türkiye, with a view to increasing access to learning opportunities for children living through emergencies. The fund, which aimed to support 75m. children by 2030, has a First Emergency-Response Window, a Multi-Year Resilience Window, and an Acceleration Facility (which supports activities and research to improve crisis preparedness and response). In February 2023 donors committed more than US&#8201;$826m. to ECW for the period 2023-26.</p>

Revised CCCs were issued in October 2020 to incorporate best practices in providing quality, prompt humanitarian support during fast-moving emergency situations. Within the UN system’s `Cluster Approach’, developed to co-ordinate the international response to human­itarian disasters, UNICEF is the lead agency for Education (jointly with Save The Children); Nutrition; and WASH.</p>
               <p>UNICEF aims to ensure the uninterrupted provision of education during emergencies. The Fund works to secure (and where necessary to reconstruct) safe learning spaces that are equipped with WASH facilities, to procure learning materials, to train teachers, and to support governments in the use of disaster risk reduction strategies. Emergency education assistance extended by UNICEF includes the provision of `school-in-a-box' kits in refugee camps, the supply of flashlights to protect girls and women at night, and the organization, in co-operation with WHO, of outreach campaigns to enable the immunization of children in conflict zones. Through the Giga initiative (q.v.) the Office supports distance learning during emergencies.

          Under UNICEF’s 2023 humanitarian appeal, US&#8201;$1,878m. was allocated to West and Central Africa. Some $862m. was requested to fund UNICEF’s emergency humanitarian operations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in that year, including the provision of safe water for 3.4m. people; facilitating access to education (both informal and formal) for 1.7m. children; enabling access to community-based mental health and psychosocial support for 2m. children and caregivers; and treating around 995,800 children with severe acute malnutrition. For 2023 UNICEF also requested, 
          <i>inter alia,</i>
           $270m. to provide assistance in Nigeria, in particular in northern areas affected by Boko Haram and inter-communal violence, $227m. to fund operations in Burkina Faso, and $115m. for Mali.

                    <p usage="edio ass">The Eastern and Southern Africa region was allocated US&#8201;$1,639m. in the 2023 humanitarian appeal. UNICEF requested $674m. to fund its emergency humanitarian operations in Ethiopia, which were to include enabling 2.1m. children and women to access primary health care, facilitating access to community-based mental health and psychosocial support for more than 275,000 children and caregivers, providing safe WASH services in learning facilities for 7.3m. children, and treating 1.2m. children for severe acute malnutrition. Some $272m. was requested to fund activities in Somalia, and $217m. for South Sudan. Sudan (which UNICEF classifies as part of its Middle East and North Africa region) was initially allocated $585m. in assistance—augmented to $838m. following the outbreak in April of civil conflict in that country; at mid-2023 UNICEF reported that 13.6m. children in Sudan required humanitarian support.</p>
                    <p usage="edio africa">In early 2024 UNICEF was helping to combat an outbreak of cholera that had arisen in eastern and southern Africa (by 3 March 2024 more than 335,000 cases had been reported in 18 countries since 1 January 2022, and five countries—the DRC, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe—were reported to be in `acute crisis’). Activities being undertaken by UNICEF included the delivery of treatment and prevention supplies (such as rapid diagnostic kits, antibiotics, sachets of oral rehydration salts, IV fluids and equipment, zinc sulphate tablets, water purifying tablets, and oral cholera vaccines); mass messaging on infection prevention and control; and the rehabilitation of water and sanitation infrastructure.</p>

        The Fund promotes the collection and analysis of statistical data relating to the wellbeing of children and women. UNICEF’s Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) method of household data collection, initiated in 1995, analyses data on child protection, education (including remote learning), health (including HIV/AIDS and COVID-19), nutrition, and water and sanitation. By March 2024 390 MICS surveys had been completed. The seventh MICS round was initiated in March 2023. A MICS Plus initiative, which uses mobile phones to supplement existing household data, was launched in October 2018.
