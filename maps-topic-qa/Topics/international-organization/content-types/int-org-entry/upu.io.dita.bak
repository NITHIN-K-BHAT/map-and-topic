          <p id="IO-UN.2421.1">The General Postal Union was founded by the Treaty of Bern (1874), beginning operations in July 1875. Three years later its name was changed to the Universal Postal Union (UPU). In 1948 the UPU became a specialized agency of the UN. The UPU promotes the sustainable development of high-quality, universal, efficient and accessible postal services, and provides a forum for co-operation between postal sector stakeholders.</p>

        The Council is composed of representatives of 41 member countries, elected by the Universal Postal Congress on the basis of an equitable geographical distribution. Meeting annually (2024: late April-early May), it is responsible for the affairs of the Union between Congresses, supervising the International Bureau and approving the Union’s budget. The Council also considers policies that may affect other sectors, such as standardization and quality of service, provides a forum for considering the implications of governmental policies with respect to competition, deregulation and trade-in-service issues for international postal services, and considers intergovernmental aspects of technical co-operation. The Council is responsible for promoting and co-ordinating all aspects of technical assistance among member countries. A Conference on Postal Regulation is convened during each session of the Council.

The POC has the authority to amend and enact the Detailed Regulations of the Universal Postal Convention, on the basis of decisions made at Congress. It promotes analysis undertaken by some postal services and the introduction of new postal products. It also prepares and issues recommendations concerning uniform standards of practice. On the recommendation of the 1999 Beijing Congress the POC established a Standards Board with responsibility for approving standards relating to telematics, postal technology and Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). Revised regulations on letter post and parcel international regulations entered into force on 1 January 2014. The following bodies report to the Postal Operations Council: the Direct Marketing Advisory Board (comprising representatives of designated national posts, private companies and industry associations); Express Mail Service (EMS) Cooperative (comprising, as at February 2024, 175 EMS designated operators covering most global EMS traffic; regulates the provision of a high-quality, competitive global EMS service); Telematics Cooperative (which, with voluntary participation by public, semi-public, and private postal operators, supports the use of new technologies in the improvement and expansion of postal services); Quality Service Fund (QSF) Board (which supports service improvements in developing member states); and the .POST Group (which steers the .POST top-level domain name).</p>

The Congress also adopted a new Integrated Remuneration Plan. The UPU’s Postal Vision 2030 is aimed at aligning the organization’s mission with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It has four key areas of action: (i) implementing focused policies and strengthening investment to reduce gaps in postal development, and advancing the use of postal networks to achieve socioeconomic development; (ii) harmonizing and enhancing postal regulatory frameworks; (iii) improving the performance of postal operators, including by means of diversification; and (iv) promoting the integration into the postal sector of public institutions and private sector stakeholders.</p>

               <p>The Abidjan Postal Strategy is focused on achieving the UPU’s Postal Vision 2030, and is based on the following three pillars: (i) strengthen the UPU’s mandate as the principal forum for postal sector development; (ii) reinforce the UPU’s role as a provider of innovative and affordable technical solutions for postal sector stakeholders; and (iii) enable the UPU to become the postal sector’s foremost information and knowledge centre.</p>
               <p>A UPU Strategy Summit was convened in October 2023, during the fourth extraordinary Congress (in Riyadh), to inform a successor Dubai Postal Strategy. This was to be approved in 2025 by the 28th ordinary Congress.</p>

               <heading>Digital Services</heading>
               <p>The UPU promotes the use of digital technologies and innovative solutions in the postal sector, with a focus on research and development, capacity building, and the provision of technical assistance. The Union conducts market analysis to assist postal administrations in adapting to globalization and technological advances in world markets, and aims to reduce the digital divide between industrialized and developing nations. A Postal Data Hackathon event organized by the Union in June 2023 focused on analysis of the worldwide movement of goods through postal networks. The UPU sponsors the .POST top-level internet domain, which is authorized for exclusive use by the postal sector. Under the UPU Cybersecurity Framework several policy recommendations have been approved to enable member countries to build their capabilities to strengthen the security and resilience of digitalized postal processes and services. The UPU Secure E-services Framework comprises tools and legal instruments that facilitate the interconnection of national postal services. Through its Connect.post programme the Union aims to link all post offices worldwide to the internet by 2030. A UPU E-Commerce Programme (ECOMPRO) was initiated in 2014. The UPU is a founding member of the UN eTrade-for-all initiative, which aims to support participation by least developed countries in e-commerce. In May 2022 the UPU and WCO signed a co-operation accord that provided for enhanced co-operation in developing e-commerce and postal network security. A UPU Multilateral Data Sharing Agreement (MDSA) was adopted in April 2021 by the Postal Technology Centre. By 2024 the Union had issued digital capability recommendation reports based on assessments conducted in 10 developing countries.</p>

               <heading>Physical Services</heading>
               <p>The UPU has observed that, while the volume of traditional letter mail has declined in recent years, small parcel deliveries have been boosted by e-commerce. The UPU’s Global Monitoring System (GMS) measures postal performance through the GMS Statistical System for Analysis and Reports (GMS STAR). The Union’s International Bureau undertakes quality tests on postal products and services worldwide, monitoring international links through the use of test letters and parcels; the Bureau also publishes end-to-end delivery standards. Consultants are sent to selected countries to promote the implementation of improvements in quality of service. The UPU works to advance the global address infrastructure by supporting the development of national addressing and postcode systems and by helping to advance the international interoperability of name and address data. The Union fosters postal supply chain integration. An Integrated Product Plan approved in September 2018 by the second UPU extraordinary Congress aims to develop an integrated portfolio of physical (letter, parcel and EMS) postal products.</p>
               <p>The UPU sets the rates of remuneration for cross-border postal deliveries. In September 2019 the third extraordinary Congress concluded a unanimous agreement on a new postal renumerations rate regime, which included an option of self-declared rates—in effect since 1 July 2020—for countries where inbound letter and small parcel post volume exceeds 75,000 metric tons. (The USA had previously advised the organization that it intended to withdraw its membership if this issue was not promptly addressed.) In September 2021 the 27th Congress adopted a new Integrated Remuneration System that aimed to integrate the UPU’s `terminal dues’ renumeration system (initiated in 1969), inward land rates, ECOMPRO rates, and EMS rates. The UPU issues a yearly compendium of transit charges, for intermediate third-party designated operators that forward postal items to a destination country.</p>
               <p>
        The UPU develops regulations, processes and best practices to facilitate efficient movement through the cross-border postal supply chain, with a focus on security, transport and customs. The UPU’s Postal Security Group is tasked with developing security strategies at the global and regional levels with the aim of preventing mail-related fraud, theft and misuse. In March 2007 the UPU and the

        An electronic UPU clearing system (UPU*Clearing) became operational in 2003, for the settlement of international postal accounts. The 2008 Congress adopted an optional Postal Payment Services (PPS) Agreement and its Regulations, which aimed to enable postal operators to operate faster, more secure and more accessible electronic money transfer services to communities without access to banks or other formal money transfer networks. A PPS*Clearing system and PPS User Group have been established. In October 2023 the fourth extraordinary Congress agreed reforms to the PPS system, in particular to facilitate broader engagement with WPSPs. UPU supports the use by member states of the trademarked PosTransfer system, to facilitate the real-time exchange of international electronic money transfers. The UPU’s Postal Economics Programme conducts economic research aimed at analysing the uneven postal sector development of developing countries and providing growth models for their postal sectors. Focus has been given to expanding the role of national postal administrations in such countries in supporting the use of e-commerce activities by micro and small enterprises. Through its Financial Inclusion Technical Assistance Facility (FITAF) the UPU supports projects providing digital financial services support to impoverished and `unbanked’ people (i.e. excluded from mainstream financial institutions) in Africa, Asia and the Pacific. A Japan Fund for Postal Financial Inclusion was initiated in mid-2020 to support UPU initiatives aimed at promoting financial inclusion in developing countries. In April 2022 the UPU issued 
        <publ-name>Blockchains for a Sustainable Postal Future,</publ-name>
         which addressed the onwards use of blockchain and distributed ledger technologies (DLTS—systems that enable simultaneous record updating across multiple access points), with a focus on advancing inclusive financial services and logistics.

The organization maintains an online tool— the Online Solution for Carbon Analysis and Reporting (OSCAR)—which measures the carbon footprint of postal operations. In October 2023 the Union’s fourth extraordinary Congress endorsed a `Green Package’ that included targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions within the postal sector, and the establishment of a voluntarily-funded Climate Facility to support mitigation and adaptation activities. A global disaster risk reduction and management policy for the postal sector is under development.</p>
