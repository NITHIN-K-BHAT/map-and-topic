It aims to alleviate acute hunger by providing emergency relief in humanitarian disaster situations. It also assists vulnerable populations in developing countries to improve nutrition, to eradicate chronic undernourishment, and to further social advancement by developing assets and promoting self-reliance. WFP was awarded the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize.</p>

          <heading>Activities</heading>
          <p>WFP is the frontline UN agency in combating hunger. It focuses its efforts on the world's poorest countries, and aims to provide at least 90% of its total assistance to those designated as `low-income food-deficit'. WFP has a particular focus on UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 (Zero Hunger); and SDG 17 (on achieving the Goals through strategic partnerships). A Country Strategic Plan (CSP) framework initiated by WFP in 2016 introduced a system of (standard) CSPs and (interim) ICSPs that were to be aligned flexibly to national priorities. WFP’s Strategic Plan for 2022-26 focused on achieving the following five outcomes: People are better able to meet their urgent food and nutrition needs; People have better nutrition, health and education outcomes; People have improved and sustainable livelihoods; National programmes and systems are strengthened; and Humanitarian and development actors are more efficient and effective. A WFP management plan for 2024-26, approved by the Executive Board in November 2023, envisaged that in 2024 77% of resources would be allocated to crisis response operations, 20% to resilience-building activities, and 3% to addressing the root causes of food insecurity. In-kind food transfers were to account for around one-half WFP assistance in 2024, and cash-based transfers for 36%. Commodity vouchers (redeemable against fixed quantities of specific foods) were to be used for about 4% of assistance. During 2024 WFP aimed to extend support to 157m. people, through 88 operations.</p>
          <p>WFP manages active trust funds for special purposes outside its regular operational programmes, with a view to supporting CSPs, in areas such as enhancing food security and nutrition, the development of supply chains, innovation acceleration, strengthening government capacities, and improving climate change and disaster risk resilience.</p>
          <p>WFP aims to combat poverty in developing countries by promoting self-reliant families and communities. It emphasizes training and capacity-building elements within relief operations, such as income-generating activities and environmental protection measures; and seeks to integrate elements that strengthen disaster mitigation into development projects, including soil conservation, reafforestation, irrigation infrastructure, and transport construction and rehab­ilitation. No indiv­idual country is permitted to receive more than 10% of the Programme’s available development resources.</p>
          <p>A WFP Innovation Accelerator was established in 2015 to promote new initiatives in areas including health care, gender equality, climate change adaptation and emergency response. In February 2024 a global headquarters for the Innovation Accelerator was inaugurated, in Munich, Germany.</p>
          <p-group>
               <heading>Emergency Preparedness and Response</heading>
               <p>WFP uses geographic information systems to manage and visualize incoming data on crisis situations. Through its Vulnerability Analysis and Mapping (VAM) initiative the agency aims to identify potentially vulnerable groups of people, and efficiently to focus emergency contingency-planning and long-term assistance activities.</p>
               <p usage="edio">VAM produces food security analysis reports, guidelines, reference documents, and an interactive map highlighting food insecurity hotspots. An mVAM (mobile VAM) project tracks real-time food security trends.</p>
               <p>WFP maintains the UN Human­itarian Response Depot—a network of five hubs, based in Accra, Ghana; Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Panama City, Panama; and Brindisi, Italy—stores essential rapid response equipment. Within the UN’s `Cluster Approach' to co-ordinating the international response to human­itarian disasters, WFP is a joint lead agency for the clusters on Emergency Telecommunications, and Logistics and Food Security, and is also actively involved in the Nutrition Cluster. WFP also manages the UN Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS). When engaging in a crisis WFP dispatches an emergency preparedness team to quantify the amount and type of food assistance required, and to identify the beneficiaries, timescale and logistics underpinning the ensuing assistance programme. Emergency Food Security Assessments, either prompt or indepth, analyse the impact of a crisis on households and community food security.</p>
               <p>The inaugural meeting was convened in April 2021 of a High-Level Task Force on Preventing Famine, created in March by the UN Secretary-General. In February 2022 WFP’s Executive Director warned that the interaction of climate shocks and conflict, compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic and rising prices for food and essential supplies, was causing mounting starvation, mass migration, and destabilization. In March WFP emphasized the need to find solutions to the further shock to global food and energy prices prompted by the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine. (Russia and Ukraine were major exporters of cereals to the global markets, Ukraine also of sunflower oil, and Russia of crude and processed petroleum and of fertilizers.) WFP was invited to engage with a joint G7-World Bank Global Alliance for Food Security that was launched in May at a meeting of G7 ministers responsible for development. In July negotiations held in İstanbul, Türkiye, under the auspices of the UN and Türkiye, culminated in the conclusion of the UN-backed Black Sea Grain Initiative (BSGI), aimed at alleviating global food insecurity by enabling the resumption of exports of grain, sunflower oil and other essential goods from Odesa and two other Ukrainian Black Sea ports (that had hitherto been blockaded by Russia), and at facilitating fertilizer and grain exports from Russia (which had been subjected to punitive sanctions). Extensions to the BSGI were subsequently agreed; however, on 17 July 2023 the initiative lapsed, the Russian authorities having refused to renew it, claiming that commitments made to Russia had not been fulfilled. During July 2022-15 June 2023 shipments of 31.8m. metric tons of food commodities were facilitated through the initiative.</p>
               <p usage="ewyb edio">In early February 2023 WFP’s Executive Director and the heads of FAO, the World Bank Group, International Monetary Fund and World Trade Organization issued a joint statement in which they called for further urgent collective actions (i) to rescue hunger hotspots: through supporting country-level efforts to strengthen crisis preparedness, share information, and address local needs; (ii) to facilitate trade (including supporting measures aimed at increasing the availability of food and fertilizers and strengthening the provision of public goods), to improve the functioning of markets, and to strengthen the role of the private sector; and (iii) to reform harmful subsidies and repurpose them towards initiatives promoting global food security and sustainable food systems.</p>

               <heading>Strengthening Food Systems</heading>
               <p>WFP has warned that disruption to food systems through conflict drives many of the world’s food crises—displacing farmers, devastating food stocks and agricultural assets, disrupting supply chains and markets, driving up prices, and harming livelihoods; and that abrupt disruptions to food systems can also arise from shocks related to climate change and to reliance on global supply chains. Furthermore, systematically poor transportation networks and storage facilities, and unpredictable commercial markets can disrupt access to food. WFP interventions that strengthen local food systems include the establishment and rehabilitation of relevant infrastructure in exchange for cash assistance or food; and supporting and engaging local smallholder farmers (for example through a Home Grown School Meals initiative and locally sourced nutrition fortification programmes).</p>
               <p>WFP, FAO, IFAD and the UN Secretary-General collectively undertook preparations for a Food Systems Summit (FSS) that was held in September 2021, with a view to raising global awareness of challenges related to the production, processing and consumption of food, and to improving the output of safe, nutritious food. In January 2022, to support the follow-up to the FSS, a co-ordination hub was launched, under the joint leadership of WFP, FAO and IFAD. The inaugural global FSS+2 Stocktaking Moment (post-FSS review meeting) was convened in July 2023, in Rome, Italy.</p>

               <p>WFP recognizes that undernutrition—the insufficient intake of nutrients—undermines energy and health, that poor nutrition can also lead to obesity and be a contributory factor in a variety of non-communicable diseases, and that extreme malnutrition can, as well as being potentially fatal, cause stunting and impaired development in children. The impacts of malnutrition can also have the onwards consequences of undermining economies and impeding sustainable development. WFP implements targeted programmes that prevent and treat malnutrition in high-risk groups such as young children, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and people who are living with HIV or tuberculosis. WFP contributes to the implementation of the Decade of Action on Nutrition (2016-25), declared in April 2016 by the UN General Assembly.</p>
               <p>Where used, full WFP rations comprise essential food items (staple foods such as wheat flour or rice; pulses such as lentils and chickpeas; vegetable oil fortified with vitamins A and D; sugar; and iodized salt). Supplementary rations (such as fortified blended foods) are designed to improve the nutritional intake of beneficiaries who have access to some food supplies.</p>
               <p usage="ewyb edio">WFP participates (with FAO, UNICEF, IFAD, IAEA, UNEP and WHO) in the Steering Committee of UN-Nutrition, which was inaugurated in 2020 to co-ordinate UN agencies in advancing nutrition and eliminating hunger, malnutrition and obesity. Given that it is difficult for children to concentrate without adequate food and nutrition, and that food-insecure households frequently have to choose between educating their children or making them work to help the family to survive, WFP supports the educational opportunities of disadvantaged children over the age of two years through school feeding activities. A WFP School Feeding Strategy that was being implemented during 2020-30 aimed to scale up school health and nutrition to support `human capital’.</p>

        WFP aims to enable farmers to protect their enterprises from the impacts of climatic shocks—such as droughts, floods and tropical storms—noting that, after conflict situations, climate extremes represent the next major threat to food security and livelihoods, having the capacity to destroy crop production and local infrastructures, and to disrupt markets. WFP (including through the Weather Risk Management Facility, a joint initiative with IFAD) promotes access to climate information services and forecast-based financing systems, and also facilitates access to agriculture output index-based macro- and microinsurance schemes. Such activities are increasingly supported by funding mechanisms such as the Green Climate Fund (see 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="IO-UN.1369">UNEP</xr>
        ). WFP also supports governments with incorporating climate risk assessments into their planning, and with accessing funding for priority climate risk management activities.

               <heading>Food Assistance for Assets (FFA)</heading>
               <p>WFP’s FFA projects focus on enhancing long-term food security by meeting the immediate nourishment requirements of food-insecure people (through food rations or cash-based transfers), thereby providing them with more energy and time to work on building lasting sustainable community assets, and to undertake livelihood and self sufficiency enhancing activities. FFA projects include, for example, building new irrigation or terracing infrastructures; soil and water conservation activities; and constructing schools and health clinics. The implementation, where possible, of targeted cash assistance (including mobile and e-money, physical cash, debit cards, and e- or else card vouchers) to buy food, including fresh produce, boosts local output as well as retail activities, and simultaneously reduces the Programme’s food transportation and storage costs. The value of virtual money and vouchers can be increased or reduced depending upon the severity of an emergency situation. WFP’s SCOPE digital platform stores data on individual and household beneficiaries and facilitates the management of WFP transfers. WFP continues to provide basic rations in emergency situations, and special nutrition support where needed. It is WFP policy to buy food as near as possible to the communities that require it. In more than 40 developing countries WFP works to build the capacity of smallholder and low-income farmers to compete competitively in the market place.</p>

The Programme estimates that females represent four-fifths of people engaged in farming in Africa and three-fifths of people engaged in farming in Asia, and that globally women are the sole breadwinners in one-third of households. WFP has worked to demonstrate that gender equality is fundamental to ensuring food security and nutrition, with a view to supporting related advocacy and programming. In 2018 WFP undertook a study in six pilot countries to assess how cash-based transfers can contribute to gender equality, and, with FAO, helped to develop a Gender and Age marker to assess how women, men, girls and boys are supported by WFP’s programming.</p>

From October, in view of the devastating escalation of the Hamas-Israel conflict, and imposition by Israel of a `complete siege’ on Gaza, WFP called consistently for a humanitarian ceasefire and continuous, safe humanitarian access to the enclave, while expanding its operations to provide emergency food and (initially, until shops ran out of food supplies) cash assistance to 1.4m. people there. Nutrition support included deliveries of food parcels, fortified biscuits and wheat flour, complementary feeding for pregnant and breastfeeding women, and support to bakeries, as well as to community-led kitchens that were providing hot meals. In February 2024 WFP reported that it urgently required $314m. to continue its assistance to Gaza until the end of April. As at February, the entire population of Gaza was reported to be experiencing crisis or worse levels of acute food insecurity, and more than 500,000 people in the enclave were believed by WFP to be on the brink of famine. An estimated 300,000 hard-to-reach people isolated in northern Gaza were of particular concern; WFP deliveries to the north were intermittently suspended in view of extreme insecurity.</p>

The freezing of much foreign aid and extreme economic shock that followed the takeover of power by the Taliban in August 2021 further contributed to a critical level of food insecurity. An IPC analysis undertaken in October 2023 reported that 13.1m. people in Afghanistan were experiencing very acute food insecurity. During July 2018-December 2025 WFP was implementing an Afghanistan CSP, at a cost of US&#8201;$9,820m.</p>
                    <p usage="ewyb edio sasia">WFP was implementing a US $1,620m. CSP in Bangladesh during 2022-26. In 2024 WFP aimed to provide monthly food assistance to up to 943,000 Myanma Rohingya refugees sheltering in that country’s Cox’s Bazar region and Bhasan Char Island. The Rohingya refugees in Cox’s Bazar have been supported through the provision of e-vouchers, the extension of nutrition assistance, school feeding, the supply of vegetables, chicken and fish to vulnerable beneficiaries through local markets and `Fresh Food Corners’ located at 25 WFP `aggregation centres’, and through infrastructure connectivity improvements and livelihoods support. Malnutrition prevention and treatment services are extended to nursing mothers and children at dedicated nutrition sites across the Cox’s Bazar encampments.</p>

Meanwhile, other CSPs were being implemented to support neighbouring countries hosting substantial numbers of Venezuelans who had fled the ongoing extreme socioeconomic crisis. These included a $856m. CSP for Colombia (hosting an estimated 2.8m. Venezuelans at August 2023), which was underway during the period 2021-24; a $144m.

                    <p usage="ewyb edio ass">In February 2023 the WFP Executive Board endorsed a US&#8201;$1,436m. CSP for Nigeria, covering the period 1 March 2023-28 February 2027, which aimed to strengthen local and national capacities to meet food and nutrition requirements (with a focus on insecure north-eastern areas), and to foster more productive and inclusive food systems. During 2023-28 WFP was supporting the second phase of a Sahel Integrated Resilience Programme, focused on boosting community adaptation to climate change and ecosystem degradation in Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger. In September 2019 WFP declared the Central Sahel region (Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger)—undermined by climatic shocks, insecurity, displacement and poverty—to be a Level 3 Emergency. The IPC forecast that 480,000 children under five years of age in Burkina Faso would face elevated levels of acute malnutrition during August 2023-July 2024. Some 7.1m. people in South Sudan were reported by WFP in early 2024 to be food-insecure; a $3,771m. CSP was being undertaken there during 2023-25, targeting 2.1m. beneficiaries. Meanwhile, during 2019-24 a $4,176m. CSP, supporting 15.6m. people, was underway in Sudan; by February 2024 forced displacement and other impacts of the conflict that erupted in Sudan in April 2023 were reported by WFP to be affecting 25m. people across that country, South Sudan, and Chad. Within Sudan an estimated 18m. people were acutely food insecure, and 3.8m. children under the age of five were malnourished.</p>
                    <p usage="ewyb edio ass">A CSP being undertaken in Ethiopia during 1 July 2020-30 June 2025, at a cost of US $5,021m., aimed to ensure that 25.6m. beneficiaries in crisis-affected populations (including refugees) met their basic food and nutrition requirements. In particular, the Plan was to support vulnerable and food-insecure populations to establish shock-resilient livelihoods and increase consumption of nutritious foods; to strengthen the capacity of emergency preparedness systems; to improve safety nets and supply chains management; and to facilitate cost-effective logistics. Meanwhile, a $1,941m. Somalia CSP, covering the period January 2022-December 2025, was focused on crisis response and building resilience. In February 2024 the IPC estimated that (given the impacts of drought, flooding, conflict, displacement, insufficient access for humanitarian workers, and a decline in humanitarian funding), 1.7m. children in Somalia would be at risk of acute malnutrition during that year. A $1,434m. CSP was being implemented in Kenya during mid-2023-mid-2027.</p>
                    <p usage="ewyb edio ass">In October 2017 WFP declared a Level 3 Emergency in response to food insecurity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), focused on the conflict-affected regions of North Kivu, South Kivu, Ituri, Kasaï and Tanganyika. By early 2024 WFP estimated that 5.4m. people in the Kivus and Ituri were highly food-insecure, and that 2.8m. children in the DRC were suffering acute malnutrition. A US&#8201;$1,674m. CSP for the DRC, was being implemented during the period 1 January 2021-31 December 2024. In February 2023 the Executive Board approved a $1,106m. CSP to be undertaken in the Central African Republic from 1 March 2023-31 December 2027.</p>
