          <p>WHO is the UN system‚Äôs co-ordinating authority for health (defined as `a state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity'). WHO's objective is stated in its Constitution as `the attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health'. It aims to provide leadership on global public health matters, in partnership with other agencies, as well as to help to shape the global health research agenda, and to monitor and assess health trends. WHO provides technical and policy support to member countries and extends aid following emergencies and natural disasters.</p>
          <p>
      WHO supports the pursuit of the 
      <xr id="IO-UNDP.001" pageref="N">Sustainable Development Goals</xr>
       (SDGs), which were designed to contribute‚Äîeither directly or indirectly‚Äîto improved global health. SDG 3 explicitly aimed `to ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages‚Äô, and was underpinned by some 13 health targets to be achieved by 2030. These included reducing the maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births; ending preventable deaths of newborns, to at least as low as 12 per 1,000 live births, and lowering the under-five mortality rate to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births; ending the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis (TB), malaria, and neglected tropical diseases, and combating hepatitis, water-borne diseases and other communicable diseases; reducing by one-third‚Äîthrough prevention and treatment‚Äîpremature mortality from non-communicable diseases (NCDs); promoting mental health and wellbeing; ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive health services; strengthening prevention and treatment of substance abuse; enhancing the implementation of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control; substantially lowering numbers of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals, environmental pollution and contamination; ensuring UHC, including financial risk protection, and access to high-quality essential healthcare services, essential medicines and vaccines for all; advancing research, development and affordability of vaccines and essential medicines for those communicable and NCDs that mainly impact developing countries; significantly increasing health financing and the recruitment, development and training of the health workforce in developing countries; strengthening the capacity of all countries, in particular developing countries, for early warning, risk reduction and management of national and global health risks; and reducing by one-half the number of global deaths and injuries arising from road traffic accidents.

        WHO keeps diseases and other health problems under constant surveillance, promotes the exchange of prompt and accurate information and of notification of outbreaks of diseases, and administers the binding 2005 International Health Regulations, which aim to support the international community in preventing and reacting to severe potentially transboundary public health risks. Within the UN system, WHO co-ordinates the international response to emergencies and natural disasters in the health field, in close co-operation with other agencies. In this context, WHO provides expert advice on epidemiological surveillance, control of communicable diseases, public health information, and health emergency training. Its emergency preparedness activities include co-ordination, policymaking and planning, awareness-building, technical advice, training, publication of standards and guidelines, and research. Its emergency relief activities include organizational support, the provision of emergency drugs and supplies, and conducting technical emergency assessment missions. WHO‚Äôs 
        <i>R&amp;D Blueprint</i>
         is a global preparedness plan focused on the swift activation of research and development activities during epidemics.
      </p>
               <p>Under the International Health Regulations, states parties are required to follow safeguarding procedures including reporting certain critical public health events to WHO, and WHO may declare as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) any extraordinary event that represents a public health risk to multiple countries, and which requires intensified mobilization of resources, and a co-ordinated global response, under the guidance of a dedicated International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of relevant experts. During the period 2009-March 2024 seven PHEICs were declared, in respect of outbreaks of H1N1 (swine flu) in 2009, wild poliovirus in 2014 (still in force in 2024), Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in 2014 and 2019, the Zika virus in 2016, novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) during the period 30 January 2020-5 May 2023, and mpox (initially referred to as Monkeypox, subsequently renamed) during 23 July 2022-12 May 2023.</p>
               <p usage="ewyb edio">In May 2018, during the 71st WHA, WHO and the World Bank Group jointly launched the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board (GPMB)‚Äî tasked with strengthening global health security through independent monitoring of preparedness to address outbreaks of disease, pandemics, and other serious health emergencies.</p>
               <p>WHO‚Äôs Global Alert and Response framework aims to provide an effective international system for co-ordinated response to epidemics and other public health emergencies. The Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), established in 2000 by WHO and several partner institutions in epidemic surveillance, maintains constant vigilance regarding outbreaks of disease, and links worldwide expertise to provide an immediate response capability. WHO assists member states in the development and implementation of domestic capacities for epidemic preparedness and response through strengthening national laboratory capacities and early warning alert and response mechanisms; supporting training programmes; and promoting standardized approaches in relation to biorisk reduction and epidemic-prone infections. In July 2011 WHO launched the Global Infection Prevention and Control (GIPC) Network, which provides technical support to member states, through the dissemination of epidemic-prone infection prevention and control (IPC) policies and guidance; the compilation of relevant indicators; and generic training curricula. In May 2023 the 76th WHA resolved to draft, during 2023-24, the inaugural Global Strategy on IPC.</p>
               <p usage="ewyb edio">WHO works to ensure that efficient planning and standards relating to disease surveillance, risk assessment and response are applied at established points of mass convergence of international travellers, for example airports and seaports, and also at mass international social gatherings, such as major sporting tournaments and religious pilgrimages.</p>
               <p>WHO aims to strengthen the national capacity of member states to reduce the adverse health consequences of disasters, including conflict, natural disasters and food insecurity. WHO has also taken into consideration the potential malevolent use of bacteria, viruses, toxins, or of chemical agents, in acts of biological or chemical terrorism. In responding to emergency situations, WHO works to develop projects and activities that will assist national authorities in rebuilding or strengthening their own capacity to handle the impact of such situations. In April 2015 WHO initiated a global registry of fast-response Emergency Medical Teams (EMTs). In October 2022 the 5th EMT Global Meeting, held in Yerevan, Armenia, launched an EMTs 2030 Strategy, focused on collectively addressing natural disasters and disease outbreaks.</p>
               <p>The sudden emergence and global severity of the COVID-19 crisis, from 2020, had a catalytic impact on the development of the global pandemic preparedness and response architecture. A WHO BioHub System for Preparedness and Response to Epidemics and Pandemics, announced in November 2020, aimed to enhance the rapid sharing of viruses and other pathogens between research laboratories worldwide. The first WHO BioHub Facility, based in Switzerland, was initiated in May 2021. A Berlin, Germany-based WHO Hub for Pandemic and Epidemic Intelligence, inaugurated in September, was to support national governments in monitoring emerging variants of concern of COVID-19 and in promptly detecting and responding to pandemic and epidemic risks. In October WHO established a Scientific Advisory Group for the Origins of Novel Pathogens (SAGO), tasked with investigating the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, and with assessing outbreaks of new diseases. A special session of the WHA held on 1 December agreed to establish an intergovernmental negotiating body to draft a new global framework instrument on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response (as recommended by an Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response‚Äîestablished by the WHA in May 2020 to conduct an independent and comprehensive evaluation of the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic). In March 2022 WHO initiated a Global Genomic Surveillance Strategy for Pathogens with Pandemic and Epidemic Potential, to cover the period 2022-32. In April 2023 WHO launched a new Preparedness and Resilience for Emerging Threats (PRET) initiative, which was to have an initial focus on coronaviruses, influenza, respiratory syncytial viruses, and other respiratory pathogens. WHO and partners launched an International Pathogen Surveillance Network (IPSN) in the following month.</p>

WHO experts were deployed immediately to address the emerging virus, and technical guidance was issued on relevant clinical management, case definitions, surveillance, infection prevention and control, and on reducing zoonotic transmission; advisory notices for international traffic were also released. On 30 January 2020 WHO formally declared the intensifying new coronavirus epidemic to be a PHEIC. (The new virus was officially termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2‚ÄîSARS-CoV-2‚Äîin February, and the disease that it was causing in humans named COVID-19.) At the beginning of February WHO launched a preparedness and response plan, with a focus on ending human-human and zoonotic transmission of the virus, protecting frontline health workers, strengthening the capacity of fragile health systems to detect and diagnose the virus and to support patients, and minimizing the social and economic impact of the crisis. A Global Research Roadmap was formulated to effect a co-ordinated scientific response to the epidemic. On 11 March WHO declared the outbreak to be a global pandemic, expressing deep concern at `the alarming levels of spread and severity‚Äô. In the following month WHO and partners initiated the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT)-Accelerator (q.v.), and in early June a US&#8201;$2,000m. procurement fund was announced to support poorer countries to access COVID-19 vaccines. In May 2021 WHO assigned a new naming system for public discourse of the identified variants of SARS-CoV-2 based on the Greek alphabet, rather than by the country or region where they were first detected. WHO‚Äôs Director-General participated from mid-2021 in a Multilateral Leaders Taskforce on vaccines access with the WTO Director-General, IMF Executive Director and World Bank President. In August WHO published guidelines on the technical requirements for the issuance of digital certificates demonstrating vaccination against COVID-19.

By the end of 2023 more than two-thirds of the eligible global population had completed a primary COVID-19 vaccination schedule, and around one-third had received at least one booster dose (i.e. reinforcing the completed primary schedule). According to the Global Dashboard for Vaccine Equity‚Äîan initiative of WHO, UNDP and the University of Oxford‚Äî32.8% of people in low-income countries globally had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine by 29 November, compared with 79.9% in high-income nations.</p>

          In March 2014 WHO issued an updated version of a 
          <i>Global Influenza Preparedness Plan</i>
           originally launched in 2005. In May 2011 the 64th WHA adopted a Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework, which aimed to broaden access to anti-influenza vaccines. In March 2019 WHO initiated a Global Influenza Strategy, covering the period 2019-30, with a focus on preventing seasonal influenza (believed to cause up to 650,000 deaths annually), controlling the spread of influenza from animals to humans, and pandemic preparedness. Updated WHO

                    <p usage="ewyb edio fea sasia">From the end of 2003 WHO monitored the spread through several Asian countries of the virus H5N1 (a rapidly mutating strain of zoonotic highly pathogenic avian influenza‚ÄîHPAI) that was transmitting to human populations through contact with diseased birds. In 2014 WHO reported that H5N1‚Äîwhich had become endemic among poultry in parts of Asia and Africa‚Äîdid not appear to transmit easily among people. In May 2005, in co-operation with FAO and WOAH, WHO launched a Global Strategy for the Progressive Control of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza. By 26 February 2024 a total of 887 human cases of H5N1 had been laboratory confirmed, in 23 countries, resulting in 462 deaths. Two further general sub-types of avian influenza‚ÄîH7 and H9‚Äîhave also been reported in humans. During early 2013-2 March 2024 1,568 cases of H7N9 in humans had been reported to WHO, resulting in at least 616 fatalities (with the last case having been recorded in 2019, in the Western Pacific region). In April 2009 WHO declared an epidemic of `swine flu‚Äô‚Äîa new form of H1N1 that had emerged in Mexico, apparently combining bird, swine and human forms of influenza‚Äîas the first ever PHEIC, and from June WHO designated the H1N1 crisis as a pandemic. By 2010, when the spread of H1N1 had been contained, as many as 200,000 swine flu human fatalities were reported to have occurred.</p>

                    <p usage="ewyb edio ass sasia">In October 1998 WHO, jointly with UNICEF, the World Bank and the UN Development Programme (UNDP), formally launched the Roll Back Malaria (RBM) programme. The global multi-stakeholder RBM Partnership aims to mobilize resources and support for controlling malaria. WHO recommends a number of guidelines for malaria control, focusing on the need for prompt, effective antimalarial treatment, and the issue of drug resistance; vector control, including the use of insecticide-treated bed nets; malaria in pregnancy; malaria epidemics; and monitoring and evaluation activities. WHO‚Äôs Global Technical Strategy for Malaria (GTS), covering the period 2016-30 (and updated in mid-2021) aims‚Äîthrough a continued focus on the promotion of universal access to malaria prevention, diagnosis and treatment; strengthening surveillance; and the achievement of national malaria-free status‚Äîto reduce malaria cases globally by 90% by 2030, as well as to eliminate the disease entirely in at least 35 countries by 2030. A complementary RBM advocacy plan: Action and Investment to defeat Malaria 2016-30 (AIM) was being implemented simultaneously. The GTS and AIM were aligned with the SDGs, including SDG 3, Target 3.3. A large-scale clinical trial of the first ever vaccine against malaria (known as RTS,S/AS01, or `Mosquirix‚Äô, and thought to cause a 30% reduction in deadly severe malaria) was initiated in April 2019 in Malawi, and then extended to Ghana and Kenya. In a landmark decision in October 2021 WHO recommended the widespread preventive use of RTS,S/AS01 among children in sub-Saharan Africa and in other regions with moderate to high malaria transmission (according to a schedule of four doses given from the age of five months). In December Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance approved US&#8201;$160m. in funding to assist the delivery of the vaccine throughout sub-Saharan Africa during 2022-25. In December 2022 WHO reported that more than 1.2m. children in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi had already received one or more RTS,S/AS01 doses. A second malaria vaccine, R21/Matrix-M, was approved by WHO in October 2023.</p>
                    <p usage="ewyb edio ass">In December 2023 WHO estimated that in 2022 there were 249m. cases of malaria, in 85 malaria-endemic countries, and 608,000 deaths from the disease. Around 94% of confirmed cases in 2022 occurred in WHO‚Äôs Africa region; 2% arose in WHO‚Äôs South East Asia region, where numbers fell from 23m. in 2000 to 5m. in 2022 (India accounted for 66% of the cases reported there in 2022). Some 96% of the caseload in 2022 occurred in 29 countries (with 27% of cases arising in Nigeria, and 12% in the Democratic Republic of the Congo‚ÄîDRC). It was reported that 260m. insecticide-treated mosquito nets were provided to malaria-endemic countries during 2022. Of 88 malaria-endemic countries that had supplied data for the period 2010-20 29 had detected resistance to all four of the most frequently used classes of insecticide, and 78 had detected resistance to at least one insecticide class. In November 2022 WHO launched a strategy to counter antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. Funding for research on malaria control and elimination amounted to US&#8201;$4,100m. in 2022.</p>

A second UN high-level meeting on TB was convened in September 2023 (the first having been held in 2018), at which a Global Action Pledge to End TB by 2030 was adopted, incorporating measures to achieve that target.</p>

Following a massive international campaign of vaccina¬≠tion and surveillance (begun in 1958 and intensified in 1967), the last case was detected in 1977 and the eradication of the disease was declared in 1980. In May 1996 the WHA resolved that, pending a final endorsement, all remaining stocks of the variola virus (which causes smallpox) were to be destroyed on 30 June 1999, although 500,000 doses of smallpox vaccine were to remain, along with a supply of the smallpox vaccine seed virus, in order to ensure that a further supply of the vaccine could be made available if required. In May 1999, however, the Assembly authorized a temporary retention of stocks of the virus until 2002. In late 2001, in response to fears that illegally held virus stocks could be used in acts of biological terrorism, WHO reassembled a team of technical experts on smallpox. In January 2002 the Executive Board determined that stocks of the virus should continue to be retained, to enable research into more effective treatments and vaccines. By 2024 no deadline had been nominated for the destruction of the remaining virus stocks.</p>

A GPEI Strategy, covering the period 2022-26, had the following strategic objectives: re-envisioning the GPEI‚Äôs relationship with governments and systematizing political advocacy; bringing about increased vaccine acceptance through community engagement; expediting progress through expanded partnerships; reforming campaign and outbreak response operations; and enhancing poliomyelitis (polio) surveillance, detection and response. The GPEI has been phasing down the traditional use of (highly effective) live bivalent oral polio vaccines (bOPVs), as they carry a small risk of passing on vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP). More costly (also very effective) inactivated poliovirus vaccines (IPVs) do not carry this risk. In October 2022 WHO organized a pledging summit that raised US&#8201;$2,600m. in support of the GPEI Strategy. During 2023 the GPEI and partners vaccinated more than 400m. children.</p>

WHO's Mental Health Programme is concerned with unipolar and bipolar affective disorders, psychosis, epilepsy, dementia, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, drug and alcohol dependency, and neuro¬≠psychiatric disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive compulsive disorder and panic disorder. WHO aims to increase awareness of mental health issues and promote improved mental health ser¬≠vices and primary care. In October 2008 WHO launched the mental health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP), which aimed to improve services addressing mental, neurological and substance use (MNS) disorders, with a special focus on low- and middle-income countries. In August 2013 WHO extended mhGAP to incorporate new clinical protocols and guidelines aimed at supporting health care workers in treating PTSD. The third edition of mhGAP guidelines on appropriate treatment and care of MNS disorders was published in November 2023. A WHO Mental Health Action Plan, covering the period 2013-30, has the objectives of strengthening effective mental health leadership and governance; providing comprehensive, integrated and responsive mental health and social care services in community-based settings; implementing strategies for mental health prevention and promotion; and strengthening information systems, evidence and research.

        , issued in October 2019, estimated that, globally, at least 2,200m. people had a partial or full vision impairment, and that at least 1,000m. of those impairments either could have been preventable or could be addressed. The report made several recommendations, including enhanced integration of eye care within national health services, and a focus on access to rehabilitation services for people with severe eye health conditions.

        In May 2020 the 73rd WHA adopted a resolution on integrated people-centred eye care (referred to as IPEC), aimed at ensuring the widespread use of IPEC. In May 2021 the 74th WHA resolved that by 2030 global coverage of surgery to address refractive errors and cataracts should increase by 40% and 30%, respectively. During the 75th WHA, in May 2022, a WHO

                    <p>In January 2018 WHO and UNEP signed an agreement establishing an extensive new programme of WHO-UN Environment collaboration, comprising joint actions aimed at combating environmental health risks, such as antimicrobial resistance, air pollution, and climate change. Furthermore, co-ordination was to be strengthened in the areas of waste and chemicals management, food and nutrition, and water quality. A joint work programme was to be developed, and the two agencies were to convene an annual high-level meeting, to follow up progress and make recommendations for advancing the collaboration. In May 2019 the WHA endorsed a Global Strategy on Health, Environment and Climate Change, which aimed to address environmental health risks and challenges until 2030. A Special Envoy for Climate Change and Health has been appointed.</p>
                    <p usage="edio">In July 2014 WHO, with the World Meteorological Office, established an office of climate and health to promote the development and use of climate services to enhance public health, such as through disease surveillance and emergency preparedness.</p>
                    <p>WHO's programme area on environmental health addresses the increasing threats to health and wellbeing from a changing environment, especially in relation to air pollution, water quality, sanitation, protection against UV-radiation, management of hazardous waste, chemical safety and housing hygiene. In October-November 2018 WHO, with UNEP and other partners, organized the inaugural Global Conference on Air Pollution and Health; this committed to a goal of reducing deaths from air pollution by two-thirds by 2030. In April 2022 WHO reported that 99% of the global population was breathing air that did not meet WHO‚Äôs air quality limits on fine particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide.</p>
                    <p>In 2022 WHO attributed some 829,000 deaths annually to diarrhoea caused by unsafe drinking water, sanitation systems and hand hygiene. Around 2,000m. people worldwide in 2020 were reported to have no access to clean drinking water. In August 2019 WHO released a report on microplastics in drinking water and urged further assessment of the risks posed to human health by microplastics in the environment.</p>

In October 2011 a global conference convened by WHO adopted the Rio Political Declaration on Social Determinants of Health, expressing commitment to reducing inequities in health and health care provision. In February 2020 WHO, with the Government of Sweden, organized, in the Swedish capital Stockholm, a Global Ministerial Conference on Road Safety, in order to address preventable road traffic deaths and injuries (totalling an estimated 1.3m. fatalities each year and a further 50m. injuries) in the context of the SDGs.

In collaboration with other international agencies, WHO is implementing a comprehensive strategy for promoting appropriate infant, young child and maternal nutrition, and for dealing effectively with nutritional emergencies in large populations. Priorities include promoting practices that enhance successful breastfeeding (recommended by WHO as the best means of feeding babies until at least six months of age); appropriate complementary feeding; refining the use and interpretation of body measurements for assessing nutritional status; relevant information, education and training; and action to give effect to the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes.</p>

The programme provides expert advice on such issues as foodborne diseases and pathogens (e.g. bovine spongiform encephalopathy, campylobacter, escherichia coli, listeria, and salmonella), production methods (e.g. aquaculture) and food biotechnology (e.g. genetic modification). WHO also addresses the methods of producing, processing and preparing foods that contribute to the incidence (especially in parts of East and South-East Asia and Latin America) of foodborne trematode infections (parasitic infections caused by flatworms). WHO‚Äôs Global Foodborne Infections Network, established in 2001, promotes integrated laboratory-based surveillance and intersectoral collaboration among human health, veterinary and food-related entities.

In March 2002 an intergovernmental task force established by the Commission finalized `principles for the risk analysis of foods derived from biotechnology', which were to provide a framework for assessing the safety of GM foods and plants. A Codex Trust Fund, initiated in 2003, assists the efficient participation of developing countries in the work of the Commission.

               <p usage="ewyb edio">In September 2016 the UN General Assembly issued a Political Declaration on tackling antimicrobial resistance (AMR): the spread of infections caused by micro-organisms (bacteria, viruses, parasites and fungi) that evolve to become `super-pathogens‚Äô, resistant to conventional treatments. First-line medicines are increasingly failing, with second- and third-line agents proving generally significantly more costly. A Global Action Plan on AMR, endorsed by the WHA in May 2015, aimed to address contributory factors such as over-prescribing, the use of antimicrobials in livestock reared for human consumption, and weak national drug policies and regulation in many countries (enabling, for example, the open-market purchase of non-prescribed antimicrobial medicines). In October WHO established the Global Antimicrobial Surveillance System (GLASS) to work in collaboration with WHO centres and existing surveillance mechanisms. In December 2022 WHO reported that 127 states or territories were participating in the initiative.</p>
               <p>
        A UN Interagency Coordination Group on Antimicrobial Resistance was established in March 2017, under the joint chairmanship of the WHO Director-General and the UN Deputy Secretary-General. In June 2019 WHO, FAO and the World Organisation for Animal Health collectively established an AMR Multi Partner Trust Fund, with initial funding of US&#8201;$5m. In June 2023 WHO published its first global research agenda on AMR in human health, which outlined 40 research topics relating to drug-resistant bacteria, fungi and TB. In February 2024 an updated
