          <p>WIPO provides a global forum for IP-related policy, services, technical support and co-operation, for governments, intergovernmental organizations, civil society and industry bodies. It works to construct a global technical IP infrastructure, to foster respect for IP, and to resolve IP and domain name disputes. Member states are encouraged to sign and enforce international treaties relating to the protection of IP, with a view to ensuring that the owner of a copyright, patent, trademark or industrial design benefits from their work and that their rights are safeguarded. Within the various systems managed by WIPO a single centralized application provides international protection. WIPO maintains online portals (for example, eMadrid, eHague and ePCT) to simplify applications under the treaties that it administers. Through this system, and by making IP data readily accessible, WIPO aims to promote international trade, and to facilitate the advancement of science, technology and the arts.</p>
          <p>WIPO’s strategic plan for 2022-26, published in June 2021, was focused on the following strategic pillars: (i) reach out worldwide to explain the potential for IP to improve the lives of everyone, everywhere; (ii) bring people together and partner with stakeholders to shape the future of the global IP ecosystem; (iii) provide high quality IP services, knowledge and data that deliver value to users around the world; and (iv) support governments, enterprises, communities and individuals to use IP as a tool for growth and sustainable development.</p>
          <p>WIPO organizes an annual observation on 26 April, World IP Day (themed in 2024: `IP and the Sustainable Development Goals: Building our common future with innovation and creativity’).</p>

        , with a focus on expanding the worldwide availability of books in braille, large print and audio formats. The public-private partnership WIPO for Creators aims to raise awareness of creators’ rights. In November 2023 WIPO launched an online initiative CLIP—Creators Learn Intellectual Property, aimed at educating music industry creators on their IP rights.

        The 2022 edition of WIPO’s biennial flagship 
        <publ-name>World Intellectual Property Report,</publ-name>
         released in April, was themed `The Direction of Innovation’. It noted that the number of patents related to digital innovation had quadrupled during the period 2000-20, and that by 2020 innovators based in Japan held one-quarter of global patents relating to information and communications technology (ICT), followed by the Republic of Korea (South Korea) (18%) and the People’s Republic of China (14%). The number of patents relating to innovation in low-carbon emission technologies was reported to have increased by 6% annually during 1973-2012, but subsequently to have stagnated. The recent rapid development of patents related to mRNA vaccines and anti-viral therapies was observed.

          Alternative dispute resolution (ADR) between private parties is facilitated by the WIPO AMC, which was established in 1994. The AMC deliberates on ADR requests, relating to agreements on, 
          <i>inter alia</i>
          , licensing (for example in respect of patents, copyright, software and trademarks), TT, research and development, franchising, joint ventures, consultancy, data processing, digital copyright, art marketing and distribution. The Center also provides `good offices’ to pursue the direct resolution of disputes between conflicting parties. (These may be followed by formal ADR proceedings.) In 2023 a record 679 disputes were submitted to the AMC (compared with 548 in 2022, 263 in 2021, and 36 in 2013). By the end of 2023 50% of the total cases in addressed by the Center since its establishment related to disputed copyright and digital content. The AMC’s Domain Name Dispute Resolution service plays a leading role in resolving conflicts over cybersquatting, i.e. the abusive registration of another's trademark in an internet domain name. The service is provided in accordance with the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP) that was, on WIPO's recommendation, adopted by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers—ICANN in October 1999. Cumulatively, by 2024 more than 67,000 UDRP cases, relating to some 120,000 separate domain names, had been filed by WIPO under UDRP procedures. A record 6,192 such cases were submitted during 2023. WIPO publishes an online Legal Index of WIPO UDRP Panel Decisions and maintains an online database of cybersquatting cases. The Center also organizes workshops and assists in the development of WIPO model contract clauses and industry-specific resolution schemes.

                    <p>The WIPO Judicial Institute, established in 2018, aims to support the administration of IP, in alignment with member states’ national legal traditions. WIPO Lex offers an extensive, free search facility for IP national laws and treaties. In September 2020 WIPO launched WIPO Lex-Judgments, a global database of IP-related judicial decisions. The sixth annual WIPO IP Judges Forum was convened in November 2023, in Geneva and online.</p>

        WIPO maintains a series of public databases, and has increasingly incorporated artificial intelligence (AI)-based technology into search functions. An online International Patent Classification-Computer-Assisted Categorization (IPC-CAT) tool uses automatic text categorization technology to classify abstracts of inventions submitted by users. For trademarks there is a counterpart online Vienna Classification Assistant, facilitated by image-search technology. WIPO’s key global databases—PATENTSCOPE, Global Brand, and Global Design—included 114m., 64m. and nearly 16m. data records, respectively, at January 2024. WIPO Translate, an AI-based tool for translating highly technical patent documents held in PATENTSCOPE, was launched in May 2018, and by 2024 covered 13 languages. An image-search function was added to Global Brand databases in 2014 to enable users to upload to the system specific images and then to search for visually similar trademarks and logos. WIPO also maintains Madrid Monitor, Hague Express and Lisbon Express databases, and, in connection with the 
        <xr pageref="N" ref="WIPO.IO.PARIS.1">Paris Convention</xr>
        , an Article 6ter database, that protects state emblems (such as armorial bearings and flags). WIPO Pearl, initiated in September 2014, is a multilingual online database of scientific and technical terms and concepts that are used in patents, and includes a COVID-19 Glossary. It aims to ensure global consistency in relevant key IP terminology across 10 languages. WIPO Speech to Text, which uses AI swiftly to transcribe audio and video material, in the UN’s six official languages, is used at international conferences. A Patent Information Initiative for Medicines (Pat-INFORMED) database, co-launched by WIPO in September 2018, supports the informed procurement of medicines. An online WIPO Knowledge Center provides access to IP research materials and organizes webinars on IP. A WIPO IP Policy Toolkit has been devised to support academic and research institutions.

        WIPO administers and periodically reviews international classifications established by treaties and relating to inventions, marks and industrial designs. It also carries out studies on issues in the field of IP that could be the subject of model laws or guidelines for implementation at national or international level. WIPO’s annual 
        <publ-name>World Intellectual Property Indicators</publ-name>

The services provided by WIPO under its so-called Global Protection System treaties simplify the registration process and reduce the cost of making individual applications or filings in each country in which protection for a given IP right is sought. </p>
