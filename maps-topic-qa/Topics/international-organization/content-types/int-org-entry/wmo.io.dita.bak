          <p>In June 2023 the 19th World Meteorological Congress approved a strategic plan to guide WMO’s activities during the period 2024-27. The plan’s overall objective was to ensure, by end-2027, that everyone on Earth is protected against hazardous weather by life-saving early warning systems. It had the following overarching priorities: (i) Enhancing preparedness and reducing loss of life, critical infrastructure and livelihood from hydrometeorological extremes; (ii) Supporting climate-smart decision-making to build or enhance adaptive capacity or resilience to climate risk; and (iii) Enhancing socioeconomic value of weather, climate, hydrological and related environmental services. The longer-term goals to be achieved by 2030 focused on better serving societal needs through the delivery of appropriate accessible information and services; enhancing Earth system observations and predictions; strengthening the technical foundation for future activities; advancing targeted research; closing the capacity gap on weather, climate, hydrological and related environmental services; and implementing a realignment of WMO structure and programmes to enhance policy making and the making and implementation of decisions.</p>
          <p usage="edio">The 19th World Meteorological Congress also approved a resolution focused on the goal of achieving gender equality through the provision of gender-sensitive weather, hydrological and climate services that respond to the specific needs and socioeconomic circumstances of both women and men; furthermore, the Congress confirmed that, as a minimum target, women should fill at least 40% of roles in the working structures of related regional associations, technical commissions and of the WMO Research Board.</p>

          , to determine to what extent climate can be predicted, and the extent of man's influence on climate. The WCRP Strategic Plan 2019-28 had the following priority objectives: (i) advancing the fundamental understanding of processes, variations and changes in the climate system; (ii) predicting the near-term evolution of the climate system; (iii) refining the ability to anticipate future pathways of climate system change; and (iv) promoting the development of theory and practice in the integration between natural and social sciences. The following four WCRP core projects were being implemented during 2019-28: Climate and Cryosphere (CliC); Climate and Ocean—Variability, Predictability and Change (CLIVAR); Global Energy and Water Exchanges (GEWEX); and Stratosphere-troposphere Processes And their Role in Climate (SPARC). It was announced in December 2020 that the functioning of the Programme was to be streamlined to support the implementation of the ongoing Strategic Plan. In that month the WCRP and Future Earth—a global network of scientists, innovators and researchers—signed an agreement on future co-operation. In June 2015 the 17th Congress inaugurated WCRP Grand Science Challenges, to comprise projects with a focus on high-priority research, that require support from international partnerships. In 2023 Challenges were implemented with a focus on melting ice and global consequences, clouds, circulation and climate sensitivity, carbon feedbacks in the climate system, weather and climate extremes, water for the food baskets of the world, regional sea level change and coastal impacts, and near-term climate prediction. WCRP’s Open Science Conference was held in Kigali, Rwanda, and in a virtual format, in October 2023.

                    <p>GAW integrates monitoring and research activities involving the long-term measurement of atmospheric composition, and is intended to serve as an early warning system to detect further changes under the following principal focal areas: total atmospheric composition; greenhouse gases; ozone; aerosol; selected reactive gases; and ultraviolet (UV) radiation. GAW is the main contributor of data on chemical composition and surface UV radiation to the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). GAW comprises a network of 30 global stations in remote areas of the world and around 400 regional stations. Regular shipborne research programmes and a network of contributing stations support GAW’s surface observation activities. These are complemented by space-based satellite and airborne observations of the lower stratosphere and upper troposphere, which assess levels of solar radiation, ozone, the atmospheric burden of aerosols, and various trace gases. GAW oversees the WMO Sand and Dust Storm Warning Advisory and Assessment System (SDS-WAS), and works with the advisory Joint Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Environmental Protection (GESAMP).</p>
                    <p>
          Since 2006 GAW has prepared an annual 
          <publ-name>Greenhouse Gas Bulletin</publ-name>
           to report on the main emitted gases on the atmosphere, including long-lived greenhouse gases (LLGHGs), and to provide scientific evidence for policy and decision making. Quality Assurance/Science Activity Centres have been established to ensure an overall level of quality in GAW. Atmospheric composition information is maintained by a series of seven GAW World Data Centres: the World Data Center for Remote Sensing of the Atmosphere (in Wessling, Germany), and further centres covering ozone and UV; solar radiation; greenhouse gases; reactive gases; aerosols; and precipitation chemistry. GAW’s Urban Environment Meteorological Research Programme (GURME) assists NMHSs in dealing with regional and urban pollution monitoring and forecasting, through the provision of guidelines and information on the requisite measuring and modelling infrastructures, and by bringing together NMHSs, regional and city administrations and health authorities.

                    <p>WMO considers the polar regions (including the `Third Pole’—the Himalayan and Tibetan Plateau) as extremely important in terms of their impact on global weather, water and climate. The 16th World Meteorological Congress (2011) supported the need to establish an observational framework for polar regions, including an Antarctic Observing Network; determined to support a Global Integrated Polar Prediction System; and decided to develop, with international partners, the GCW. The Congress emphasized the significance, in terms of climate change prediction, of the cryosphere—i.e. water in its frozen state, including snow cover, sea, lake and river ice, glaciers, ice caps, ice sheets and permafrost, spanning all latitudes, in approximately 100 countries. WMO established a Polar Space Task Group and subsidiary Synthetic Aperture Radar Coordination Working Group in 2011; these were tasked with improving the co-ordination of the collection of satellite radar data in the polar regions and cryosphere. In 2015 the 17th World Meteorological Congress decided that the GCW should be implemented henceforth as a cross-cutting activity. The GCW’s Snow Watch Team conducts assessments of snow and solid precipitation.</p>

                    <p>The WHOS provides a framework for the reliable exchange of hydrological data. A WMO HydroHub—to provide a sustainable and efficient source of hydrological data and information—was established in 2016. A World Hydrological Cycle Observing System focuses on strengthening the technical and human capabilities of NMHSs in the areas of information production, collection and dissemination. A Water and Climate Leaders Panel met for the first time in March 2021, under WMO auspices, with the aim of developing integrated action on water and climate in support of the implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The Extraordinary WMO Congress that was convened in October adopted a Vision and Strategy for Hydrology and associated plan of action, which set the following long-term goals: (i) No one is surprised by a flood; (ii) Everyone is prepared for drought; (iii) Hydro-climate and meteorological data support the food security agenda; (iv) High-quality data supports science; (v) Science provides a sound basis for operational hydrology; (vi) We have a thorough knowledge of the water resources of our world; (vii) Sustainable development is supported by hydrological information; and (viii) Water quality is known. During November 2022 a WMO-supported inter-agency Action for Water Adaptation and Resilience (AWARe) initiative was launched. In June 2023 a dedicated Hydrological Assembly was convened during the 19th World Meteorological Congress. The 19th Congress determined to enhance implementation of the ongoing plan of action for the implementation of the Vision and Strategy for Hydrology.</p>

The core infrastructure of the WIS comprises Global Information System Centres (GISCs), of which there were 15 in 2023, as well as data collection or production centres, and national centres. A WIS 2.0 phase, introduced in December 2022, supports a new Global Basic Observing Network and WMO Unified Data policy. (Both were approved in October 2021, and aim to enhance real-time international, regional and national data sharing.) Eventually the WIS was to supersede the Global Telecommunication System (q.v.). An open-source WIS2 in a box software supports LDCs and SIDs with the implementation of WIS 2.0.</p>

               <p>Through its scientific and technical programmes and network of meteorological and climate centres, WMO provides observational, monitoring, prediction and early warning services in respect of a wide range of weather-, climate- and water-related hazards. In March 2015, at the third UN World Conference on DDR, which adopted the Sendai Framework for DDR (2015-30), WMO confirmed that it would provide support to member states in establishing Multi-Hazard Early Warning Systems (MHEWS). DRR activities relevant to the Sendai Framework are integrated across WMO’s programming. In June 2019 the 18th World Meteorological Congress endorsed a series of measures aimed at strengthening MHEWS and at including these in humanitarian operations. The Congress determined to promote the implementation of a new Global Multi-hazard Alert System that was under development by a WMO expert group at that time. The Congress noted the special need to enhance early warning services in urban areas, owing to their vulnerability to multiple hazards, such as poor air quality, heatwaves and flooding. Global co-operation in combating sand and dust storms was to be enhanced.</p>

          WMO and the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction co-lead the inter-agency Early Warnings for All initiative that was launched in November 2022 by the UN Secretary-General, and aimed to put in place a worldwide early warning system by the end of 2027. The initiative aims to strengthen the four pillars that underpin (MHEWS): Disaster risk knowledge; Detection, observation, monitoring, analysis, and forecasting; Warning dissemination and communication; and Preparedness and response capabilities. Achieving Early Warnings for All requires broad partnerships at the global, regional, and national levels in support of the most vulnerable and at risk. WMO maintains an online Early Warnings for All Dashboard, and issues an annual

           report. In May 2022 WMO helped to organize the third MHEWS Conference, in Bali, Indonesia. With the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) WMO has established procedures and response mechanisms for the provision and exchange of observational data and specialized transport model products in the event of a nuclear accident. In the framework of WMO’s Emergency Response Activities Programme, 10 regional specialized meteorological centres are on continuous stand by to provide a nuclear environmental emergency response.

Global average near-surface temperature were reported as having reached 1.45°C higher than pre-industrial levels, while carbon dioxide levels in the global atmosphere were 50% higher, causing heat to be trapped. Global mean sea level rises in 2023 reached a record high since relevant satellite records began in 1993, and more than 90% of the world’s ocean experienced heatwave conditions at some point during the year. Preliminary data indicated that WMO’s global set of reference glaciers had suffered the largest loss of ice since 1950 (when relevant records began), with Antarctic sea ice extent reported to be by far the lowest on record. The past decade had also been the warmest ten-year period on record.
