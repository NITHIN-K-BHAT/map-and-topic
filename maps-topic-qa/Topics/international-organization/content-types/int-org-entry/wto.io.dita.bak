          <p id="WTO.IO.CASEE.4">The WTO was established on 1 January 1995, as the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), overseeing the multilateral trading system. The WTO facilitates negotiations on global trade agreements, monitors the implementation of trade agreements, undertakes dispute procedures, and works to build the trade capacity of developing states. It participates in the UN Chief Executives Board for Co-ordination as a related organization.</p>

               <p>The WTO has 164 members, including the European Union (EU), representing 98% of the volume of world trade. On 26 February 2024 Protocols of Accession were signed for Comoros and Timor-Leste; these were submitted to their respective legislatures for ratification. There are 25 observer governments. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank have observer status in all WTO bodies, while other UN agencies, and other international organizations—including the European Free Trade Association, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Customs Organization and the Organisation of African, Caribbean and Pacific States—have observer status on selected bodies.</p>

          <p>The Final Act of the Uruguay Round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) multilateral trade negotiations, concluded in December 1993, provided for extensive trade liberalization measures and for the establishment of a permanent structure to oversee international trading procedures. The Final Act was signed in April 1994, in Marrakesh, Morocco. At the same time a separate accord, the Marrakesh Declaration, was signed endorsing the establishment of the WTO. The essential functions of the WTO are to administer and facilitate the implementation of the results of the Uruguay Round; to provide a forum for multilateral trade negotiations; to administer the trade dispute settlement procedures; to review national trade policies; and to co-operate with other international institutions, in particular the IMF and the World Bank, in order to achieve greater coherence in global economic policymaking.</p>
          <p>The WTO Agreement contains 29 individual legal texts and more than 25 additional ministerial declarations, decisions and understandings, which cover obligations and commitments for member states, and are based on a number of core principles. An integral part of the Agreement is `GATT 1994', an amended and updated version of the original GATT Agreement of 1947, which was formally concluded at the end of 1995.</p>
          <p>The WTO organizes an annual public forum, with participation by representatives of civil society, business, governments, parliaments, international agencies, the media and academia; the 2024 event was to be held in September. A WTO Trade Dialogues framework was inaugurated in 2016, comprising a series of meetings of worldwide stakeholders.</p>

               <p usage="edio">At the end of March 2020 the WTO launched an internet portal on COVID-19 and trade. In April, the WTO and the World Customs Organization determined to collaborate to facilitate trade in medical items, food and other essential supplies</p>
               <p>The WTO estimated a significant decline of 9.2% in the volume of global merchandise trade across 2020 (given the impacts of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic), followed by a rebound of 10.8% in 2021, and more modest growth of 2.7% in 2022 (attributed in part to impacts of the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine—both countries being key suppliers to the global markets of food, fertilizers and energy). In February 2023 the WTO’s Director-General and the heads of the World Bank Group, WFP, IMF and FAO issued a joint statement in which they called for further urgent collective actions (i) to rescue hunger hotspots through supporting country-level efforts to strengthen crisis preparedness, share information, and address local needs; (ii) to facilitate trade (including supporting measures aimed at increasing the availability of food and fertilizers and strengthening the provision of public goods), to improve the functioning of markets, and to strengthen the role of the private sector; and (iii) to reform harmful subsidies and repurpose them towards initiatives promoting global food security and sustainable food systems.</p>
               <p>
        The volume of global merchandise trade was reported to have declined by 0.4% in the third quarter of 2023, over the previous quarter, and by 2.5% in comparison with the equivalent quarter of 2022. In March 2024 the 
        <publ-name>WTO Goods Trade Barometer</publ-name>
         reported a slight upturn in the first quarter of that year, standing at 100.6—just above its baseline value of 100.0. The performance of trade in automotive products was measured at 110.8 (significantly above the baseline). However, underperformance was reported on the indices for raw materials (99.0), air freight (93.5), container shipping (89.4) and electronic components (85.2). Ongoing geopolitical tensions were deemed to pose a continuing near term risk to global trade.

               <heading>Doha Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations</heading>
               <p usage="edio casee">Formal negotiations on the agenda of a new multilateral trade `round' commenced in September 1998. While it was confirmed that further liberalization of agriculture and services was to be considered, no consensus was reached on the terms of reference or procedures for these negotiations. In addition, developing countries criticized renewed efforts to link trade and labour standards and to incorporate environmental considerations into the discussions. Efforts by the EU to broaden the talks to include investment and competition policy were resisted by the USA. The third Ministerial Conference, held in Seattle, Washington, USA, in November 1999, was severely disrupted by public demonstrations by a diverse range of interest groups concerned with the impact of WTO accords on the environment, workers' rights and developing countries. The differences between member states with regard to a formal agenda failed to be resolved during extensive negotiations, and the Conference was suspended. In February 2000 the General Council agreed to resume talks with regard to agriculture and services, and to consider difficulties in implementing the Uruguay Accord, which was a main concern of developing member states. In May the Council approved more flexible provisions for implementation of TRIPS (q.v.), as part of ongoing efforts to address the needs of developing member states and strengthen their confidence in the multilateral trading system.</p>
               <p>In November 2001 the fourth Ministerial Conference, held in Doha, Qatar, adopted a final declaration providing a mandate for an agenda for negotiations on a range of subjects. Most of the negotiations were initially scheduled to be concluded, on 1 January 2005, as a single undertaking, i.e. requiring universal agreement on all matters under consideration. A Trade Negotiations Committee (TNC) was established to supervise the process, referred to as the Doha Round. Several aspects of existing agreements were to be negotiated, while new issues to be addressed included WTO rules, such as subsidies, regional trade agreements and anti-dumping measures, and market access. The declaration incorporated a commitment to negotiate issues relating to trade and the environment, including fisheries subsidies, environmental labelling requirements, and the relationship between trade obligations of multilateral environment agreements and WTO rules. A Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund was established in late 2001, with a core budget of 15m. Swiss francs, to help to finance technical support for trade liberalization in less developed member states.</p>
               <p>The fifth Ministerial Conference, convened in Cancún, Mexico, in September 2003, failed to achieve consensus on a number of issues, in particular investment and competition policy. In August 2004, following intensive negotiations, the General Council endorsed a new Doha Agenda Work Programme (the so-called July Package of framework trade agreements) aimed at reviving the stalled process. Under the July Package all countries were to be required to reduce tariffs on agricultural imports, but the poorest countries would be set lower reduction targets and longer periods for their implementation. The EU’s subsidies to its milk and sugar producers and the USA’s subsidies to its cotton farmers were withdrawn from the Package and were to be addressed by separate negotiations.</p>
               <p>During July 2006-February 2007 negotiations were suspended across all sectors and all related deadlines postponed, owing to failure by the participating countries to reach a satisfactory final agreement on agricultural trade. Discussions held in June between the EU, the USA, India and Brazil failed to reach any agreement on the main areas of dispute, i.e. farm subsidies and market access. In July 2008 a meeting of the TNC failed to reach agreement on the formal establishment of modalities in agriculture and non-agricultural market access. The eighth Ministerial Conference, held in Geneva in December 2011, acknowledged that, despite strong engagement to conclude the Doha Round, the negotiations remained at an impasse. In December 2012 the Director-General expressed support for the World Trade Agenda initiative, which was launched in 2011 by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) with a view to re-animating the Doha negotiations.</p>
               <p>In December 2013 intensive consultations during the ninth Ministerial Conference, convened in Bali, Indonesia, secured the adoption of a Bali Package of measures to advance the Doha Round. The Package included a Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) to stimulate global trade through improved customs technology, training and procedures. The Bali Package also included an interim agreement for developing countries to implement food security programmes without being liable to trade disputes, an agreement on tariff quota administration and a political statement to improve market access for cotton producers in LDCs. In November 2014 a WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement Facility became operational, to support LDCs and developing countries in pursuing the reforms required under the TFA. A Protocol of Amendment was adopted by the General Council in November 2014, enabling the TFA to be inserted into the WTO Agreement. The General Council also reached agreement on the terms of a public stockholding proposal to enhance food security in developing member countries. The TFA entered into force on 22 February 2017, having received ratifications by two-thirds of WTO membership; by January 2024 it had been ratified by 156 member states.</p>
               <p>
        In December 2015 member states participating in the 10th ministerial meeting adopted the `Nairobi Package’ (see 
        <i>Agriculture</i>
        ) of six ministerial decisions focused on agriculture, cotton and the integration of LDCs into the global economy (including preferential access for LDC service providers).
      </p>
               <p>In June 2022 the 12th WTO Ministerial Conference agreed a Geneva Package of measures, that included: a decision relating to e-commerce; a Fisheries Subsidies Agreement (which required formal acceptance by two-thirds of the organization’s membership to enter into effect); and ministerial declarations on the WTO Response to the COVID-19 pandemic and preparedness for future pandemics, the Agreement on Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (q.v.), the emergency response to food insecurity, and WFP purchase exemptions from export restrictions.</p>
               <p>
        MC13, convened in late February-early March 2024, adopted the Abu Dhabi Ministerial Declaration, in which member states committed to reinforcing the multilateral trading system and emphasized the importance of services to the global economy, given that they generate more than two-thirds of worldwide economic output and provide more than one-half of jobs. New disciplines on the domestic regulation of services were effected, that were expected significantly to lower trade costs globally. An Investment Facilitation for Development (IFD) Agreement was finalized, that aimed to improve the global investment and business environment. Commitments were made to, 
        <i>inter alia</i>
        , advancing socioeconomic inclusion and sustainable development. By the end of MC13 71 member states had formally accepted the (2022) Fisheries Subsidies Agreement; it was hoped that its entry into force would be effected by the next Ministerial Conference. A Ministerial Declaration was adopted on strengthening regulatory co-operation with the aim of reducing technical barriers to trade. Agreement was also reached on maintaining the existing moratorium on the imposition of tariffs on digital goods and services.

               <heading>Tariffs</heading>
               <p>
        Tariffs most commonly represent a percentage of the value of a product (described as `ad valorem duties’), and are calculated using the customs value of imported goods. They may also be expressed as a `specific duty’ (e.g. as a set amount per kg). Both types are occasionally combined, in compound or mixed duties. Classification is based on the Harmonized System (HS, an international convention), which is administered by the World Customs Organization. Nearly all countries impose tariffs on imports, and some also levy duties on certain exports. Under the `Most Favoured Nation' (MFN) clause, WTO members are bound to grant to each other's products treatment no less favourable than that accorded to the products of any third parties. A number of exceptions apply, principally for customs unions and free trade areas and for measures in favour of and among developing countries. The principle of `national treatment' requires goods, having entered a market, to be treated no less favourably than the equivalent domestically produced goods. Furthermore, in accordance with GATT 1994 (Article II), WTO members may set the maximum tariff level they can levy on imports from other WTO members. So-called `bound duties’—contained in a member state’s `Schedules of concessions’, also known as their `Goods Schedule’ (representing legal instruments forming an integral part of the WTO Agreement)—are negotiated through the WTO and are promised as a commitment to all trading partners that are also WTO member states, to facilitate secure and predictable market access, and to encourage trade, investment and job creation. A member state cannot increase bound duties without compensation negotiations with main trading partners. In effect many member states, however, apply `MFN applied duties’, i.e. tariff levels that are significantly lower than the promised level. A WTO member may also apply `preferential duties’: tariffs that are lower still, on products originating under certain conditions in certain countries. Other WTO agreements also contribute to predictable trading conditions by demanding commitments from member countries and greater transparency of domestic laws and national trade policies. By permitting tariffs, while adhering to the guidelines of being non-discriminatory, the WTO aims to promote open, fair and undistorted competition. The WTO, the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the International Trade Centre jointly issue 
        <publ-name>World Tariff Profiles</publ-name>
        , which summarizes the tariff and non-tariff measures imposed by member states, while the WTO maintains the Tariff Analysis Online database, providing detailed information on national bound and applied tariffs, and import data. A Tariff Download Facility allows users to download aggregated information on MFN applied and bound tariffs for all WTO member states.

        The WTO aims to encourage development and economic reform among developing countries and countries with economies in transition participating in the international trading system. These states, particularly the LDCs (numbering 46 in 2024, of which 36 were WTO member states), have been granted transition periods and greater flexibility to implement certain WTO provisions. Member countries are encouraged to assist developing nations through their trading condi­tions and by not expecting reciprocity in trade concession negotiations. The 2005 Ministerial Conference launched the Aid for Trade initiative, for developing countries to build the supply capacity and trade-related infrastructure necessary for implementing and benefiting from WTO agreements. The WTO reported that 2012 was the first year in which the GDP of developing economies surpassed that of developed economies, and that—aided by the evolution of supply chains and the possibility of adding value to products at localized stages of production—trade between developing countries was expanding. In June 2013 an updated work programme was approved for member LDCs, which aimed to mainstream into WTO’s mandate the Istanbul Programme of Action for LDCs that was adopted, in May 2011, by the fourth UN Conference on the LDCs. The programme addressed, 
        <i>inter alia</i>
        , capacity-building initiatives, trade-related technical assistance, market access and the diversification of LDCs’ exports. In December 2017 a Trade for Peace initiative and G7+ Accessions Group was established, with the aim of supporting fragile and post-conflict economies. A Trade for Peace Network was launched in March 2021, to facilitate exchange of information by experts and policymakers on linkages between the multilateral trading system, peace and security. An Aid for Trade Stocktaking Event held in the same month aimed to assess the specific needs of developing countries and LDCs during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis and to mobilize financing towards a sustained recovery. In June 2022 Ministerial Conference adopted an agreement on a work programme for small economies. The eighth global review of the Aid for Trade initiative was held in late July. Aid for Trade’s work programme during 2023-24 was based on the theme `Partnerships for Food Security, Digital Connectivity and Mainstreaming Trade’. In early 2024 the 13th Ministerial Conference adopted a Ministerial Decision focused on empowering developing countries, and in particular LDCs, to fulfil their WTO commitments and better integrate into global trade, and agreed on concrete measures aimed at facilitating graduation from LDC status. It also determined to strengthen the work programme on small economies.

               <heading>Legal Framework</heading>
               <p id="WTO.CASEE.226">The WTO aims to provide a comprehensive legal framework for the international trading system. Under GATT 1994 `anti-dumping' measures were permitted against imports of a product with an export price below its normal value, if these imports were likely to cause damage to a domestic industry. The WTO agreement provides for greater clarity and more detailed rules determining the application of these measures and determines settlement procedures in disputes relating to anti-dumping actions taken by WTO members. In general, anti-dumping measures were to be limited to five years. The WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures is intended to expand on existing GATT agreements. It classifies subsidies into three categories: prohibited, which may be determined by the Dispute Settlement Body and must be immediately withdrawn; actionable, which must be withdrawn or altered if the subsidy is found to cause adverse effects on the interests of other members; and non-actionable, for example subsidies involving assistance to industrial research, assistance to disadvantaged regions or adaptation of facilities to meet new environmental requirements; non-actionable subsidies, however, were terminated in 1999. The Agreement also contains provisions on the use of duties to offset the effect of a subsidy (so-called countervailing measures) and establishes pro­cedures for the initiation and conduct of investigations into this action. Countervailing measures must generally be terminated within five years of their imposition. </p>
               <p id="WTO.CASEE.227">WTO members may take safeguard actions to protect a specific domestic industry from a damaging increase of imported products. However, the WTO agreement aims to clarify criteria for imposing safeguards, their duration (normally to be no longer than four years, which may be extended to eight years) and consultations on trade compensation for the exporting countries. Safeguard measures are not applicable to products from developing countries as long as their share of imports of the product concerned does not exceed 3%.</p>
               <p id="WTO.CASEE.228">Further legal arrangements act to ensure the following: that technical regulations and standards (including testing and certification procedures) do not create unnecessary obstacles to trade; that import licensing procedures are transparent and predictable; that the valuation of goods for customs purposes are fair and uniform; that GATT principles and obligations apply to import preshipment inspection activities; the fair and transparent administration of rules of origin; and that no investment measures which may restrict or distort trade may be applied.</p>

               <p id="WTO.CASEE.229">The majority of GATT agreements became multilateral obligations when the WTO became operational in 1995; however, four agreements, which had a selective group of signatories, remained in effect. These so-called plurilateral agreements, the Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft, the Agreement on Government Procure­ment, the International Dairy Agreement and the International Bovine Meat Agreement, aimed to increase international co-operation and fair and open trade and competition in these areas. The bovine meat and dairy agreements were terminated in 1997. The remaining two plurilateral agreements established their own management bodies, which are required to report to the General Council.</p>

               <p id="WTO.CASEE.230">The WTO’s Trade Policy Review Mechanism undertakes regular monitoring and surveillance of national trade policies, and aims to support assessment of the effects of policies on the world trading system. In addition, it records efforts made by governments to bring domestic trade legislation into conformity with WTO provisions and to implement WTO commitments. Reviews are conducted in the Trade Policy Review Body on the basis of a policy statement of the government under review and an independ­ent report prepared by the WTO Secretariat. The WTO barometers of trade in goods and services aim to provide regular, real-time indications of trade flows and trajectories.</p>

        A Work Programme on E-Commerce, active since 1998, co-ordinates consideration of e-commerce by WTO bodies and organizes regular discussions on the issue. In May 2020 the WTO Secretariat noted that the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic had led to a sharp increase in business-to-business e-commerce, business-to-consumers online sales (in particular for household essentials, food products and medical supplies), social media, video and film streaming, internet telephony, and teleconferencing. In June 2023, at a workshop organized by the World Programme, the WTO Secretary-General reported that global exports of digitally delivered services had increased by an estimated 8.1% per year during 2005-22, compared with 5.6% registered for goods exports. In early 2024 the 13th Ministerial Conference resolved to hold a periodic review of the Work Programme

               <p>In February 1996 a Committee on Regional Trade Agreements was established. By January 2024 361 regional trade agreements among WTO member states were in force. The WTO maintains databases of regional trade agreements and of preferential trade agreements (unilateral trade preferences that are notified to it by member states). A new Global Trade Data Portal was inaugurated in May 2023.</p>

               <heading>Agriculture</heading>
               <p>The Final Act of the Uruguay Round extended previous GATT arrangements for trade in agricultural products through new rules and commitments to ensure more predictable and fair competition in the sector. All quantitative measures limiting market access for agricultural products were to be replaced by tariffs, enabling more equal protection and access opportunities. All tariffs on agricultural items were to be reduced by 36% by developed countries, over a period of six years, and by 24% by developing countries (excluding member LDCs) over 10 years. Efforts to reduce domestic support measures for agricultural products were to be based on calculations of total aggregate measurements of support (total AMS) by each member state. A 20% reduction in total AMS was required by developed countries over six years, and 13% over 10 years by developing countries. No reduction was required of LDCs. Developed member countries were required to reduce the value and quantity of direct export subsidies by 36% and 21%, respectively, (on 1986-90 levels) over six years. For developing countries these reductions were to be two-thirds of those of developed nations, over 10 years. Negotiations on the further liberalization of agricultural markets were part of the WTO `built-in' programme, but remained a major area of contention. The Doha Declaration established a timetable for further negotiations on agriculture, which were initially scheduled to be concluded as part of the single undertaking on 1 January 2005. (The deadline was subsequently postponed indefinitely.) A compromise agreement was reached with the EU to commit to a reduction in export subsidies, with a view to phasing them out (without a firm deadline for their elimination). Member states agreed to aim for further reductions in market access restrictions and domestic support mechanisms, and to incorporate non-trade concerns, including environmental protection, food security and rural development, into the negotiations. In December 2005 the sixth WTO Ministerial Conference agreed in principle that export subsidies on cotton should be eliminated, as well as trade-distorting domestic support for cotton exports, and that developed countries would permit the importation of cotton from LDCs duty- and quota-free. In December 2013 the ninth WTO Ministerial Conference agreed that, pending the conclusion of a long-term agreement on agriculture, developing countries should be granted flexibility to implement—without risk of legal challenge, even when agreed limits of trade-distorting domestic support were breached—domestic food stockholding programmes for food security. A further interim measure was approved concerning the handling of persistently under-filled import tariff quotas. In December 2015, under its so-called Nairobi Package of commitments, the 10th Conference decided—representing a landmark commitment in the negotiations process—that developed member states should eliminate the use of agricultural export subsidies on most farm exports immediately, and that most developing countries should implement their removal by 2018, while being permitted to cover transport costs and marketing costs for agriculture exports until the end of 2023. Poorest and food importing nations were granted an extended schedule. The Nairobi Package also included a commitment to seek a permanent agreement on rules for the stockpiling of staple food crops for food security purposes, and a pledge to establish a special stockpiling safeguard mechanism for developing countries. Measures were agreed to support access to new markets for low-income cotton producers.</p>
               <p>The Geneva Package approved in June 2022 by the 12th Ministerial Conference included the Fisheries Subsidies Agreement—providing for the curbing of subsidies for illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. Consensus on a new roadmap to guide agricultural negotiations was not reached at that time; the WTO Director-General noted that differences remained unresolved relating to domestic agricultural sector support, public stockholding of food reserves to maintain food security, cotton, and market access. The Package included a Ministerial Declaration on the Emergency Response to Food Insecurity, which stated concern at the risk posed to the food security of all member states (but particularly least-developed and other developing members) by ongoing trade disruptions, record high prices and excessive volatility for food and agricultural products. The Declaration included a commitment to take concrete actions to enhance the functioning and long-term resilience of global food and agriculture markets, including those for cereals, and for fertilizers and other agriculture production inputs. Any special emergency measures introduced by member states to address ongoing food security concerns were to be targeted, temporary, and, as far as possible, to minimize trade distortions. A new work programme focused on food security for LDCs and net food-importing developing countries (NFIDCs) was initiated in November 2022. Intensive negotiations on agriculture undertaken in early 2024 at MC13 were largely unproductive, with divergences remaining with regard to public stockholding of food reserves, and to imposition of export restrictions on food imported for domestic consumption by the LDCs and NFIDCs. However, agreement was reached on permitting special, differential treatment for developing countries and LDCs—including extending enhanced training on sanitary and phytosanitary measures.</p>

               <p>The WTO Agreement recognizes the need to protect the environment and to promote sustainable development. A Committee on Trade and Environment examines the relationship between trade policies, environmental measures and sustainable development and to recommend any appropriate modifications of the multilateral trading provisions. Plurilateral negotiations were initiated in July 2014 on a WTO Environmental Goods Agreement, with a view to promoting green growth and sustainable development; the discussions were based on a list of 54 environmental goods, including solar panels and wind turbines. Some 18 participants, representing 46 WTO member states, were engaging in that negotiations process in 2024. In November 2020 50 member states initiated a Trade and Environmental Sustainability Structured Discussions (TESSD) format. In December 2021 a Fossil Fuel Subsidy Reform initiative was launched, focused on rationalizing and phasing out subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption.</p>
               <p>In November 2020 WTO initiated an Informal Dialogue on Plastics Pollution and Environmentally Sustainable Plastics Trade, to provide a framework for member discussions on that issue, with a particular focus on challenges confronting small island developing states. A Ministerial Conference on Marine Litter and Plastic Pollution was held in September 2021. A meeting of the Informal Dialogue on Plastics that was convened in March 2023 welcomed the USA as a new co-sponsor of the initiative.</p>

In December 2015 WTO ministers approved `ITA 2’, which expanded the Agreement’s coverage by an additional 201 products (including, 
        <i>inter alia,</i>
         GPS navigation systems, satellites, touch screens, and certain high-tech medical products), in 54 countries, with an annual trading value estimated at US&#160;$1,300,000m. Tariffs on those products were to be eliminated over a three-year period, of which the majority—an estimated 65.3% of tariffs accounting for 88% of imports—had been removed by the EU and USA by 1 July 2016. By January 2024 there were 82 participants in the ITA, representing some 97% of world trade in IT products.

               <heading>Intellectual Property Rights</heading>
               <p>The WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), which entered into force on 1 January 1995, recognizes that widely varying standards in the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights and the lack of multilateral disciplines dealing with international trade in counterfeit goods have been a growing source of tension in international economic relations. The TRIPS agreement aims to ensure that nationals of member states receive equally favourable treatment with regard to the protection of intellectual property and that adequate standards of intellectual property protection exist in all WTO member countries, and that certain obligations are enhanced where necessary (for example, stricter rules of geographical indications of consumer products, a 10-year protection period for industrial designs, and protection for trade secrets and `know-how' with a commercial value).</p>
               <p>Under the agreement member governments are obliged to provide procedures and remedies to ensure the effective enforcement of intellectual property rights, such as injunctions, judicial authority to order the disposal of infringing goods, and criminal procedures and penalties, in particular for trademark counterfeiting and copyright piracy. A Council for Trade-Related Property Rights monitors the compliance of governments with the agreement and its operation. In November 2001 the Doha Ministerial Conference extended the deadline for some of the poorest countries to apply provisions on pharmaceutical patents under TRIPS to 1 ­January 2016; the deadline was extended in November 2015 to 1 January 2033. The Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health, issued in November 2001, affirmed the right of developing countries to protect public health through the full use of flexible TRIPS provisions. The Doha Conference approved a separate decision on implementation-related issues, to address the concerns of developing countries in meeting their WTO commitments. The original deadline of 1 January 2006 for LDCs to bring their legislation and practices into conformity with TRIPS was successively extended by the TRIPS Council: on 29 July 2021 it was set at 1 July 2034.</p>
               <p>
        In January 2017 an amendment to TRIPS entered into force that provided for the production under compulsory licences of generic versions of patent-protected medicines for the specific purpose of exporting them to countries without or with only limited pharmaceutical production capacity. This represented the first amendment to WTO multilateral legislation. In July 2020 the WTO, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) issued an updated version of 
        <publ-name>Promoting Access to Medical Technologies and Innovation</publ-name>
         (originally published in 2013); this outlined an integrated health, trade and IP approach to the challenges raised by the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. In October 2020 India and South Africa jointly proposed that, pending the achievement, globally, of mass vaccination and immunity against COVID-19, a temporary waiver should be applied under TRIPS to certain IP relating to COVID-19 medical tools and technologies, including vaccine patents—with the aim of facilitating international collaboration towards curbing the pandemic. A global petition was handed to the WTO in December, calling for universal access to affordable COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics and equipment. From June 2021 the WTO Director-General participated alongside the heads of the World Bank, IMF and WHO in a Multilateral Leaders Taskforce on vaccines access. A WTO-WHO-WIPO Trilateral COVID-19 Technical Assistance Platform was launched in April 2022. In May the EU, USA, India and South Africa (referred to as `the Quad’) released a document, for consideration by the wider WTO membership, that was to underpin text-based negotiations on COVID-19 IP rights. The Geneva Package approved in June 2022 by the 12th WTO Ministerial Conference included an agreement that provided for a partial IP waiver to enable developing countries to manufacture COVID-19 vaccines and export them to other developing countries. A decision on extending the agreement to cover the production and supply of COVID-19 diagnostics and therapeutics was deferred, initially to December, at which time it was extended indefinitely.

               <p id="WTO.CASEE.219">The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS)—negotiated during the GATT Uruguay Round—represents the first set of multilaterally agreed and legally enforceable rules and disciplines covering international trade in services. A Council for Trade in Services oversees the operation of the Agreement. The 29 articles of GATS include the following set of basic obligations: total coverage of all internationally traded services; national treatment, i.e. according services and service suppliers of other members no less favourable treatment than that accorded to domestic services and suppliers; MFN treatment, with any specific exemptions to be recorded prior to the implementation of the GATS, with a limit of 10 years’ duration; transparency, requiring publication of all relevant national laws and legislations; bilateral agreements on recognition of standards and qualifications to be open to other members who wish to negotiate accession; no restrictions on international payments and transfers; progressive liberalization to be pursued; and market access and national treatment commitments to be bound and recorded in national schedules.</p>
               <p id="WTO.CASEE.221">Annexes to the GATS cover the movement of natural persons, permitting governments to negotiate specific commitments regarding the temporary stay of people for the purpose of providing a service; the right of governments to take measures in order to ensure the integrity and stability of the financial system; the role of telecommunications as a distinct sector of economic activity and as a means of supplying other economic activities; and air transport services, excluding certain activities relating to traffic rights.</p>
               <p id="WTO.CASEE.223">In July 1995 some 29 members signed an interim agreement to grant greater access to the banking, insurance, investment and securities sectors from August 1996. A final, full agreement was concluded in December 1997, under which 102 countries endorsed the elimination of restrictions on access to the financial services sectors from 1 March 1999, and agreed to subject those services to legally binding rules and disciplines; entry into force of the agreement was, however, postponed. An agreement on trade in basic telecommunications (negotiated since May 1994) was concluded in February 1997. Accordingly the largest telecommunications markets, i.e. the USA, the EU and Japan, were to eliminate all remaining restrictions on domestic and foreign competition in the industry by 1 January 1998 (although delays were granted to Spain, until December 1998, Ireland, until 2000, and Greece and Portugal, until 2003). The majority of the signatories to the accord also agreed on common rules to ensure that fair competition could be enforced by the WTO dispute settlement mechanism, and pledged their commitment to establishing a regulatory system for the telecommunications sector and guaranteeing transparency in government licensing.</p>
               <p id="WTO-IO.002">The negotiations to liberalize trade in services, suspended in 1996, were formally reopened in January 2000, with new guidelines and procedures for the negotiations approved in March 2001. The negotiations were incorporated into the Doha Agenda and were to be concluded as part of a single undertaking.</p>

               <p id="WTO.CASEE.231">A separate annex to the WTO agreement determines a unified set of rules and procedures to govern the settlement of all WTO disputes, substantially reinforcing the GATT procedures. WTO members are committed not to undertake unilateral action against perceived violations of the trade rules, but to seek recourse in the dispute settlement mechanism and abide by its findings.</p>
               <p>The agreements that may be cited in the bilateral consultations (first stage) of the disputes process relate to Establishing the WTO (cited in 70 cases by January 2024); Agriculture (cited in 89 cases); Anti-dumping (Article VI of GATT 1994) (143 cases); Customs Valuation (Article VII of GATT 1994) (18 cases); Dispute Settlement Understanding (23 cases); GATT 1947 (one case); GATT 1994 (516 cases); Government Procurement 1979 (four cases); Import Licensing (49 cases); Intellectual Property (TRIPS) (44 cases); Preshipment Inspection (five cases); Rules of Origin (eight cases); Safeguards (62 cases); Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS) (53 cases); Services (GATS) (33 cases); Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (137 cases); Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) (57 cases); Textiles and Clothing (16 cases); Trade-Related Investment Measures (TRIMs) (46 cases); Protocol of Accession (40 cases); and the TFA (four cases). The Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft, the International Bovine Meat Agreement, International Dairy Agreement, and the Revised Agreement on Government Procurement had not been cited in disputes to date.</p>
               <p id="WTO.CASEE.232">The first stage of the process requires bilateral consultations between the members concerned in an attempt to conclude a mutually acceptable solution to the issue. These may be undertaken through the good offices and mediation efforts of the Director-General. Only after a consultation period of 60 days may the complainant ask the General Council, convened as the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB), to establish an independent panel to examine the case, which then does so within the terms of reference of the agreement cited. Each party to the dispute submits its arguments and then presents its case before the panel. Third parties which notify their interest in the dispute may also present views at the first substantive meeting of the panel. At this stage an expert review group may be appointed to provide specific scientific or technical advice. The panel submits sections and then a full interim report of its findings to the parties, who may then request a further review. A final report should be submitted to the parties by the panel within six months of its establishment, or within three months in cases of urgency, including those related to perishable goods. In the case of a measure being found to be inconsistent with the relevant WTO agreement, the panel recommends ways in which the member may bring the measure into conformity with the agreement. However, under the WTO mechanism either party has the right to appeal against the decision and must notify the DSB of its intentions before adoption of the final report.</p>
               <p>By January 2024 621 trade complaints had been notified to the DSB since 1995. During 1995-January 2024 the USA and the EU were the most frequent complainants and respondents in disputes (the USA was complainant in 124; and respondent in 158; and the EU complainant in 110; respondent in 93).</p>
               <p>Technically, appeal proceedings—which are limited to issues of law and the legal interpretation covered by the panel report—are undertaken by three members of the Appellate Body within a maximum period of 90 days. The report of the Appellate Body must be unconditionally accepted by the parties to the dispute (unless there is a consensus within the DSB against its adoption). The DSB monitors the implementation of adopted recommendations and rulings. If action is not undertaken immediately, or within a `reasonable period' as determined by the DSB, the parties are obliged to negotiate mutually acceptable compensation pending full implementation. Failure to agree compensation may result in the DSB authorizing the complainant to suspend concessions or obligations against the other party. During 1995-mid-2020 the Appellate Body circulated 168 final reports. From 11 December 2019 the Appellate Body ceased to hear new cases, as the US Administration had blocked the process to appoint new judges upon the expiry of outgoing judges’ terms. The term of office of the last remaining judge expired on 30 November 2020. Consequently, as at March 2024 the Appellate Body was not operational. In early 2024 the 13th Ministerial Conference adopted a Ministerial Decision that instructed officials to accelerate progress towards establishing a fully functioning dispute settlement system during that year.</p>
               <p usage="edio">By 2024 the largest case hitherto raised in the dispute settlement system was filed in October 2004 by the USA, concerning subsidies provided by the EU to the aircraft manufacturer Airbus SAS; the EU, meanwhile, filed a similar case in June 2005 regarding US government assistance to Boeing. The Appellate Body adjudicated in May 2011 that some EU subsidies to Airbus had been illegal, and in March 2012 it ruled that subsidies granted to Boeing by the US Government were also illegitimate. The dispute continued, and in late March 2019 the WTO Appellate Body awarded the USA the right to impose annual tariffs amounting to US&#8201;$7,500m. on EU imports. In October the USA imposed 10% tariffs on most Airbus products (increased in 2020 to 15%), and 25% tariffs on other goods. In October 2020, meanwhile, the Appellate Body granted the EU the right to impose tariffs of $4,000m. on US products. From March 2021 both sides and the UK (formerly an EU member) suspended the imposition of tariffs, and in June the USA and EU agreed to extend the tariff suspension for five years, and to focus on co-operating in countering the emerging Chinese commercial aircraft industry.</p>

In September 1997, in the first case to be brought under the Agreement, a dispute panel of the WTO ruled that the EU's ban on imports of hormone-treated beef and beef products from the USA and Canada was in breach of international trading rules. In January 1998 the Appellate Body upheld the panel's ruling, but expressed its support for restrictions to ensure food standards if there was adequate scientific evidence of risks to human health.</p>

               <p id="WTO.CASEE.234">The WTO is mandated to pursue co-operation with the IMF and the World Bank, as well as with other multilateral organizations, in order to achieve greater coherence in global economic policymaking. The organization also works with UNCTAD on research, trade and technical issues. The WTO, UNCTAD and the OECD co-operate in undertaking an initiative mandated in 2009 by the G20 nations that aims to combat protectionism and to strengthen aid-for-trade financing-for-trade initiatives. The WTO hosts the secretariat of the Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF), a multi-donor programme in which it co-operates with the IMF, the International Trade Centre, UNCTAD, the UN Development Programme and the World Bank in supporting greater participation by LDCs in the global trading system; EIF funds are channelled through a dedicated EIF Trust Fund. The WTO, the IMF, the World Bank, UNCTAD and ECOSOC participate annually in high-level consultations.</p>

        , which aims to improve market transparency and to help stabilize food price volatility. In 2012 the WTO and the OECD agreed to collaborate on a joint Trade in Value Added (TiVA) series, a publicly accessible database of trade flows estimated in value-added (rather than gross) terms.
