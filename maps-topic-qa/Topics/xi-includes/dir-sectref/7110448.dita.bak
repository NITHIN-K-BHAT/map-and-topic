                              <p>
              Common law is in force in Canada, with the exception of the province of Québec, where 
              <i>le droit civil</i>
               (based on the Napoleonic Code) prevails in private law.
            </p>
                              <p>
              The right to pass legislation on the various aspects of civil law is shared between the federal Parliament and the provincial and territorial legislatures.
              
               Provinces and territories have jurisdiction over contract, property and tort laws, while the federal Parliament has jurisdiction over banking, bankruptcy and insolvency, and patents and copyrights. Jurisdiction is shared on corporation and tax laws.
            </p>
                              <p>The criminal law system of Canada has its origins in the Constitution Act of 1867 (formerly known as the British North America Act) and subsequent amendments, such as the Criminal Code of Canada (1893). Provincial attorney generals have responsibility for criminal prosecutions within their province that fall under the terms of the Criminal Code. The Attorney General of Canada has responsibility for proceedings under federal statutes other than the Criminal Code. All criminal proceedings in the Northwest Territories, Nunavut and Yukon come under the jurisdiction of the Attorney General of Canada.</p>
                              <p>According to the Constitution Act, the administration of justice in the provinces, including the Constitution, maintenance and organization of provincial courts, in both civil and criminal departments, rests with the provincial government.</p>
