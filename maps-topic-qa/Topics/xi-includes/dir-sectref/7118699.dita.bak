                              <p>The Supreme Court is the only Federal Court established by the Constitution. It is the highest court in the nation, comprising a Chief Justice and eight Associate Justices. The Supreme Court has discretionary appellate jurisdiction over disputes concerning the Constitution or federal law.</p>
                              <p>The USA is divided into 12 judicial circuits, in each of which there is one Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has nationwide specialized jurisdiction.</p>
                              <p>Federal Courts hear cases involving federal law, cases involving participants from more than one state, crimes committed in more than one state and civil or corporate cases that cross state lines. Federal District Courts, of which there are 94, are the courts of first instance for most federal suits. The Federal District Courts handle bankruptcy cases, over which they have exclusive jurisdiction.</p>
                              <p>Each state has a judicial system structured similarly to the Federal system, with a Supreme Court and subsidiary courts, to deal with cases arising under State Law. These courts have jurisdiction in most criminal and civil actions. Each state has its own bar association of lawyers and its own legal code.</p>
