The CDIC insures individual deposits against loss because of the insolvency of a member institution. Member institutions may be banks or trust and loan companies. The level of deposit insurance coverage per depositor in each member institution was raised from C $60,000 to $100,000 with effect from February 2005. The CDIC’s board comprises a chairperson (appointed by the Governor-in-Council), five ex officio directors (the Governor of the Bank of Canada, the Deputy Minister of Finance, the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, a Deputy Superintendent of Financial Institutions and the Commissioner of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada) and five private sector members. Some 43 member institutions have failed since the CDIC’s creation. The amount of insured deposits at the end of March 2023 totalled $1,082,000m., covering 159 member institutions.</p>
