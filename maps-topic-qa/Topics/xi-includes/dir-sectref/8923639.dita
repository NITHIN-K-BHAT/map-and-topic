                                   <p id="CA.DIR.792" usage="ewyb usac">The Bank Act of 1980 created two categories of banking institution: Schedule I banks, in which no one interest was allowed to own more than 10% of the shares; and Schedule II banks, which are either subsidiaries of foreign financial institutions, or are banks controlled by Canadian non-bank financial institutions. By 1 January 1995, the previous domestic asset limitations on foreign-owned Schedule II banks in the Canadian market were removed. </p>
                                   <p usage="ewyb usac">In 1999 the Government adopted legislation permitting foreign banks to establish independent operations in Canada without their being obliged to establish Canadian-incorporated subsidiaries. Foreign bank branches (known as Schedule III banks) are prohibited from accepting deposits of less than C $150,000. The Bank Act Reform of 2001 provided for much greater flexibility of the financial services system and also included an increase in the maximum level of single ownership in large banks from 10% to 20%, while any one interest was henceforth permitted to control as much as 65% of a medium-sized bank; the minimum amount of capital required to apply for a bank licence was halved to $5m.</p>
                                   <p usage="ewyb usac">In February 2024, according to the Canadian Bankers Association, there were 80 banks operating in Canada. At November 2023 the combined assets of all banks totalled $8,806,204.2m., of which domestic banks accounted for 98.3%.</p>

                The first Canadian commercial bank was founded in 1817. A further 34 banks were established over the next 50 years, and, fo
                
                llowing confederation in 1867, the Bank Act of 1871 gave the federal Government regulatory powers over banking operations throughout Canada. Canadian banks operate according to laws set out in the Bank Act and are chartered by the federal Parliament. While the number of banks diminished during the 20th century, the number of branches increased greatly.

                                   <p usage="ewyb usac">At the end of October 2022, there were some 5,656 bank branches in Canada. The sector is dominated by five banks—the Royal Bank of Canada, the Toronto-Dominion Bank, the Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank), the Bank of Montréal and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. At November 2023 the combined assets of these banks totalled C $7,770,180.2m., accounting for 88.2% of total banking assets.</p>
